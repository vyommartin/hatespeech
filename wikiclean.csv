3,morei cant make any real suggestions on improvement i wondered if the section statistics should be later on or a subsection of types of accidents i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc. i can do that later on if noone else does first if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know.there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up. its listed in the relevant form eg wikipediagoodarticlenominationstransport ,0

21,reconsidering st paragraph edit?i dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that im sure that the data are necessarily wrong. rather im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject. i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement. in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. a. benjamin cardozo a. learned hand b. john marshall harlan b. john marshall harlan iithe question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? i think not.perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale.at a minimum im questioning this edit? it deserves to be reconsidered. ,0

32,not at all you are making a straw man argument here. i never claimed odonohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position which is exactly what the quote says and also something odonohue agrees with. again i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd. the disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do. at the end of the day it is a value judgment as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement. if we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis. ,0

43,jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a rightwing force? as far as im aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all. the consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin hamish mcdonald roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show.the only dissenters im aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. for example even the foremost scholary expert on fascism and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy renzo de felice doesnt try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status. this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini. ,0
44,bi you said you wanted to talkat the bottom of the lead section you have writtenits promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials.regarding in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materialsthat statement appears to come from ref on page . the full quote isif the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payloadthen that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringlyfeasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible inthe near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higheroperational temperatures.it then goes on to sayas we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastoltethers needed. the primary message we want to leave with the reader is“we dont need magic materials like ‘buckminsterfullercarbonnanotubes’ to makethe space tether facility for a hastol system. existing materials will do.”so it would appear that you misread your reference. the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem. systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials.to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report statesthe fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept istechnically feasible. we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that willallow hypersonic airbreathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning spacetether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth intoearth orbit. for more than one hastol architecture concept we have developed a designsolution using existing or nearterm technologies. we expect that a number of the otherhastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected todetailed design studies. the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drasticallyreducing the cost of earthtoorbit space access.regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general the nonspinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts..the full quote ishyperskyhookin zubrin proposed the “hypersonic skyhook” as a solution to the mismatch betweenthe attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers.since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0

68,is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent? dont answer the questions beyond thatwell the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here. first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean really. second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand. id is just making up their numbers. finally your example has a>b where b was deliberate design. thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown. your a>b example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him. you dont have that with life on earth. you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test. so in that sense a>b is not scientific if youve never actually observed b. btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed. so in that sense no it isnt science. ,0

97, czech republic is in central europe. the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions. especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region. countries are located within continents yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent. this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers. im tired of arguing with people who are essentially wikisquatters refusing to nudge on a given article. ... ,0

99,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized. however the term fossilized is not a very precise term. there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil. one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc. and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc. talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned.the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in? experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue. the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains. flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working. much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains. yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.,0

143,== attributing and classifying of personalities == invitation. your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed. some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here. i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word. necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania. we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat. renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us. cultural aspirations of the later nat. ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of lithuania. but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically lithuanian. i mean that such authors in as čiurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of lithuanian culture when in european or worldwide context. a parallel example may be taken from literature of india. poet tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india. making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture. but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones. this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n. ren. could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in lithuanian context. they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture. čiurlionis is the best example here. in other way the later lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life see the table below. we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramūnas bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism. period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period the younger generation approx – painter and composer čiurlionis painter kazys šimonis poet and philosopher vilius storastas vydūnas dramatist sofija kymantaitė čiurlionienė poets adomas jakštas motiejus gustaitis liudas gira composer stasys šimkus philosopher ramūnas bytautas. reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and postwar years. poets v mykolaitis putinas kazys binkis writer ignas šeinius – jurkūnas artists all ars group philosopher juozas girnius modernists introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life central european modernism. note lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence. jul utc,0

176,i dont at all propose that it should be transcribed as meːn in this or any other article. if anything at all just a brief mention of the raising of trap and mouth in a prenasal environment would suffice. i just thought it was an american thing to raise before nasals i do it myself but i often hear aussies do it quite a bit as well and i dont hear english people do it at all. the only difference is that americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it. im not really surprised you dont have a broad accent being a wikipedian. im not saying its not possible.youre right i was just kind of thinking aloud.,0
177,homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior. therefore they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay. in this way their way of life will be received as being not only harmless but perfectly normal. as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality. in this way it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being similar to a religion race or nationality. lestrade,0

182,a totallydisputed notice would probably be appropriate given the depth of disagreement that exists here but i cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article. slimvirgin has also used that wording recently but i rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice.to answer your second question my side has brought forward a proposal and the other side has not yet responded. this is sadly consistent with recent patterns of delay. ill make no comment on whether or not this is a deliberate strategy. ,0

190, randroide answers to next step guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation.i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software. i do not want that happenning.could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided?. thank you. randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something...of course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there. come oooooon boys start writing that section. i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me. but remember npov and sources all the sources. just like me citing el país in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb. cheers indeed a good point. and all the remarks in cope too. and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo. i agree with you % larean. what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely pov as is much of the rest of the proposed article. also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not. you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits... section.if you have not subscription to el país i am sorry but that´s your problem. my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el país and many many other publications and books. that´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss it´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.do you see?. the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources.btw if you write under a randroide answers section you areinvading my space. i do not mind really. but you are doing it.risking new truncations on your messages. to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections.if you think that the proposed article is pov work in it to make it npov. the article is not mine. ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short. the issue is not whether i subscribe to el país its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the articlevery funny southofwatford. i am going to follow this joke of yours.please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know? there is always someone without this or that book.delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home.delete all the references in spanish because did you know? there are users who know no spanish.it´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really. i had a good laugh.usersouthofwatford how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre. equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response. ,0

204,the organization of subtopics. culture is thrown way down towards the end after economy and tourism which is inappropriate. the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography which makes it not only uninteresting but also repetitive. information is interspersed all through the subsections without regard to whether or not they fit there. eg the geography section starts with the fact that up is the th largest state. that is not strictly geography and belongs in the introduction. climate belongs towards the latter part of the page perhaps before toursim. regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. in any case cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own because up has several interesting cities and regions each with specialities of its own like the copperware of moradabad ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi. in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before. ,0
205,i dont know the answer to this butlegally how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizens civil rights?i dont know if this is the section nelson was charged under in the federal case but if anyone could explain this i would appreciate it.you can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified thats really not my concern here since its a dead letter. im concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal. if the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice its not the first time. look at issei sagawa. part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isnt perfect and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted and that guilty people will be acquited from time to time. thats the price you pay for having a legal system in the end someone has to make the decision and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right. i dont think its going out on a limb to say that the sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.,0
206,decesed group members ive seen a few articles where band members have their name sollowed by deceased. whats wrong witht that? its just a little extra information for people who do not already know this. surely this is the main reason such the articles exist in the first place or even why the whole wikipedia site exists whats so bad about adding this word after peoples names if they are no longer with us? it is factual nonopinionative and does not slate them in anyway.,0

286,...s rantpresently we are witnessing an open war against croatian dinaric culture. croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of conservative hdz party. croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergović refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players. some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all štokavian people and their culture are serbian. however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian. dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljević is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovićs book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje . also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in dubrovnik . even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijović kočan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijović kočan gusle glasnik may p. . dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatović a daughter of famous gusle player ante. although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry. not far from dubrovnik another coastal city makarska – was also a bastion of croatian gusle music. actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players. this mediterranean area also gave birth to andrija kačić miošić th century catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond. to honour kačićs work ivan meštrović the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kačić in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument. in addition to kačić makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music. according to dr. fra karlo jurišić who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banović zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovićkudrić and culminating with the most known mate banović – trliš . as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound. olinko delorko the researcher of dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of hvar. the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. english writer maude m. holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p.this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and hinterland. matija murko the researcher of this literary/music forms had reported that during his trips through dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredečki “hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme” željeznobeč p. now lets take a look at the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc. what do they have in common? of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost extinct. why do we have so few gusle players today ? is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture ? if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre,0

308,the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treatiesbaldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections. standfordham wrote to the king on october i saw mr baldwin who in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out? said yes but not on the campbell issue but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns. he sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the governments fall. ... ... and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwins strictures based on the campbell case – at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement achieved at a conference in london on the dawes plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the russian agreement. but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion. two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—middlemas and barnes p. . ,0

386,unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once. frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page. rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions. ,0

393,has anyone ever considered including tagteam edit warring as a rr violation? when two people act in tandem unintentionally or intentionally to make the same revert four times they may not technically violate the rr rule but they certainly do so in spirit. this was the problem on both sides in the edit war on the canada page and precisely what i wanted to avoid on the dominion page. would it not be easier to warn editors as you did here rather than shut down pages for weeks at a time as was done in the canada case? im sure this would cure the escalation problem without blocking access to pages. any comments on this?,0

395,yes i do hope to get it to ga status in the future. wpmostv states that for fictional characters their storylines should come first and then the information on their creation and characterization. it makes more sense to read about what storylines the character has been involved in before going into the production of it all. the same style is used for articles on books films and television shows/episodes. ,0

403,biased unreliableemotionally written by armenin wiki editors==pls stop using the wikipedia for your dirty propaganda and lobbying purposes. there was no genocide. this is a amyth advanced by the armenian church and armenian fundamentalist fascists. a nation can not be subject to a egnocide when it has several heros for whom you can see statues in yerevan irevan. jews dont have it. the resolution is the act of some sold congressmen who want to appease the armenian lobby. it has no reliable valid and neutral content. it is kjust a piece of dirty and lie facts presented and written by christian missionaries working to kill turks and kurds in s. you can claim to be subject to genocide as much as you want. but this thing did never happen. some armenian fundamentalists and fascists who were killing kurds turks and azerbaijanis were killed by great sons of the turkic nation and i am proud of them. go and propogate your lie as much as you can. you will achieve nothing. raman==,0

433,in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims. it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp. the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue. this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.,0

441, august utcdear the hour block that you placed on my account yesterday for personal attacks has just expired and while i must say that i was not happy about the block i harbor no hard feelings towards you. if you check my previous contributions you can see that i have been a productive editor on wikipedia. id just like to let you know that while i was guilty of personal attacks against and i was goaded into doing so by these two individuals. in order to avoid future blocks i promise not to engage in anymore personal attacks and if i am goaded by trolls such as these two individuals i will simply ignore them. was repeatedly reverting a comment which i made concerning statements made in the hugo chavez article which i found to be biased. my issue with concerns his nastiness and uncivility. he is far too possessive of articles which he has created and he becomes very angry when edits are made to such articles. after multiple revisions of legitimate edits which i made to his articles i told him to leave me alone. he proceeded to foul my discussion page with unwanted and unsolicited comments. when i objected to this he goaded me into calling him a profanity.while i respect your role as a wikipedia administrator id like to respectfully request that in the future you exercise better discretion when blocking a user based on onesided information. thank you for your understanding ,0

474,all of those statements need to be referenced. leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information. to point out one thing ill bring up consolidated appropriations act . first it has a number of tags on it the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag. second the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that. it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link. its possible that some came from this as well i cant tell. ill also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic so the article is riddled with grammatical errors mostly incomplete sentences. on creation the opening read consolidated appropriations act h.r. is a bill passed to the th united states congress ive never heard this usage to rather than by and assume it is incorrect another editor changed it the lead is also missing an important determiner. in any case you can take a look at  vesey ,0

494, tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and u.s. jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. i appreciate that the situation in the u.s. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech. to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city. in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas. saying that dla has has offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china ... would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research. i do accept that dla with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible. ,0

501,nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time. the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it. he/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed his/her mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on was on him/her not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago ... decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that. does or add clutter? sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt he/she even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about / of the entire article dealt with norman schwarzkopf an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaith/goodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles. he/she was involved in blocking input to the article. why? was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying. i dont really have time for this. i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles. i could pretend this user didnt do what he/she did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense. i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative. as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles. the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. also i dont recal ever having called him/her a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently. his/her behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems. i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper he/she isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english. i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon. nothing new under the sun here. if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all. i know whats going on. i dont know why but i dont have to and i expect the motivations arent interesting. respond if you have anything to say. ,0

520,meters sigh and my concerns only because mr meter had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far i did not have a single chance to develop it. his article called ¨falsetto¨ is not about falsetto. it may be about his arrogance who knows. there are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto. there are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which mr meter such anxiously protects. in england italy or spain th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. on the top of it mr meter perhaps never heard pavarotti singing falsetto or the falsetto of ian gillan. singing of king diamond is based on falsetto. what about michael kiske? is it not falsetto? mariah carey or whitney houston do did not sing falsetto? does any of these falsettos sound breathy? not to me. isnt out there published a note about those? maybe only because meter does not look for it. why? it would not fit to his article. he would have to admit that his only source vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. meter quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the world. the whole physiology of his ¨only¨ falsetto is based on encyclopedia? well perhaps it is enough for wikipedia or himself. but not for me. no. there is much more out there only regarding physiology. much much more. and just because you allow idiots like meter to ¨develop¨ wikipedia the people the readers of wikipedia will read shit. where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at ies mr know everything? feel free to block me again. i have no desire to write here any more.,0

524, removed pov i removed undo criticism of secretary boutwell and pov. wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. the following has been removed from the article.boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation. intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. he believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception henry adams wrote in a muchquoted analysis in . he believed in common schools and not in political science in ledgers and cashbooks but not in adam smith or mill as one might believe in the multiplicationtable but not in laplace or newton. by a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.henry adams the session north american review july p. . but in a very corrupt time it spoke well of boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his cabinet post either for himself or his friends. living within his salary he lodged in a boardinghouse throughout his tenure. his only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money. chicago times march . he is an inaccessible man uninfluenced by fear favor affection or hope of reward and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred a new england politician wrote his brother. henry f. french to benjamin b. french march benjamin b. french papers library of congress.boutwells financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments but while boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of washington remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.,0

526, question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question i dont pay much attention to that page. in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. i havent yet worked in no original research. wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i dont see how that can be objective. bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al. but ive been somewhat overloaded at work. personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob. yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note i appreciate it i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication. ive never done any such thing. or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequencesive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isnt namecalling by a long stretch. im really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me wont make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. its the internet equivalent of stoning. this is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly. putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult. ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response. and please notice like abi avi is avraham the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness i counseled against piling on. talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen. yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite. thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh,0

570, philosopher rfc philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead. this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career. note not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present. the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place. definitions obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article. philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ... anarchocapitalist anarchocapitalism ... is a political philosophy... voluntaryist voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy... athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy... primary source as stefan molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims. if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place. i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to. freedomain radio about page my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens. i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio. i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy. freedomain radio the show that molyneux hosts has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly universally preferable behaviour upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods? a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies. strong atheism the case for evacuating the middle ground article why i am a philosopher? video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy. an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts reality knowledge truth gods/religion ethics and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable. proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video philosophy questio,0

591, wikipediaarticles for deletion/cheongye kwan your post at the above afd on a new martial art bothers me. this was the version at the time that you based your post on. you posted i just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines... it is reliably sourced... since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied... it now has independent sources. and to refute the argument posed by wayne it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised.please consider the concerns this post raises. simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin. in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. i dont have a word for it. unreal is close.the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability. the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website. a casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny < sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too. the lau philip la interview. entries marked reference and support of written reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence. a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper.in brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal i think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited and/or written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall.your assessment of these at afd was it is reliably sourced{ style=borderccc solid px width=% there is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts. probably via selfpromotional input. there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.} that the cited pages are evidence of notability{ style=borderccc solid px width=% they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it?} that the sources are independent{ style=borderccc solid px width=% are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host} that the cites show it is nonlocalized{ style=borderccc solid px width=% the page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it. the reference openly stated cambridge university and bristol taekwando a big indication of its actual source when a link was provided on request it turns out it,0

597, stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments. i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information. the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here. there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain. the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group i.e. hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view. hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy. thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons. for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia. this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different. still it is dissapointing. happy trails. ,0

623, why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.i reject such a stance. i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial. where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth. this is wrong. wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is. any attempt to do that is original research.instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability. put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources. if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that. if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict. where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or pov on the topic at hand.i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. obviously is because some users jadger and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their pov thats not discussion about the npov edits. thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ ,0
624, regarding loyalmoonie and lgbt categories looked into it and this editor seems to be pushing an antilgbt agenda. theyve done similar stuff over at sailor moon and made officiallooking warnings to other editors. this quote is bizarre and is quite telling to insert those categories would ultimately give other people who may not even support the lgbt movement reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy sailor moon is a homosexual and/or supports ssm. i dont personally watch/read sailor moon or know much about it so im not confident enough to readd the categories but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless and there is a sourced part in the article about female ,0

631,agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. i was concentrating on the polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the czech experience needs to be included. czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s had closer ties with the west than poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was the west politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with poland. that said i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland the baltics yugoslavia or even ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea. while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war i think that the articles focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. after all there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union too who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy. oct utc,0

644,the spelling tacarimba la tumba del fuego santa maliga sacategas lo onto del sol y cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of side by side by sondheim available for rental only. this version of the song however misspells llanfair pg presumably to approximate the pronunciation and has the lyric ...todays the last ill be spreading rather than spending. it would seem therefore that this source cannot be considered canonical. this rendering of the place name does accord with millicent martins recording on the side by side by sondheim cast album however.the published version of the song as contained in the hansen treasury of stephen sondheim songs charles hansen music books has the lyric printed as tacarembo la tumbe del fuego santa malipas zacatecas la junta del sol y cruz and being a printed source as opposed to handwritten as is the vocal score can presumably be considered definitive. linda lavins pronunciation on the original cast recording of the mad show for which the song was written follows this spelling which would suggest that the printed version is correct.as it is a fictional place name however any discussion of correct spelling/pronunciation is an academic one at best.,0

676,speedy deletion of phi rho eta a tag has been placed on phi rho eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. for legal reasons we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material and as a consequence your addition will most likely be deleted. you may use external websites as a source of information but not as a source of sentences. this part is crucial say it in your own words.if the external website belongs to you and you want to allow wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement i name am the author of this article article name and i release its content under the terms of the gnu free documentation license version . and later. you might want to look at wikipedias policies and guidelines for more details or ask a question here. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0

678,i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth’s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. i think that the img reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty. i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teethbut bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article. i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by offriorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth’s biography. perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which i suspect should not be difficult—that it can be reincluded? i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment. actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle. ,0
679, greek love im looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. im leaving a note here because you closed this afd where i made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. there are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp. i complain here about their coordination. other editors including and i simply cant do it any longer. i havent changed my position on the validity of the article but ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided. im done. i need to limit my time on wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. when ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it. im not asking you to do anything im just explaining why i cant keep my word as given at the afd. wow that is a no hard feelings on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. i have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world. sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore. best of luck in your future endeavors here. mailchimp im not that bothered but i think that the mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake. it did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance something that was supposed to be the original problem. the criteria specifies a credible claim of significance. wordpress pages are not reliable sources. however i would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today. talkback talk just a hunch?call it my intuition but im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does. just my cents. cheers ♠♣♥♦™№©♪♫® there are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy. if you have any evidence of socking file at wpspi. recreation of article shay carl i would like to request that the article shay carl be recreated see the deleted talkshay carl for my reasons note talkshay carl was delete because of a not notibility. well there was,0

695,my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. that was like the nd day almost two months ago.all of my references are nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation. i didnt put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge.i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. for instance i wrote to the aba and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article. i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view. those references were deleted by someone i cant remember who and dont know why. at this point the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid transcript. the guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers. even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for. i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.i dont believe that i did any original research. all i did is search the internet for references for the article. i really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article. i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf which date back to . also when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst.i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway. same as the u.n. covenantcant really hide that. i didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously. like today i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which i think is because of judge learned hand who was in the fifth circuit. and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se no there was not. what i found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly.i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing. i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. ive been an entrepreneur. i didnt know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article. that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article. the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article.arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself. one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i havent got it yet. but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state slave state border state. also there were issues related to indians in some of the western states. the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too i think. so did the history of workmens comp which is of course related to unions. ,0

706,referring to her as catherine i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone living or dead by their st names on wp if a female had a title she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy or lady dudley for amy robsart even though lady amy was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become lady dudley until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amys life nor was she then lady amy dudley as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke. i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just amy throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles but was told it was against wp rules though i wasnt pointed to a link for it. noblewomen are usually called by their st names round here as far as i can see even when they have surnames are not of something mary boleyn is called mary not lady carey or lady stafford catherine neville is called catherine not the duchess of norfolk etc theyre not royals. as for males i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley. i was banging head on keyboard going but no one just says the king all the time or refers to them as plantagenet or keeps changing their titles ie henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as catherine throughout the article without her title appended? ive only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me as my main interest is british history i am quite confused.,0

708,they are all cunts its not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue. all sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never ever change. they advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know. soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites independent information in general will be extinguished. wikipedia a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science. the new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to crosscheck facts through other perspectives. with few small independent sites left with no or few free university pages left real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them ...,0

719,dect isnt really a new technology. its a newer standard but tdm/tdma/fdma digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of dect. dect is itself a successor to ct japans phs is very similar and of course gsm damps and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. to suggest there are special health issues with dect would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. dect is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces both during transmissions and inherently because even when in use the td nature of the system means the system isnt transmitting continuously.as i believe ive said before there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of lowpower radio technology and there being a link in the see also section of this article to it. that article of course should look nothing like the section i yanked. there is nothing about dect however that merits a special section on dects dangers especially when new technology or otherwise there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.,0

743,words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propagandadamemk you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia.userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not.he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia.how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda.hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources.i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals.i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports.damemk i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkdamemk and usertalkejanev is not the same user. some insight into my user name ejanevthe only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev. it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev.user damemk is a separate user. probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia.it does happen that i am from canada. i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years.and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia.i am not the only user/editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles.you can watch the contributions of specialcontributions/laveol and see that more than % of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes. ,0

770,replacementplease do not edit below this note. the whole suprasection will disappear again once i am able to post on the article talk page.this includes you shell. had you not blocked me i would have been able to place my answers there. this will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.because shell falsely blocked me i cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. hence i will save the entire page minus the archived sections here. pov concerns im surprised this article isnt being called antisemetic because its has a few traces of islamic perspectives in it. you know as opposed to being a piece of zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.this entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. it is well documented the banu qurayza were executed for treason. that is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason. the quarash and other tribes the muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. but the qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy. this article contains soo much jewish propaganda that youd think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim. here is a great example. look at this citationaccording to stillman muhammad chose sad ibn muadh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the banu qaynuqa and the banu nadir sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. furthermore stillman infers from abu lubabas gesture that muhammad had decided the fate of the qurayza even before their surrender.this author is norman a stillman a zionist jew who is very biased. why is he being used as a quote in an islamic article? and further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if its a fact?there are articles for criticisms of islam where the jews and others can write whatever they want. but they should have no hand in editing islamic articles. because i looked up the jewish articles and i noticed they dont allow dissent there. you cant put a muslim perspective on evil acts commited by jews without it disappearing instantly. so the same standard must be applied to islamic articles. islamic articles must be written from the islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of islam articles. if not i will personally edit the jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. and i will find a nonjewish admin to arbitrate over the islamic articles.good day. please read this talk page specifically all of the places where treason or traitor is mentioned and if you still believe that we need to mention treason provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it. it is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all povs but it does require that people like yourself participate. we work from academic sources not personal conjecture. changes by devotus and issues with themdear devotus i have still issues with your changesbat yeor and ramadan while i appreciate that you dont try you shift the balance removing a book from each side i do not agree with your removal. bat yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial she is not beyond the pale currently she doesnt serve as a reference in the article but if she did the controversy would be noted. as for ramadan i have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section we would have to remove him from the article too in which he serves as a reference. this is due to the insistence of userbless sins. he will certainly not like such a removal. we cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.while your first version was needlessly verbose it is to be noted that the new one endorses that view by paret/watt. the article now says that the bq were not killed for religious reasons that is not a fact since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the siege and demise e.g. the claim about attacking m. in the rear.also please abide by the one resolved conflict. we fought hard and long about words like massacre and execution and neither should appear unless unavoidable.the common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s,0

795,well arthur i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what says it is not your correction. it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless.you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. so lets do that.we want a function f satisfying f=e and fn+=expfn defined as widely as possible. we observe that n= and n= present no problems f= and f=.to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as .and we want f to be continuously differentiable. the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on . this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because a=e.next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f is monotone on the interval . from the functional equation fx = ln fx+ we get f x = f x+/fx+. hence f =f /f=f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx = expxexpxx.thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and .,0

803,lol you know what i meant. whichever president came before hafez i just new he was president before assad has considerable foreground of support in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. they would have claimed instability would arise as assads supporters are trying to use in their defense. what i am trying to say is that although bashar assad had good economic and international policies for syria you should not fear a nonbaathist potentially being elected. syrias economic and international policies wont change iran would still be a major factor in syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms and for the better. also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. the muslim brotherhood in syria is weak even weaker than the islamist prescence in libya. the rebels in libya had % support as we see now and yet could hardly take control without nato. what chance does the syrian muslim brotherhood have? none. if anything nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the muslim brotherhood making them less of an influence in the everyday life of syrians. as you know i am pro syria and armenia just not pro assad. unlike armenia where people like sargsyan and kopcharyan were democratically elected assad was not no one ran against him because they were not allowed.,0
804, cfr is a perfectly accurate source. the council on foreign relations is a recognized legitimate thinktank that studies international terrorisim for the united staes govt. to claim they are not credible is idiotic.they are as legitimate as any online newspaper or other source. they have studied northern ireland and compliled a list of uda/uvf killed by the ira/inla and vice versa. these facts are good and will be included in the article.,0
805, lead whats there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize which the case at salvatore giunta is not. it simply copies whole sentances from the body text. as an editor we have to assess the article as it currently stands and not any hypothetical future stance. if the article grows then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. in any case the lead section i favored does indeed summarize the most important part the moh.in any case did you read wplead? the lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject but assert thier claim to notability. the two sentances i favored more than do that without being overly repetitive. wordsdeeds ,0
806,{{unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine. why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?. for exampleand this is... yep maybe you guessed it... question why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name... like say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor? specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid?. heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor?. ready for one more? then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment ?. oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking rr that says that but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense? well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say? well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give her/him a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingright/matchingconsensusisnodefense rule?... ,0

809, trying to measure the number of cafes this is one of those places where i am so frustrated by wikipedias ban on original research. the article has the absurdly low at least six cafes on the ave or its alleys. i dont know where that number comes from nor what they consider a cafe but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition the scene includes solstice cafe zoe the original allegro on an alley parallel to the ave arguably its second location in the college inn also counts the ugly mug half block off the cafe at the corner of nd that used to be the roma but i cant recall its new name sureshot the continental caffe apassionato wow bubble tea shinka tea company yunnie bubble tea pochi tea gingko tea house tullys starbucks wannabee one block off still life on the ave at the grand illusion technically the entrance is around the corner but it is clearly effectively on the ave.this doesnt even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints nor does it count things like u. bookstore and bulldog news both of which have busy espresso operations nor does it count ice cream stands. and im sure im missing something this is all just offhand. talk ,0
810,actually undue weight can also results in zero weight. as it is the whole issue is insinuation and extrapolation of given events. just because the article doesnt outright say that edwards is the father because there was no father listed it is quite clear that this is the intent. now editors familiar with me consider me to be a fnc fanboy and appolgist regarding conservatives and republicans so my objection to this is clearly not a partisan point of view. that said this is in violation of several wp policies.,0

844,your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per wikipedia guidelines until jayjg and slimvirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article and reverting it to what we have now as punitive gestures. if we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better instead of punishing each other there is no reason the article has to be locked.i agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on. however a definition doesnt do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information. if there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism that would be better than no definition at all intimidate for instance. ,0

875, bloc voting countries with large populations of nonnationals may have their televote influenced considerably. this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia. this is fullblown crazy. what does nonnationals mean? these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa. people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries there are some refugees in each of those countries but that doesnt really explain why croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to serbia or macedonia to serbia where there was no conflict to speak of. for example im a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual. but im not a bosnian nonnational. i have the passport of bih and my family has never lived in serbia in history. its really about mutual intelligibility which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. its the language and sensibility.,0

890,i was trying to inject some humour as evidenced by my winky face in this ridiculous overblown and unnecessarily dramatic situation. if you took the time to familiarize yourself with the situation you would see that the person i insulted was attacking my cited and factual contributions by actively censoring them no explanation which i retaliated with by insulting him. i thought that his conduct was insultworthy at the time as would any sane individual who was not familiar with wikipedias noinsult rule however i have since realized that what i did was wrong because this site does not allow for harsh words which is why i will not use them again even if they are used against me which they were during this ordeal.wikipedia is the place for me because my edit was constructive and brought a greater knowledge to the subjects topic. but the fact that i insulted another user in the edit summary is regrettable and i know that now.if you seriously think the edit linked above constitutes a better insult ,0

908,dunfermline article and new pictures for the kirkcaldy collage hello again. ive been looking at the paragraph about the kingsgate shopping centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the s specifically between and if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years. but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway. about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources.also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference kingsgate extension on schedule for august opening by mivan. as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status. thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the kingsgate and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date. that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to mutt luckers home page. it is now on his talk page if you want to see it mutt lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the beveridge park pond. as well as this i have another new picture of the old kirk tower which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website the clock has been restored since that pic. and would like to upload it.,0

936,thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously. to reiterate my original explanatoin to james im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about. for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article. see for example something like roe v. wade theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case. even if you really consider moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of godwins law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be. similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there? jul utc,0

959,this is untrue. i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true. it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me. usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing. the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false. i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently. having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulent..ism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me etc. is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate. in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so. although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc. that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system.there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this.you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc. so that is also impossible.                       ,0

984,your continual removal and attempt at hiding said removal of specific references on the page that properly attribute the author title and publication date of works in accordance with with standard academic practices and wikipedia policy is in fact tendentious. clearly an agenda. its frankly remarkable to me that not one of the reviewers or friends of your talk page that you summoned to this page has dared to comment on this abomination.,0

986,as you kinow it yourself you are not elligible nor credible nor a reliable source of neutrality in this case as you are yourself a mormon and all you do is to support other mormons without following any wikipedias rules but your own churchs solidarity.i dont believe that any of you has even the intention of being straightforward with non mormon or to be a little bit honest but that the alone thing that activate you is your own religious believe and the pedantisme to think that all you may say or do is auto righteous in the name of the church and all the illusions you dream of with open eyes.i dont want a mormon admi i dont want a mmormon admi i dont want a mormon admi to look into this case but an exterm¨n al one with no relations nor conacts what so ever with this church nor its representants or members.if you cant do that must be because your circle of admi friends is around the church or because you know very deeply that all you did was deeply unappropriate and wont stand a micro mile in a wiki trail.i am mad very mad at you also because you ignore what i have say so why should i care about your saying and doing if we have to be neutraly equal?any idea?i want the text who was deleeted from the archive it is unacceptable that a text is deleeted from archive and from the edit history just one hour after it was reverted and less than a day after it was written without any previous warning of any kind about it.this is all about wiki rules and you have broken them all.,0

995, july utcwell yes thats fine but the point here is that there is no publishers statement made about anything in that sentence. the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. if the resource says joe at worms then we write joe ate worms. about tarnishing any reputation that isnt the point at all. and about accepted practices in the publishing world this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. about people keeping records of how many books were published i think you missed the point there. publishers weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. they are a secondary source. do you see how thats different? about the article on fip it hadnt any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. fip and are the same entity. facim is also the same entity. this is known. having the same board of directors as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim® etc. makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources. ,0

1038, can someone explain criticism to me? this is taken from the criticisms section of the article. since logic is inherently constant and that some things are more true than others it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. an example of a similar phenomenon is the gay marriage debate in the u.s. an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. can someone explain what exactly this means? i do not follow the first half of the paragraph the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me especially this part...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.i do not think thata the majority in question believes that it doesnt apply to them. though im not sure what it is in this context so the sentence may be true. the majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society which of course applies to everybody in that society.b the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views. its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed for the benefit of society it is aware of the effects and does not object to them. ,0

1060,and paganismsouthgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university rejected catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition’ including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a ´ satru´ alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party. further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins. southgate believed that wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity’. another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate roman emperor julian ii.this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’. the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmler’s ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’ the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’. for southgate as for evola tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene. this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothicindustrial dark ambient black and ‘viking’ metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth. although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging ‘antiantiestablishment’ probush rightwing punk movement. although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’. southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.this is not simply cynical manipulation. southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. his fanzine tribal resonance ‘the voice of the racial avantgarde’ reveals southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’. through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’ southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance. by creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.the struggle for cultural heg,0

1063,ok ill try to sort through your latest post here. let me know if i misinterpret something.first you specify a theory axiomatic system namely zfcp+ppomega exists. lets call that t for easy reference.now you argue that t proves the existence of a model lets call it m the because its not a model of t but of a new theory such thatm satisfies zfcppomega is in m. now do you mean the real pomega or do you mean that m satisfies pomega exists that is that theres an element of m that m thinks is pomega? im guessing the latter that m satisfies pomega exists.you say aleph is in the model and is less than or equal to the cardinality of pomega. again im guessing you mean that this is in the models opinion that is m satisfies the statement exists and .ok so going with my guesses thus far i agree that t proves the existence of such an m. m might be for example mg where m equals which is a model for t and g is mgeneric for the partial order to add cohen reals.,0

1081,==proposed move to stiffness to weight ratio==why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property? google returns results for specific modulus results for specific stiffness and results for stiffness to weight ratio.i could understand this if wikipedia were advocating the term specific modulus e.g. because it is shorter or more technical sounding or whatever. however my understanding was that wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term. in this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.this name has the further benefit of being selfexplanatory whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.i therefore propose moving this article to stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it. this wont compromise findability in any way but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term. ,0
1082, why commonwealth instead of dominion? based upon comparing the governments of the dominion of canada and the commonwealth of australia i dont really understand the differences. the idea of a commonwealth seems to compare directly with that of a republic so if the queen of great britain and northern ireland is the queen of australia how can one style australia a commonwealth? would it not be a dominion as is the case for canada? and would not the states of australia likewise be provinces? i honestly dont understand the differences between each of these and if someone could explain them to me it would be greatly appreciated. july utc,0

1096,legally there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the schengen area there are such criteria for joining the eu but this is a different matter. the only possibility to join the schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu which includes a clause that schengenrelated eu law would be applicable in the associated noneu state. the associated state would only have the right to be consulted. thus the u.s. would have to accept each and every majority decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. and the u.s. would have to accept that every thirdcountry national holding a residence title of a schengen state could enter the u.s. without even being checked. to bil guadeloupe and french guiana are not inside the schengen area because this would e.g. require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french guiana and suriname brasil etc. with hightech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe. i can understand why they do not invest any money into this.,0

1129, silesians andrew i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia. i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project. assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. i inquired about silesian/polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist. good luck with the article. olessi thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion. you are right that the work of a person is most important.however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace. if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up. to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist. i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition. seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german/silesian/polish guy. it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well. so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement.with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned. for some to hundred years there were under german governments. they had bad time as you possibly can imagine. many of them married with german and were/are of course confused who they are. you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued. finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. there in poland was complete disorder. soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way. “national” government just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. polish borders were shifted. we lost some % of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland. you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people. they spoke different polish dialect also. on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately i am. this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally. thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much. i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans.now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations.finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often naïve. not many realize that politic need caution. those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers. i am also convinced there exists something like national character. you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own.returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column on polish terytory in addition.sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich i still have with ge wiki. they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. that sucks.sorry and thanks again. feel free to contact me any time you need.best regards andrew december,0

1133,banging your head against a wall hi i see jayjg has been leaving messages on your page with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness. in reality jayjg is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light. along with many of his cohorts.the problem is that jayjg is part of the wikipedia cabal. when there were elections despite massive efforts to the contrary a number of people got a higher vote percentage than jayjg but jimbo wales put him on arbcom anyhow. jimbo has shown his true colors as well.these people control wikipedia. they are all together and attacking you. no one is coming to your aid. this is because they control wikipedia with jimbo at the center and have more or less driven off everyone else. you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up disorted justified etc. anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here.my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative like a wiki encyclopedia that is not prozionist and antimuslim like this one. or if you do continue here for a little bit to spend less time. it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than . eventually you will give up here everyone does. you are fighting a losing battle.,0

1172,wrong licensesi have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. the exceptions areimagewankhede on the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free creative commons licenses but failed to actually change the licensing. image concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a creative commons license as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. as such the photo may not be used on wikipedia except perhaps under fair use policy which probably doesnt apply or under panorama freedom depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic.image image description page implies that it is licensed for noncommercial use only contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia. in addition the link to the original source which could clarify which condition is correct of the image is missing.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved. image to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim the author should probably email the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.image the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons noderivative license a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia either.image no evidence of the image being under a free license.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image creative commons noderivative license.image all rights reserved.image creative commons attribution noncommercial noderivative license unacceptable on wikipedia.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image the link to the original source is missing no evidence that it is under the creative commons license.image taken from wikitravel. uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.image who made this image?there are several issues here. there are multiple creative commons licenses not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia. in particular licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and cant be used on wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy creative commons atrribution and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay. also there are multiple versions of the licenses creative commons atrribution sharealike . . . and . are all distinct licenses. the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the . versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older licenses you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. as far as i can see flickr only uses the . versions of the licenses.in addition some of the flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient either. you should ask the authors to do one of the followingchange the flickr page to license the image under creative commons attribution or attribution sharealike license apparently this would change the licensing for all images and this may not be what they intend to dopost a message to the image page with a text similar to the followingi creator of the image agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license link alternately under the creative commons attribution sharealike license link. this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.email the wikimedia foundation permissionsenatwikimediadotorg with a message similar to the above also specifying which image images the user intends to release under the license. this would be the best choice if the author doesnt want to reveal his identity on wikip,0

1177, israelipalestinian conflict protect? yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this. it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc. wiki articles i have referenced why not this one? thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints. and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict. it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus. i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic. you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased. do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source? please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous. if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers. there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise. i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks. apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page. i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on wiki saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see. repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive. protection is not an endorsement of the current version. zman the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. clearly there is something seriously wrong. as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan. worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes. if the events at this article really offend you it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk ,0

1190,how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? also just because a word has a historical meaning doesnt mean that it cant ever mean anything else as culture develops. the word rap meant to knock as on a door up until the late s for example. would you deny the more modern use of the term? the english language has no board to regulate it as french does with the lacadémie française so you have no basis for defining what the word means. we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like youre and your for example but none such for words like bukkake. if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way that is valid. my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier gay just as there is no need to call men having anal sex gay anal sex but thats really irrelevent. i think it is important to make clear the historical implications but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything but specifically semen and specifically onto a persons face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it. ,0

1235,im back. i already created id occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class c when i do i collected a massive number of diff edits on balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is on record getting blocked for saying this about greeks under a previous handle. not to mention his personal talk page is one big antigreek rant fest pointing to questionable fyrom news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titlesno assfuckers has a nice ring to it d use it as a pejorative term. i was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin futper and a few others e.g. macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antigreek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking im going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. as for the current naming disputing article... i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i dont think that reduces the existential threat to greece. communism fell years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left. there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately. i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasnt greek i didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didnt think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. assuming you see it as relevant yourself of coursefebruary the fyroms president kirov gligorov at an interview by the foreign information service daily report easten europe stated we are slavs who came to the region in the sixth century. we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians.january the fyroms ambassador in washington d.c. mrs. ljubica acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great. we are slavs and we speak a slavic language. greece is the fyroms second largest trading partner and its number one investor.february the fyrom.s ambassador to canada gyordan veselinov in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great. we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian. there is some confusion about our identity.i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior. he directly contradicts fyroms own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognitionprime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan who claims to be related to alexander the great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient macedonians. and dont get me started on that incident where gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of united macedonia was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article,0

1243,articles ive just deleted the bugrr team or however that was spelled and notice other deletion requests on other articles here. i also read your note on that articles talk page and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of wikipedia. we only allow articles on subjects that are notable generally this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple independent reliable sources. that means that a company thats just recently started that has never produced a product and that by the way those were written seem closer to a group of friends is not a suitable subject for a wp article. basically if you cant find a number of newspaper etc. articles discussing the company it shouldnt have an article. i hope this explains why these articles were deleted.in connection to this i need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type. continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators and these are clearly nonnotable companies so much so that we used the expedited speedy deletion process.,0

1258,outdent how about looking at it like this. rpg rulebooks are just that. the rulebook explains how to play the game but it is not the game itself. the isbn manual you reference below supports this games shall not be given isbns. there may be some confusion in the matter but one good example is found by harking back to ad nd ed. to play that game required it being rules heavy that really is pretty much true a minimum of two books—the dm guide and the players handbook. neither contained the game and the game went far beyond what was in either. the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books magazine articles supplements pamphlets online articles and what was in the head of the players. the book is about the game it is not the game. for that matter a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn so you cant really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn. a publisher doesnt mean its a book as board games computer games and any number of things are published and have publishers. ,0
1259,wangi said>>> who are you reswobslc or stupidcupid?well now you show yourself in your true colours for all to see. now you accuse me of being two users? you find that a worthwhile comment? now your making yourself look stupid. well donewangi said>>> im sorry if you think pointing out that in fact i didnt do something you alleged me to is a weak responseif i quote another user and then reply to that quote forgive me for making this sound simple but..% of users would know im addressing my remarks to the person being quoted. of course if your saying you weren’t sure if those were your remarks or not that you could read through a couple of paragraphs to refresh your memory as to whether you said that or not than of course its all my fault. i should have placed a foot banner saying this quote is not from wangi....maybe i should do that for every post? or maybe your saying you post as more than one user and you forgot which id you used?wangi said>>> but im getting a little pissed off here with your lack of care for facts if youre going to say i did or said something then please be careful enough to make sure i did do/say those things. well yes we see your use of the english language in all its glory once again here. if every post must specify whther its addressed at you or not i can see how frustrating it must be reading through wiki at all. wang said>>> wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a link directory and not a tourist guide makes plenty sense to me.yes it does make sense. of course you left out the context of my question which relates not to the general point of wiki but to the bias of some users you to which links they want to see. we already know you alone claimed the first link was spam and you removed it on that basis. even users who don’t think the link should have been there agreed it was not spam. so your poor judgment is not in doubt. your following days of rant showed your true reason for not wanting the link it was because you didn’t like the idea of the site also selling hotel rooms. the link to the visitor centre is still there by the way which shows it was regarded as being a legitimate item to link to. my point still remains that if its worth linking to the first link was far more useful to the general public. ,0

1267,discussion boards are almost the lowest form of life on wprs only just above comments sections on blogs. however if you can demonstrate that glf has written this and the fact that it has appeared under his name on a forum that he has moderating rights on may indicate this although he does not use a stared account which means it could be an imposter. the daily mirror account seems to be totally derivative of the guardian and the guardian does not say that glf was a member of the bnp just that their journalist contacted him and he said that he could not be active. the daily mirror could well have lost the subtelty of what the guardian said i wouldnt like to be their libel lawyer on that with all of this and knowing glfs propensity to sue i am going to cut this out. the fact that the cda is to the right of the conservative party is pretty well established in the article. ,0

1282, i was thinking about this last night and came to two conclusions first focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor if possible to global warming and denialism. dont tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous.. second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions. join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate. and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert. done the page is impregnable. take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer. using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end. barbara boxer is a politician. every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both. even more — and this is important — barabara boxer is not a runofthemill politician. it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. in short the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what? test. i intend to delete that one sometime soon too. i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thankyou to the editors who revert me every time they do so. or maybe a barnstar? i dunno some token of gratitude or other. •  ,0

1299,you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors.under wikipedia policy under the rr rule it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and/or help improve the article. there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors. that is to leave the rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page youll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion without explanation without stating their objections first without submitting their proposed changes to peer review and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreedupon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.,0

1304,neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published reliable sources. this is what you have quoted me? unfortunately that is not helpful. i appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion. my frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point. i have clearly laid out why this is not a pov piece and still not a single user has proven otherwise assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long? is that really a legitimate argument or is rjensen simply offended that i have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge.giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held view i am sorry you think i am in the minority. is the same conclusion reached by the world health organization aap cps dermatology associations worldwide and anyone who has actually objectively reviewed the literature and the tactics used by the industry. for people to say that i am in the minority perhaps in the court of public opinion but isnt that how propaganda works? there is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda this is not even open for debate. but these people are seriously compromising the integrity of this website by acting like gods claiming they know more about propaganda than i based on health information and an industry that they dont fully understand. i can by the way generalize about the industry as it is represented by the jcta which is the organization i cite in the article. on what basis cna they do this i ask all of them? and they suddenly become sensitive and cite wp ... and claim i am the one who is personally attacking them?,0

1404,re your ae topic ban appealsorry but it strains credulity mine anyway to believe that you didnt realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are wellacquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save as you state here . recent article/talk page history . you havent edited the article since and you must have thousands of other articles that need improvement on your watchlist. you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard re this as you have for many articles during the past few months.in my view the a.m. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcomingness. the remainder of the appeal in which you speak of wps losses from your lack of participation thats a different story that others can think over. if you remove the a.m. section i shant contest your appeal since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesnt make much difference in the long run. but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. you could either remove that section since it hasnt been commented on there yet or strike it. if you choose not to do either i may bring it up at the ae appeal. id prefer that we keep the conversation here but if youd rather have it on my talk page thats ok by me if so ill post talkbacks.,0

1412,deleted response to comments on wikipedia talkwikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. in this particular case the discussion was started by user brad who made a personal comment about me. now i dont mind this i was more curious than offended but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talknaming conventions ships‎. you claimed that my post which you deleted was a pov inserted into a neutral notice. it may have been a pov about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable. it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting. if you are going to start censoring postings then i would suggest you do so impartially. you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice but merely removed one comment. rather than restoring impartiality this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.far better that you do not delete anyones comments. i would suggest reading wikipediano personal attacks. im not sure what deleting others posts comes under try wikipediaetiquette.,0

1428,pretty much what i said the first day this was posted. now i have neither a problem with the cabals decision nor in the cabals logic as deamon does. my concern is why a vote that basically said i dont know means it stays at burma. by the cabals conclusion...if the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation and we had the same cabal it would now be a myanmar article. i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy. however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision? you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma. husond is right where does this end? when i first looked at this mess i said and posted that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. there are good points for each argument. im in the burma camp but that is how i see things. so im looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. choice just doesnt look that appealing. ,0

1459,with respect you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. getting off the subject a little but it does have some relevance the nz herald routinely refers to nzers of european descent as pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. of course i would not include this in any article and defintely not this one without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of hits for rooster found in nz media. many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry. clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the countrys readership than poultry.just stating both cockerel and rooster are used is factual whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.also i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both cockerel or rooster are common.,0

1463, summary of the afd debate negative votes delete the original editor was userivygohnair so it was marked as a vanity article for violating wpauto. mapetite strong delete ignorance of the rules is not a valid argument for keeping an article. vyse neutral positive votes procedural nomination. speedy a was applied but was contested and this warrants a further look. im neutral for now even though this article doesnt seem to be. colourburst comment/questioncsd a is unremarkable people groups companies and websites.. is that the reason for the afd too? according to wikipediavanityguidelines as explained below an authors conflict of interest by itself is not a basis for deletion but lack of assertion of notability is. edward wakelin it is true that i have come into the fray to defend ivy goh nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me. i think if you want to apply the vanity label because one person edits the other and vice versa it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit. both userivygohnair and userchandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed ie singapore literature and writing secondly it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names if this had been the case the problem wouldnt have arisen. therefore i think there is much merit in user edward wakelin remarks above and that an authors conflict of interest is by itself not a basis for deletion. out by wikipedia. chandrannair talk • contribs . comment lets be nice to newcomers as per wikipediaplease do not bite the newcomers. this seems like a case where newcomers not knowing the rules here. an author of bestseller may be notable enough to get an article in an encyclopedia. perhaps this biography needs some fixing as per wikipediabiographies of living persons. deleting is probably unnecessary. pfhlai i have read her book though im not from singapore and its better than a lot of the stuff that makes it to the ny times best seller list. —the preceding unsigned comment was added by ... talk • contribs. –new to all this in wikipedia... i think the mood to delete is harsh. this is a user who seems to have made a definite impact in a small place and is trying to popularise the creative energies of singapore. let us be more forgiving besides it looks there is actual published reviews as testament to the work. mcporpington mcporpington sorry i meant to add to my comment above that the article should not be deleted mcporpington mcporpington hi i am saddened to read such biting petty comments and suggestions about deleting this article. this person has clearly contributed to singapore literature and has also been cited by others. signed phillygal i did my military service in singapore and i love the country. i vote to keep. i do not see any conflict of interest herejeanlouis retrieved from ,0
1464,yes lets berate the new editor with no experience and no idea by then relegating their arguments to a version of wpown. nice to have a comment that violates own and civil in one fell swoop while also stating theyre on a path to nowhere hence showing every reference to consensus was a sham because despite your claims of arguing with me being pointless you have admitted to have no interest at all to bringing the article in lines with wikipedia standards because hey its your article. –– talk ,0

1477,but getting rid of the white stolen generation but keeping the stolen generations name is extremely hypocritical. the only reason the aboriginal stolen generation is widely used is because it is widely known. very few people know about the white stolen generations that doesnt mean it is less valid it just means it is less known in the mainstream public.the stolen generations was where aboriginal children were taken from their families and put into foster care or adopted.the white stolen generations was where white children were taken from their families and put into slave camps or adopted.now you tell me how the white stolen generations is any less valid than the stolen generations? they were exactly the same why cant you accept that?,0

1490,janettedoe i appreciate your finding and uploading the rao articles. however this can easily become an endless discussion. for some other yadavapologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than rao and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the yadav apologists are not and have no intention aware or unaware of being—will go scurrying again for the article. after that we all will try to interpret it weighing the pros and cons again to a degree the apologists will not for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path. i think we cant make the determination of whether rao applies here or not at least not yet. let the secondary sources do that. we need to rely on recent scholarship especially that in textbooks published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds. two such books by susan bayly and christophe jaffrelot both widely used in universities around the world both reviewed extensively in the literature are being used in the article. let the article writing or rewriting proceed based on these or similar books. once the article has been fleshed out we can come back to the issue of rao. otherwise nothing will get done and those of us whove taken time out from our other wikipedia not to speak rl pursuits to attend to the article will slowly walk away out of touch and out of sympathy. «talk» ,0

1495,rsa labss now emc mit and acm are wrong? vquaker. i am used to accepting correction when it is due but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source rsa labs on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing. i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know it must be spurious. some people know that its better to get their legal information from government sources not wikipedia. if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide exposition or sanctioned resource then i believe the u.s. government would like to hear your ideas. further someone you know or knows you is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance. needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat. though i suspect you know this already. im not offended though just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard. i would ask you this if a user loses their smartcard i.e. cac and forgets their password with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person? there are organizations that will terminate you but i couldnt have said that in my expounding of the th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge. when we set out it was to provide reliable information if the mission has changed well who could tell? consider me a noncontributor from now onwe arent allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work it is an anathema. say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. i should expect nothing less after all i teach. what changed the tone was your dumbingdown and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone. smell? nonsequitur. you gave me things to read but im still waiting for you to cite wikipedias policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister. i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style organization and applicability be inline with one or more regulatory bodies?now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases do you have access to them elsevier jstor edas ieee springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them youre stuck in a google funk but i digress are full of references to fourth factor. that cash register key the manager uses when you return something yep someone you know. an thats been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful. i just didnt realize you alone set these standards. i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly. ,0

1516, organisations also count as things. the section you quote from wpname is in the section titled use english words which goes on to say sometimes the usual english version will differ somewhat from the local form as in franz josef strauss and rarely as with mount everest it will be completely different. this is clearly a case where the usual english version differs somewhat. wikipedianaming conventions political parties carries several exceptions the third exception is parties whose name is more commonly known by acronyms than their full name in international newsmedia. since gpv is more commonly known by its acronym this naming convention does not apply. there is no problem with ambiguity since there are no other topics in wikipedia that carry the name gpv. even if there were this article would then be named gpv political party to disambiguate them.in conclusion please read naming conventions in full before quoting them to me. also please demonstrate that gpv is not the most commonly used name in english for this party which you have not yet done. thank you. ,0
1517,tangential forces the tangential forces coriolis and euler can be applied to a system but they dont occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism but that is off topic.during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two.we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like. the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained corotating radial motion.in a rotating frame of reference with nonuniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially.in a keplerian orbit there will be zero tangential acceleration although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force.having said all this tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. the centrifugal force is an outward radial force.more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the radial distance variable.they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.,0

1519,yes youre right theologically catholicism is very different to american protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want. sure they use the teleological argument but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isnt pseudoscience which is what irks me as a scientist. but i dont understand theology probably because ive been trained to think too scientifically. and the catholic church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues. but catholics are really into authority so what the hierarchy says goes. — dunc☺,0

1565,thank you for this but if i understand correctly you are assuming that the force is proportional to the magnitude of the apparent wind. but the total force on the sails is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the apparent wind so the forward force depends on the angle and on the square of the magnitude. that is the relation that i used for the degree table above. but maybe i misundertand your formulas and your table.,0
1566,a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies phylogenies i.e. dictomously branching processes are processes that involve things that is objects and as such have to be modeled by objectoriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria. now as an objectoriented model the model actually represents two consecutive objects i.e. two objects in a row by each of its internal lines i.e. lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node the former belonging to the category i.e. concept objects after nodes and the latter to the category objects before nodes. if the model includes all objects of a certain category then both of these make up this category. in summary phylogenies consist of two categories i.e. concepts of objects objects before nodes and objects after nodes and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category then these two categories make up this category.cladistics or cladism as i prefer to call it confuses the concept objects after nodes with the concept objects before nodes by defining lines between nodes as single things thereby confusing category with object that is kind with thing thus confusing conceptualization itself. the approach is actually a return to a prescientific stage this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. if this approach could ever be proved to be correct then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. luckily einsteins discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach i.e. claim and this it did even before the approach was born. cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged. consist presently at ... ,0
1567,hi how are you today? ive been looking over your fetal alcohol work and its pretty sharp. my dads a doc and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that he looked at it too. good work.so yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy. im not looking to out anyone or anyhting its just gotten to the point that well i think theres a reason and other people too to read about this fascinating community activist. i was telling will beback ive been a memebr of sierra club since i was akid my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life and ive done the same wiht my own children. its a cool way to move things forward like that movie but hoefulyl much less trite. anyhow.. whats the good word with you today? i think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog punching in before they set out to undermine one another. because thats whats happening here im actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. look over at biff rose there was a flargrant violation of the rr standard and i pointed out that to will beback that each time i made that violation i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know ive got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip to follow up on as i told will you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you cant just block an article because true information is being disseminated through it. well you can but its against the wiki rules and so you are in violation though i dont really think you care anyhow hope you keep your head above water and il lsee you at the fights so to speak. have a good day ill remain civil as long as you do.. but you ve got to remain civil in your actions too ok? ok.,0
1568,your source states about the black–white difference in iq which at the time was about points the neisser et al. article stated there is not much direct evidence on this point but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis. that conclusion stands today there has been no new direct evidence on the question. see rushton jensen a b gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black–white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.please stop lying. ... then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no. do you see the problem here? ... question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view? the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars. yes. ... question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist? the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology. the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article. no. nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having virtually no chance of being true by a reliable tertiary source. ... ,0

1638,untitledalso see infobox vote codes and minor state please stop since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there. is algeria minor? iran? its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted. as for making ma a country code for western sahara its not. ma is a code for morocco and so it is in moroccos infobox. eh was created for western sahara so that is its country code. as far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the united nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places. ❤t☮c☺m☯ it does not need a definition to be in the article. a minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council ... etc. as to the eh domain it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for ws but it is not assigned .ma being the one used in the territory. the same thing applies for the currency the mad is the currency of morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. the same thing goes for the iac the time zone + utc etc. they are the ones used in the territory. these things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. as to your ridiculous claim of the un considering the territory as occupied i already explained to you the difference between a un position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in of the algeriancuban drafted document that has no obligation on the un. the zionism=racism example is the brightest one for you to understand it. i will revert to the version that was in use before the anon ip started this mess. it does since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense. what states that .ma is being used in the territory? do you have any evidence of this at all? the same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. to ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards. western sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states im not going through this with you again. ❤t☮c☺m☯ ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. minor states is indeed a value judgement although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena algeria is not a big newsmaker per se. but in the interest of neutrality merely noting african asian and latin american states seems reasonable. at the same time if koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. same standards on language. evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in western sahara provinces using .ma. it is trivially easy to find that. koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding. what is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in western sahara? « d. trebbien talk may utc good question. since effectively all internet service to the western sahara is via maroc telecom or other moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in moroccan territory exws provinces largely in the casarabat area. technically i am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service. presumably the regional investment office of laayoune may have its server physically in laayoune. other similar offices may also. it strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the moroccan address .ma. polisario partisans may not like that but its effective reality. country codes i find it reasonable th,0

1651,sock puppetry? is using any account whatsoever considered sock puppetry? this site is a complete joke. i cant even edit using a verifiable account without being accused of violating some concocted offense. my address was censored because i was using an account which was apparently improperly named so i am now using one that is properly named after the probation period and that in and of itself is apparently an offense. logically what is going on is that i am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because i am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance. what kind of site are you people trying to run here? its no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when its become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. i have continuously been censored for editing a biased article an article which is continuously edited by selfavowed marxists and antizionists the very same people whose pov the article unashamedly puts forward. what kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? if any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication but its quite apparent that wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. there is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. in short explain yourselves particularly roland rance who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with all without explaining why. when you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility. as it stands wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence.,0

1677,mario party is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for nintendo platforms featuring popular nintendo characters. it was released on the nintendo gamecube in north america on october strangely before the japanese release on november . it was released on november in europe being heavily criticised for being nintendos big gamecube game for christmas as metroid prime was delayed until march .mario party was the first mario party that was released on the nintendo gamecube. each board had its own host including toad goomba shy guy koopa and boo. mario party also contains some characters new to the franchise thwomp and whomp. klepto dolphin lakitu and star along with two completely new characters named genie of the lamp and ztar are included as well. mario party retains the story mode found in mario party .the game as usual contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board trying to collect as many stars as possible. the star space would appear randomly on the board and players would have to reach it before anyone else. however the stars carry a price tag of coins and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames which take place at the end of each turn after all the players have rolled the dice block which will always roll a number from one to ten.battle minigames are like the player games but generally with many exceptions a little more elaborate. battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins from into a pot. first place gets % of the pot second place gets % and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. every mario party contains to minigames of a few different types. fourplayer games are a freeforall in which all players compete against each other. on and on minigames put players in groups so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win even though they are against each other in the main game. in most situations winners of these games make coins each.a new addition to the mario party series was the bowser minigames. players play in a very elaborate minigame that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. see bowser minigame section below the loser loses a prespecified item usually coins or items.gameplayboards toads midway madness goombas greedy gala koopas seaside soiree shy guys jungle jam boos haunted bash bowsers gnarly party clear story mode to unlock itspacesthere is various spaces you can land in the game. the following is a list of them and what they do.blue space you get three coins. also there is a special feature on this game called hidden blocks in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.red space you lose three coins.green happening space a special board event takes place.warp space you are sent to the same space as an opponent. a spinner chooses which opponents space you will warp to.mushroom space two boxes will appear one big and one small. choose one and you will be given either a mini mushroom or a mega mushroom. note the mega mushroom is not always in the large box and the mini mushroom is not always in the small box.battle space a battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. the better you finish in the minigame the more coins you will get back from the pot.bowser space bowser may steal items from players or a bowser minigame may begin.fortune space a reversal of fortune begins in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. the player who landed,0

1695, hie dvdm. i was writing what follows while you made your edit. i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example.thanks johnuniq for your advice and input. concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s early s. adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats. but thats not the really important issue here. the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there. btw in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out. at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved. there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for. cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place. throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute. so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length. ,0

1715,firstly some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts? also the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said. perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant. perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily. i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia but i also exploited loop holes in the rules. so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning. and im so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page. you asked that we do something i.e. explain the significance of the clan etc and we did but you deleted it anyway. and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us. also one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that? if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth? also if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right? if you say no then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit. before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. ,0

1720,elellandhello humusi am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot. i m very inexperienced with wikipedia. i was enthralled by wikipedia. initially. that is until i met eleland. i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland. eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted. he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.the article was on ed oloughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent. the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. he was amongst the candidates for this years dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.so i studied eleland a little.ive looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict. more than were directly antiisrael. his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the proisrael side. in this way he has undermined many many articles.personally i dont care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc. i think there is a problem.wikipedia is i am afraid beginning to read like eleland wrote the script.who is eleland? what power does he actually have?can anything be done?adon emmetif you post a reply here i will contact here or even by email,0

1756, misleading reference to study? in the section on lead paint in art which i largely wrote someone added the followinglead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids often from fingerprints. as a result many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited. their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that wasnt absolutely clear. but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle dont usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections. and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artists paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead. normally flake white is used only by oil painters and theres no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. cooperstown is a wellrespected institution but as of now im sticking with the classic ralph mayer. flake white may get slightly yellowish after centuries but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. if someone has more information on this please mention it here otherwise when i come back im going to delete that paragraph or water it down no pun intended.,0
1757,thats my point. i looked for false positives or any feature that would distinguish these accounts and there was none to be found. the unpleasant situation is that we had a user with a history of exactly this sort of problem with a set of circumstances reported by users in good standing that exactly matched sock puppetry. i had to make a difficult judgment call per all the available information and the conclusion was a finding of sock puppetry. i have invited checkusers and others to review the report. everything is available for inspection and comment. talk,0
1758,did you even look at my edit before reverting it? i did change it up as you wanted to say that rex thinks it doesnt work. and as you said it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article making it perfect for the lead. just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesnt mean we can also use this source. the more sources the better. i would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldnt be added. as i know all too well how this works no one touches it in order to finish this dispute and then the person who didnt want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won. and then revert whenever the page gets changed.,0

1765,there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white. users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view cited sources or not its obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong. i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what .% of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this .% obviously not including alun slrubenstein. when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another. all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke. you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist. so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a white person is just do us all a favor and either delete this article since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you get over it and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesnt scientifically exist. /end commafest ,0

1769,ive traced the origin of one of the disputed sentences myself. it seems the problem stems from multiple users whose first language is not english who dont understand the need for sources and who cant edit in accordance with wpnpov. at july adds ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out the problem of french language. pov poor english unsourced and meaningless whats the problem with the french language that causes problems for mathematicians? some of the worlds best mathematicians are french.at august who seems to be french changes it to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity. pov poor english unencyclopedic insulting unsourced.at august changes it to ishihara then apologized by stating his apreciation for the french culture. unsourced and contains a spelling mistake possibly just a typo.at august userhmib reverts to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity. see above.perhaps the dispute between foc and hmib could be reduced if you were both to supply sources for every edit thats likely to be challenged. also please bear in mind that this is the english wikipedia and edits must conform to a minimal standard of english. this is especially true when the edits are contentious and are leading to weekslong edit wars. im leaving this on focs page too. talk august utc,0
1770,addressingwhile indian tribe is official us govt lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur dalene people once inhabited acres ha in northern idaho and washington and montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur dalene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties idaho. you dont have to use my wording but you see how i am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined. .  boomer second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. id put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway? keep the chronology clearer. interesting that the coeur dalene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm from a very cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter. the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case.,0

1776, pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offlinehiim not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous.does this mean i hadnt registered? i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have. i always use my real name in signatures.and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link.thanksdennis bathorykitszbathorybathorythanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear. whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name. i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w. bush at least if its not already taken. wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently. all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself. thats what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym. it is not independently verified against some external identity database. and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia. we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials.by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathorykitzs. that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system. such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you. that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia. when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit. users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia. but those are all manual checks. there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.likewise no one can inherently trust the email address. the way internet domains are set up anyone could register and create any email name they wanted. like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority. and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.most people are honest. but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not. thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security. the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours. how can a bank know that youre really you? and how far can that trust be extended? under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable? how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible. unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate. anyway ill get off my soapbox now. thanks for your message.to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia. the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top. that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols. you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages. you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes . when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp.again welcome to wikipedia. talk ,0

1787,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory. it cant because langan is not a member of academia. but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable. for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions.byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. this is correct. to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions. however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral. unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal. he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself. by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu. this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well. oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously. ,0

1794, september utcill try to take the points in turn. hope i get this format right. wpblpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. i am not sure how the section applies if you could be more clear it would be helpful. the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. by this metric so little can be used that its almost meaningless. someone stating their birthdate or the grade school they attended. but for a person saying i have a conflict with jenny smith over issue x where do we draw the line? it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing with one placing on their personal publicist website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldnt argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. one can take things too far and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. ... ,0

1813,mr. ... i dont mean to be frank but your title does assert that so is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such the majority of the world still see it as a part of georgia after all it was and is a civilwar. on top of that south ossetians abkahzians are russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the russian federation. this is also the problem logically to call it as such is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms its existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of? it is for the most part still the georgian region its more to do with logic then pov. my friend mr ... im trying front with you whatsoever but that statement so war doesnt make sense to me. however i think that the solution is probably like pubkjre said in regards to the vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a pov and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldnt do good every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how im going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to i am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that summation i second pubkjre we should have a etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why.,0

1815,whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation. in this case organic remains was added to explain the word they. while w used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils. from the dictionary of geologic terms rd edition by bates and johnson fossil any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time. nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time. and further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.w likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this wp page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future. it is unfortunate that w were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as misunderstand and twist what they said.as much impact as w have had on creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood is now way out of date. modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood. when critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism. ,0

1818, question sarah there is something that ive wondered about for a long time that is related to coi editing. one need look no further than my user page where i quote chris hedges they control our systems of information. and add surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporateapproved encyclopedia. at a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easilyled lamebrained losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy. what if anything is presently being done? im aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to prove that he had no coi related to the articles he edits and ive heard of this incident dozens of times since where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest. many times ive wondered how wikipedia went about finding this socalled proof. if i put myself in a position in which i was editing for pay but denied it how could it be proven that i was? i mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have wp give him/her the wp stamp of approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please. they can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check. ,0

1848,my c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a criticisms section. then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground. for the record i completely agree % that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders just as good if not better that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain task force that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches tth migraine cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin and inconclusive and controversial for nonmusculoskeletal disorders. part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for lbp. this is the most succint and precise summary there is. we can toss the reference in and call it a day. a majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence both in research and rd parties governments favours chiropractic care. we cant let ernst conclusions which have been rebutted and invalidated skew what is now generally accepted. notice the terms too generally etc.,0

1893,this entry was deleted by its author owing to the fact that it contains research which is being distorted somewhat. since its a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist ive decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic. thus the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations distortions etc is to remove it. since you have decided to continue this antagonization i am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at wikipedia. of course you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the havana shipyards however ive decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article. use of any of the above by persons other than the author without his permission is in violation of international copyright standards and will be promplty reported to the fcc federal communications commission and all other pertinent authorities.,0

1900,i think that the infobox should at least have a picture of muhammad if there is to be one anywhere. the image for the page on muhammad should be a depiction of muhammad. having calligraphy or symbolism replace an actual picture would not be in the spirit of wikipedia. regrettably it will offend some people but that is not nor should be the impetus behind any decision. a picture of muhammad would be more encyclopedic and offer more knowledge therefore it is the only real option if this is to remain a truly neutral place to obtain knowledge. also i feel like there is an overabundance of images in this article. lots of images of redundant or mildly irrelevant things as if people are unconsciously putting in different images because they feel bad about putting in an image of muhammad.,0

1914, colorado balloon incident greetings. i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon. unfortunately wikipedias use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts. its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia. refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article. wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents. the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. ive been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.i hope i havent given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as i do especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. thanks for your contributions ,0
1915, this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x for the following reasons. should sort amd or intel implementations as x? generally x was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa might or might name themselves with such as cyrix x intel pentium and so on. amds long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together. nowadays software labeled themselves as x are ia compatible software and use x or x differentiating with it. so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. . generations? what is the th generation x processor? who invented this kinda processors? amd k just says that it succeeds amd k rather than saying it is the th x processor and ive never heard intel call their x processors exceeding the th generation. and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the th x processor succeeding pentium iii but none confirmed this. so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and efficeon if the morph firmed on the system board implements x decoder call themselves as x processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor? at this situation what kind of processor is it? ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the th/th generation x? who is another jane austen making up another northanger abbey?. x is one architectureisa name? what such a ridiculous thing that ive ever heard on earth x is used to referring the processor a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. if it were the name of an architecture then in this logic way intel is one of the implementation of this architecture? ,0
1916,amcom article hiearlier today i noticed that there is no article on amcom and i posted on the amnet talk page before moving it to talkamcom because although the network is called amnet the actual company is called amcom.i didnt realize until later that there was already an amcom actually amnet page that had been deleted. after reading the explanation for the deletion im not sure whether amcom really has enough notability or not. however if we do want to make an amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the companys notability.if you are still interested take a look at this article i found if you want to reply to me make sure you either reply on my talk page or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. otherwise i wont know that youve replied.welcome and good luck,0

1947,when you look at it in the clear light of day this is an argument in which both sides are doing the same things and making the same counteraccusations. it has been resolved to date by the fact that one side of the argument have the power. but might doesnt make right. who actually started the unreasonable behaviour? perhaps the wikipedian who seemed to make the rather ambiguous statement in which he said that the holocaust talk page is not there for discussion. well it is there for discussion thats what a talk page is. if he meant it is not there for irrelevant discussion he should have stated that explicitly and that having been done be prepared to demonstrate that to anyone who might be in doubt on the matter....,0

1973,i support the idea of wikicode. basically i think we should present code in a pythonlike language that doesnt carry so much baggage. for example we can use english sentences or sentence fragments instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure python library. further python has the baggage that there are no blockterminators i.e. no } or ends or fis or repeats. by adding such terminators we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers. in otherwords were basically right on track removing the quirks of python and making it higherlevel. so i support the idea myself. dec utc,0

2029,undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. see archive . the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign . hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. the relationship if one can call it that between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright. many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but obamawrighttucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life. if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article. there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also. picking out just hagee to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight. this article is about mccains whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant. if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about mccains campaign which has a couple paragraphs about hagee. in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut. right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on mccainfeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s as compared to more about hagee.,0

2032,animation there is something very unique about south of the style of animation it is actually possible to have an episode of south park in an .svg animation which is a file format that allows for unlimited upconversion of images and animation but only in a way of simple shapesand since south park is already a somewhat brick style animation you could theoretically upconvert it to high definition using the .svg format and it would look just like that was the normal resolution.,0

2035,alex thank you for your reply.i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion.regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat. that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later. there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page.the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland. it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion. and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine. note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep. i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system. 連絡 見学/迷惑 ,0
2036,i found a better reference.in page theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women. of these only the first is common.and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous and per cent for monogamous unions.the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either. this had been sitting on the shelf for over years deep in the recesses of the basement. murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.,0

2086,further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede . since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards. sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it. ,0

2111,hmmm. i was actually writing a response as you sent yours. oh well. for the record my response was thisresurrecting articles is frowned upon yes. we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change to...the game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article.making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders. certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start. i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article i.e. not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works. if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan. i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same. i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though. the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as – manchester city f.c. season/spurs city or however the subpage is actually named given the / in the name.yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category. i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic. better to do it ourselves i guess.sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and...well better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed. hopefully i addressed all your points. ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak. having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in. generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy. yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play. to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup? in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it. talk ,0

2139, july utcalthough i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine. i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so. not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles. nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles. however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now. at some point however i will source his/her statements as soon as i find time to delve into the texts just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you. until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this. the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth. but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail. from wikipedia re. abbey road being the final album or notabbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles. although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded. ...after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days. .. just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album. martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be. in their interviews for the beatles anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note.re. the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road but it is followed by her majesty. in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on july her majesty followed mean mr. mustard......etc. this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people. ,0

2148,at bat edit warring at matt joyce baseball juan encarnación terry tiffee ian kinsler craig breslow matt guerrier etc.==please dont change at bat to atbat. atbat just redirects right back to at bat anyway. i agree. i agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated. in addition pls stop edit warring at matt joyce baseball ian kinsler craig breslow etc. and add to the list matt guerrier. it is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record. there is no reason to delete it other than your penchant for disruptive edits. kindly desist. it has also been explained to you with proper citations that the plural of rbi is rbis. pls stop edit warring this point. see juan encarnación and terry tiffee. that is vandalism. run batted in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis. obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info.its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  t / c danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap. both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler either make it a subhed or take it off seriously.oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky. in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in. rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint.either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. jackal again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch. as to rbis as xlee pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseball/archiverbis. plus is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention. yet jackals reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s as though the s is incorrect. he has done the same with at bat which he insists must be hyphenated. etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits. it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits. if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits. there is enough good work he could perform instead. well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do . as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one. regarding what uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue. in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists. allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked. jargon overrides grammar. to say that a batter flied out is probably not good grammar either but its proper baseball terminology. i think this needs to be discussed at the project page assuming anyones watching that page anymore. userbaseball,0

2152, legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. the source reads the european union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. lets have a look at the law itself. framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences ... public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group. in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case. whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal. as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredis the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court? ,0

2207,negatively biased articlethe following was entered into the article text in these edits by ... whomever wrote this wikipedia information has a clear bias and is absolutely against dr. albert rivera. in this biograpgy he is promptly attacked as a fraud before and after stating the life of dr. alberto. the refrences of public magazines where dr. rivera is pointed as a fraud are commentary opinionated and are not mere fact. it is clear that dr. riveras life is quite controversial and to discredit him is the easiet form to invalidate his claims. out of evident knowledge dr. alberto was not anticatholic he only spoke what he lived. it would be quite contradicting to have been not only a roman catholic but a jesuite and then be margined as anticatholic. obviously this would be the best label in order for catholics to reject and discard whatever dr. rivera has said.,0

2234,matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title. witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics ashkenazi hebrew cantonese linguistics american english sephardi hebrew etc etc... arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or arvanitika language are out of the question. i dont want to use arvanitika albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title. therefore the only options are arvanitic or arvanitika. they can and should be used. arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used. what is wrong with it? it is neutral. it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica etc aree wrong. macedonian and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect. if britannica or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such. no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. why should they be treated as such. every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title. arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies. what unesco britannica etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor. i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will. are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english? no so stop that straw man argument. arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy. the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia. we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them. regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies? that is what you are asking me to do,0

2298, utcas a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers. swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here. i can well understand how fennoswedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin. august ,0

2324,hi . i like the diagram but i believe that the terminal station should be in normal text because it is where the train is ultimately heading toward. similarly the next stop should be in small text because it is just a station on the wayside on the trains journey toward the last stop except in the penultimate stations of each line where the word terminus shows that the next stop is the terminus. in the layouts that were originally written for the taipei metro and guangzhou metro the terminal was placed before the next stop so i had based the nycarea railroad layouts on the taipei/guangzhou layouts. ,0

2329,hello deacon thanks for the kind words. your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar? but theres no great preference here either way.oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the th century ... have a look at the skene reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way.it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony. northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly mercia and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones. im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons.the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article. regards ,0

2331, deletion of dave warwak page wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on dave warwak an educator of vegan practices and animal rights. i see that your comment on the reason for deletion was the only thing he is known for is being fired however that is not the case in the animal friendly vegetarian vegan community. in fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food. why would you find it so crucial to speedy delete a page that simply speaks of cruelty free living and aims to educate people on the truth about their food? is that information threatening to wikipedia for some reason? and i wouldnt think as a wiki admin that your opinion on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted. you may know mr. warwak as only being fired but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition. please show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page.,0
2332,troublesome sentencepaleolithic europeans seem to have been a homogenous population possibly due to a population bottleneck or nearextinction event on the iberian peninsula where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation and then expanded into europe during the mesolithic periodthis is false. i cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that palaeolithic europe was genetically homogeneous. if there is one it would require inline citation. i think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. the studies have rather shown that mesolithic europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. the bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.,0

2394, european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not .as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version. now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable. i contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she thinks it is the most neutral one. i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the eu. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included. i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages. ,0

2402,a poor start sorry. the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. first of all no common twonations table is possible patent nonsense. second i object the followingthe passage from the russian table speaking of the kievan rus. as someone suggested earlier that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between kievan rus and modern russia. this is the main disputed claim commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian usersregardless of any ukrainian military table none of them may include the red army. this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states with very formal postwwii exception but also significantly antiukrainian. for instance red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and antisoviet guerillas. creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users. for instance see earlier alexpus passage on trading the truthgiven all that id suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising. i thank you an innocent editor for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue. ,0
2403,an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the passover holiday. the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover according to tradition.some jews currently live in iran. the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years. while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. so seems to be the way to go. ,0

2417,==irving literary society cornell university==deletionism and inclusionism in wikipedianeutral point of view third party review wikiproject new york posting transferred from user pagehi cmagha i never saw the original afd discussion but i think the article looks like the start of something fantastic my only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from cornell specific sources i.e. cornell daily sun cornell era cornell register etc.... college/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within wpn when dealing with a campus organization as some may not consider these to be independent of the subject. that being said we arent dealing with a fly by night college band that played at moonshadows and had a writeup in the ithacan this is a literary society almost as old as cornell university itself and has had significance well beyond east hill. despite the large number of cu oriented sources which i personally believe are independent you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another afd if need be. id post what you have now and keep looking for more says you says two wow great work. sorry ive been out of the loop. double smiley face from the syracuse orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality. think the critics need to read the article from a distance this is hardly promotional when you think about it. it is basically saying that cornell university had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity and tanked. we obviously would not have done that at su. i do think there is a sumner cite out there to that cmagha missed. will look for it. wiptransferred from user pageoversaw your preparations at . since others may communicate here now and again you may want to move your editorial notes to a user subpage like talk thanks for the tip very hard to learn lots of the intricacies of the wikiworld. i stll have some prep to do before asking the administrator to move that article over there are two editors in particular who are still a little raw on the article and the administrator while fair and neutral has been tough. guidance from administtrator october just reviewed the irving article again. notability addressed in the first seven footnotes. will move it back into the mainspace unless you have additional concerns.... i think its ready to go also see on cmaghas user page that others have reviewed it positively. what are the remaining objections and how do we appeal if there are still objections? here is the page spartaz if you need a refresher take it to drv please. humbug administrator guidance to editor july copied from spartaz user pagethe irving article has been noticed on the wikiproject new york page some helpful comments sent back. did not receive notice on your g decision we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly. thanks for the aid. no. unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isnt going back into mainspace. humbug material for spartaz to review prior to deciding whether to move article to mainspace july comparators in order of less to more evidence sphinx senior society notability based incredibly on primary,0
2418,i fully agree with recommending the image for deletion especially in light of the dubious claims as to its authenticity. while his hair does have some natural wave it is nowhere near that long or curlyto say nothing of the clear differences in face shape length width and symmetry. some of the first image results on a google search are t.r. with longer/wavy hair and there is no resemblance to the individual in the picture being debated. in terms of specific detailsyouve claimed this is a recent picture from t.r.s breaka date that the picture was taken would be a good start.,0

2420, more description of location please? hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is? i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful. i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. what do you think? any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful. i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you. thanks and best wishes ,0

2422,automatic protection for main page? it would be straightforward to write a bot that protected all images on the main page adding templatemprotected and unprotected all images with templatemprotected that no longer appeared on the main page. feature would be genuinely useful and save editors work. however if editors came to rely on feature then that would introduce a risk because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. a clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. and worse the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image. i suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become. may utc,0

2436,changes to this page open discussion ==since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a démenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris. i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors. i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page. i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there. this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved.the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page. the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window. the same for paris history or paris fashion. here i am but repeating what i have already written below.in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages. my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own. this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity. my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own. just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have. with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt. in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary. please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all. addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here > please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out== ,0
2437,after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in the angloirish physicist g. johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity. he was able to estimate the value of the charge e of a monovalent ion by means of faradays laws of electrolysis. this means that chemistry is part of the definitio if the electron. the value of charge was equated to faradays laws of electrolysis. there should be an section in the electron article on chemistry. and if your going to mention obscure virtual electrons why not mention chrystal fields because that is fundamental to chemistry. if your going to mention quantum physics why cant you mention quantum chemsitry because i think chemistry is just as important to physics if not more important. and i think there should be a section on electrolysis.,0

2451,official christian death ® this page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish which simply need changing and then leaving alone.i have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which i wish to place on here knowing full well that minutes later the fools that wish to write things they know little about or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become cd will desperately alter the content. the article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts. people that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them. but the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow. rd party discussion regarding valor or rozz should be eliminated in favour of the christian death biography.message me at to have discussion about page.article i propose is thus text only i will alter the page to format correctly and alter the main page add feedback to this after my discussion in thread called editing talkchristian death® comment not inside this.christian deathbiographydiscography in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth. then christian death turned it upside down.historyofficially there have been over musicians involved with the band. therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.formed in los angeles and fronted by year old vocalist/lyricist rozz williams the band released the first album “only theatre of pain in . a dark sinister style of punk rock. the album gained local success. a year later the band completely broke upsinger rozz then joined the band “pompeii founded by singer guitarist song writer valor.rozz took over vocals leaving valor to focus on guitar. before rozz joined pompeii the band had already released their fist album “look at yourself” to much acclaim which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. the pompeii had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their french record company to merge pompeii into a new version of christian death which after some debate was agreed upon. thus began the new christian death and the first pompeii tour became the first christian death tour.part way through the tour the band stopped in wales to record songs some of which were originally intended for the next pompeii album. the fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “catastrophe ballet”.like the first pompeii album catastrophe ballet had an apocalyptic theme however the music morphed into something not quite pompeii and nothing like the first christian death album. after the tour the band returned to la to later record the rd christian death album”ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. after confirming the nd tour in singer rozz quit the band. valor returned to vocals the band embarked on the nd tour. in italy the band recorded the mini album “the wind kissed pictures” a surrealist view of a mystical past. almost immediately work began on the th full length album “atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of world war ii and the connection to future shock waves. while continuously touring in the band released the th and now classic album “the scriptures” the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today. brought us the release of “sex drugs jesus christ”. this was turning point for the band. the cover depicted an image of jesus shooting up heroin. this was a full frontal attack by valor against the church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized christianity. the band then found themselves confronted by protesters riots and bomb threats these events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of nine inch nails korn marilyn manson type o negative every goth band on the planet and many others. saw the release of the double album epic “all the love all the hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death day and night man and woman black and white.in came the release of “insanus ultio proditio misericordiaque” with its theme of an ancient dream state.late in after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting christian death rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in los angels under the name christian death. on the same day christian death was in europe performing in paris france. assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash as explained to valor,0

2470,the very long discussion over st wpscn project talk page i have read a lot of the wpscn pages and the very few have neutrality tags. some have or tags but the majority seem to be npov. so why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three scientologists from what i can make out have scanned all three user pages and a lot of comments are unsigned about how the project is biased against elron? would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging npov possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out nonnpov statements on the talk pages of those articles? after all xenu is fa status so the npov cannot be too far off. as for unsigned the comment you left after my first post was unsigned and there were a couple of more during the discussion.,0

2482,im in twothree minds over this proposal. as regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic ive seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a wprs is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards. on the third hand we do get some nohopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as nonnotable. in the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking thats why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as i can tell. andemu ,0

2492,parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know betterdear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing. she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it. i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section. she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike. not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you.to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in. then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version. is that soapboxing??to use another example closer to home. lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail? like he clearly said here under the desperate? heading heeeeelp. and then he also bizarrely? asks gregalton help him delete references to like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism? can you believe it? i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this. the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll. he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. it made me realize that were going around in circles. we improve the articles to the point that they look great. then they get screwed up again. so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery? it could help people who arent educated...the idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his. the guy is mad. if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation. then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing. zenwhat is clearly a piece of work. check out the dudes talk page. in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana. so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking. what a comboseeing this i ponder my options. i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better? versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions. for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the eight? people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page. it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing. is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines? this is like watching evolution in reverse. i carefully construct a page with the help of others. it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos?. instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0

2512,again this replaceability argument simply does not work. we are not looking for another image of the flag being placed on the roof we are looking for another free image of the battle. the argument about a panoramic view is potentially a better argument. however why a panoramic view is required is not as clear we have plenty of images of destruction. do we really need to go the extent of using a nonfree image to show a panorama? of course not the destruction could easily be shown in other ways. we do not use a nonfree image because it is better than other available images we use a nonfree image because it shows something that could not be shown in any other way that urgently needs to be shown. ,0

2516,i also did a bit of work on putting the references in the somewhat odd format that wikipedia uses. one good rule to use is to include all the information you can title date author so that another editor can verify the information in the source. the article caught my eye because we once lived nearby. the description paragraph still seems like almost verbatim from the form and we are supposed to paraphrase into these articles. i am running out of time this afternoon but it should give you an idea if you havetime to work on it some more. the paul shoup article itself needs similar work. thanks. ,0

2528,frankly this is a waste of everybodys time. it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again full in the knowledge that you will not accept them. your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole. you have consistently failed to assume good faith and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article. you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was. yet you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy. we havent moved on significantly.if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us. wpucs is a guide an essay not policy. in any case common sense dictates that on controversial articles material is more likely to be challenged than on noncontroversial ones. this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us. the material has implications for npov. these are the facts that are relevant here. a long circular argument on talk helps noone. talk ,0

2573, talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you. peter iii of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin? your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. the reasons to prefer the coin areit is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w/ a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese kingin your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. srnec the problem is that we have different criteria.you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information.i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. the two representations have the same chance of not being % accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other.if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing. but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time. i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary. do you have an argument? why are your criteria better than mine? really? when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons. but i do not want another long discussion with you. i offer consensus. would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? both of those are improvements over the thcentury image but not over the coin. at least one other editor agrees with me. sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. this discussion is already too long. both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life. either both seem right. imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. you are not allowed to impose your will. both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles. they were reviewed by several editors. stop with your edit warring. lecen is aware of the threerevert rule. are you? youve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours. you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.,0

2576,regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada my reading of his csr transcript is exactly the opposite. he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five stolen? canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan.regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to khaldan for years? i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team. but if the camp had been a college i think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer. a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted. az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training. and once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones. he had helped grads slip into bosnia during the civil war there. i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp. his location was a secret for four years. he was found in a libyan prinson in april by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him. and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide. i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version his pretorture versions of what the camp did.,0
2577,as i suspected complete nonsense. your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is. you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided. i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption. i am not a stupid person. i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick.you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability commentby the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.heres a few points for you to think on.wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.then lets consider the arbcom an article. what then is this articles content?hmm lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of? why members. so that means the content of the committee is its members. so an election is a decision on the content of this article.so.members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.you dont like that?wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.but arbcom is not an article. it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions.is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership? if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid? would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder? if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing? can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? the questions were politely put. they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom. they were not deferential. which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully. do not try to bully me.finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here. ,0
2578,what do you consider primary sources in this context? she notes the obvious homoerotic passages in rydbergs poetry and fiction which are primary sources for literary criticism. the details of rydbergs sexually troubled childhood and his uneasy relationship with women were presumably taken from his standard biographical sources. i have no idea what sources svanberg and stolpe used i cant ask them. again no other scholar has questioned the accuracy of their conclusions which seems to me to be the definition of a scholarly consensus.,0

2582,no jp is not a good source and i will remove it pending a better source. my issue is jp has an agenda. i came across them when checking the edit which one editor put in. but they seemed very keen on jp when one editor used it to say muslims were a tiny tiny percentage. i never knew jp up until then. see the edit history for this edit. now here is what i do know. go and look at all the notable seer start with ndour what is his religion? % muslim. what i am realizing is most serer are muslim people. synergistic is not unique to africa it is in every corner of the planet where islam and christianity live. so islam accommodates this all the key historian on islam say this. especially david robinson and others. vodon per kwami is a good example. even in the caribbean google jesus in the morning vodon in the evening. these people are classified as christian. i do not think we will get exact stats but should not go with the pov that most serer practices their religion which is a myth. note any strange ip edits can be investigated.,0
2583,thanks. i am not entirely familiar with the first austrian republic awards system but given the common cross was a service award for a months service in the freikorps and as it was awarded to just about everyone who served i dont think it should be included. the special cross though is notable given only or so were supposedly issued so i will add it. i propose adding the exact date of the award of the verleihung der ehrenbürgerschaft into the text where the award is already mentioned. i understand the medal of merit in gold was a lower award but am unsure how common or notable it might be. i am not a fan of including every medal awarded to military people as i know some are incredibly common and not notable. have you any source that tells us where it might have been in the awards hierarchy? regards send... over,0

2655,fair use rationale for imagethanks for uploading or contributing to image i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. ,0

2705, i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world. you still prefer previous title i.e. united nations statistical divisions to the current one i.e. united nations geoscheme?if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones. google this statistical divisions site the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments. google this statistical divisions sitetherefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m. . un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical. i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping. natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country. i use it quiet often. it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as un geoscheme. try google book search and you will find at least the followingthe best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia. as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories....the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region ....country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification....were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme /unsd/methods/m/... that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme. in fact ...i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc. have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research. this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better. although it is not official term or a technical term un m. i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m. . moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm. of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidence/citations here before i bring it to rm. comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ,0

2749,records of awesome editors who truly want to help==as this is not a study of peoples hesitancy it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for peoples hesitancy. it would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. if this study is the reason for peoples hesitancy then we should be pointing to a reliable thirdparty source that states that its the reason not to the study itself. if we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film jaws we use as a reference the source that makes that statement not the film itself. so no its not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. nat gertler talk that has got to be the clearest explanation yet. so what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality then cite both sources? or should i use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. is this where wiki gets the facts from opinions then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is wpor? it is built by popular opinion of the editors from opinion pieces not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though i hope notdcrsmama talk no im not saying cite both sources. references are there to verify the facts that are being stated in wikipedias voice. if the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy there is no need to cite the study. even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study we might mention this study in the text but the study itself is not reference for the statement. and i am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. if you have concerns about the other sources in the article you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. nat gertler talk from wprps==,0

2757,so the link was a personnal attack? how funny. and i thought it was a good critic on your contribution on this page. here without the external link just for youonly me who is arguing? you have been blocking anybody who does not agree with you on this issue. shameful and now you want to find a way to make her less portuguese than canadian. what a joke “stating that she is no more canadian than she is portuguese is misleading. she was born in canada and she lives in canada.” where are your sources for such a brilliant comment? you should apply for an award for the silliest entry on wikipedia. ” but come on lets get real here” this not an acceptable comment from an administrator who also erased information with reliable sources just to get his own way. now you decide there are different degrees of nationality being the canadian the top one. pathetic. and you say it is personal attack if i consider that you have a xenophobic view on this issue because you underestimating one nationality to emphasize the other? your own your neutrality on this issue is something inexistent “content must be written from a neutral point of view npov representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources this is nonnegotiable and expected on all articles and of all article editors” “the other two are wikipediaverifiability and wikipediano original research”.you not only erased reliable sources that say she is portuguesecanadian you also have no sources whatsoever to claim she is more canadian than portuguese if such a thing ever exists other than in your mind show the sources if you can prove it is not your own “original theory”. “the current version clearly states that she holds both nationalities.” what a lie citizenship is not the same as nationality and even nationality could have a different meaning depending of context and if what you claim was true you would not be erasing all the time that she is portuguesecanadian.,0

2759,fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in . by the name fc citizens vardar the club won championships from till . about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together. each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal. how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup. the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents. the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as republics but yet without a nation those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions . in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and vranje prvinces. these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships. in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for the ww the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league. after the ww the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in . the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s macedonian republic league was transformed in to macedonian first league. so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level. its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side. serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues. they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league. they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition. for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information. second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship.,0

2771,hello barto. i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it? as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left. these are terms both i and ron himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights. i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details.however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article. i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr. gostick. the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him. this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridges document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for.i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself. i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him. i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs. there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense. an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gosticks page in case he didnt know it existed. be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later. one was a recent highlevel member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it. living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone. feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish. do you have a wiki email or a private one? ,0

2804,hey. it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. you have to change this attitude on your part. your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. you guys are of course wrong. you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine. your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia. i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason. it is just plain innacurate....,0

2819,first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste. one refutation is more than sufficient. second your rationales appear to be shifting. originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements. now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable. be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy. given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source. i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy. consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues. this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy. this means no specious claims. and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues. can you abide by these conditions? ,0

2832,deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists. so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert/yorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environmentfrom a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two. if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy ? this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.this scenario is dennetts and to some extent everetts. since the question doesnt even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. you might conclude that this question doesnt make any sense. but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not. in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy .to give an example of actual or and synth ill go beyond dennetts example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective. for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later. what is the subjective experience? from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? boltzmanns brain is a similar idea. ,0

2842, october utcthis is a nontrivial problem. many perhaps most of the editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits i can think of two fa writers in that group one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits another spends a lot of time on awb. any analysis of those would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types. then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed. but most importantly the accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active . spielchequers ,0

2855,yes you got it the govt lied. see the talk page for cselr ok im lazy and not typing current page name. they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from. i have provided the link to the index of papers produced mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw so you can confirm that the business case was never provided. there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary. some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and posttfnsw publications such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are % lower.. i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about. that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language. the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions. the terms of reference open to the public to see for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this. i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past selfproclaimed senior executive of tfnsw. so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group. = link to index of docs produced for st call that is why there was the nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at. by making the nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the st call they made it public. the outcome they expected was what ended up happening.,0

2862,i agree. i certainly agree that the last paragraphs should be removed as ive argued above. im agnostic on the rest but agree that a full rewrite should be undertaken by a knowledgable editor.,0
2863,i disagree. the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if cameron were to die/resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt. clegg may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.,0

2888, dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. this isnt a list of people who kinda sorta theres a small chance maybe are transgender.the ones who crossdressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it. the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is guan yin. the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something e.g. military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered.the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too? also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact.and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to ed wood? you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them. that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.maxwell klinger wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army. anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality. whats the association between the two?also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here. ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. june utc,0

2893,==street gang==mr. davisthanks for your note on my talk page i really appreciate it and its an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book. as this articles creator and main editor im sorry that you thought the review section was so negative. please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book. in my rush to get the article published i did a google search and those are the reviews i found. also please understand that this is a wikipedia article and the article as it now stands will never be complete. its a work in progress. i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there. i am by no means a professional writer so im certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors. i wouldve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work. i appreciate your feedback something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor. if you are aware of other sources that i wasnt able to locate please send them my way on my talk page. ill repeat this message via your webpage to ensure that you see it.you should also know that ive taken it upon myself to improve all sesame streetrelated articles on wikipedia. its a big project and a great need. for example sesame street at one point was actually a featured article but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons. its an unfortunate state at the current time. your book came out shortly after i took on the project so its been a boom for me. i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start so your book has been a valuable resource. ive already started working on this article history of sesame street and if you look at the reference section youll see that ive used your book extensively. its also a work in progess and no where near finished. my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame streets th anniversary in november. i cant tell you how much your book has helped me.on a personal level i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book. it was a fun read and immensely interesting. i was brought to tears many times especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air. see im turning this year which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it. i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized they did all that for me i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly and now the life of my own children who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do. i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia and ive taken it upon myself to help accomplish that. if you as the ultimate expert could assist me in that goal i cant tell you how valuable that would be. again thanks for the feedback and communication. ,0

2900,its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement. there was a recent newspiece a quote by putin times of israel putin first soviet government was mostly jewish. apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact. in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article.,0

2902,you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources. this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions. brian krebs a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog krebs on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up. ... then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer ... and ... iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions ... proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics. it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided. and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company. contributions talk ,0
2903,jung and einstein in albert einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in aarau switzerland. in after school in switzerland einstein renounced his german citizenship. carl p. jung was born in in the swiss canton or county of thurgau. while jung worked on wandlungen und symbole der libido psychology of the unconscious tensions grew between freud and jung. frank p. geyer continued to serve as a detective until august when he resigned. he had been transferred to the th police district in the united states. detective geyer had arrested james anderson whether this is the same anderson mentioned in detective geyers work is nondeterminable. in tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. in albert einstein acquired swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper obtaining a teaching position at school in schaffhausen switzerland. the fbi file on einstein came to light in when robert alan schwartz wrote an article on the subject for the nation magazine. between j. edgar hoover and john hutchison democratic rights didn’t stop with mccarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of socalled notorious j. edgar hoover. yet for years zeropoint energy according to hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. john hutchisons claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are like nasa. the fbi should do an article on nasa and their nondeterminable webers.i do not find it too surprising schwartz once more wrote about not only frank geyer but albert einstein with not too much said about carl p. jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.,0
2904, msa garratts hithe idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error. that is understandable as the subject is complex. the wagr first imported the m class garratts in . these are very important locos because they are the third class of garratt to be built and the first main line garratt showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated. so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. both classes were built by beyerpeacock.the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops. apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.the story does not end there but moves to victoria. the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. outside framed garratts are very rare even in the smaller gauges. but wait there is more no not steak knives. the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g.so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed.personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients. some work would be required to hunt down variations though. so yes i think it does deserve an article.please feel free to use the above if you wish.cheersmichael.,0
2905,please pardon me if its a stupid question as i havent really done a lot of work with categories in the past. but does that sort of change really need a cfd? i think that if i had found myself with a similar subcat idea i would have just gone ahead and done it or more likely thrown it at a relevant project talk page to see if there were objections. of course maybe you werent able to get consensus at the project hence the post to cfd. again sorry if this seems stupid — as i branch out into new and different tasks i just like to understand the thinking of people who are engaged with them more regularly. i find it helps me with my own decisionmaking.,0

2923,controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip. in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology. in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around. so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy. mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw. i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw. rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means. i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for. however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine. the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines. the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable. agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines. the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips. just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that.what i suggest is a compromise. i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or. mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use. do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated? without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage. im thinking something like this....clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however mw defines it as such.this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated. i think this is fair. note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here. im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly. ,0

2979,i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteattempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape. if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader.i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do. to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal. and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway.further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists? paperclips? light bulbs?some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out.am i missing something? p.s. what do you mean about wpciv?,0
2980,none beefart repliesthanks for you comments. few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles. i disagree with you about none. the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one. in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one. it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs. it has to be no one is a dinosaur. here are two examples from the oed e.j. howard except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable. p. rose people sought her... but none was a companion. however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from graham greene who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited. this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight. maybe i ought to as well . there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. e.g. none of the increase is due to.... here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing. i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase... ,0

2984, the truth about the sinn féin ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party. how he broke the sinn féin constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn féin membership. and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. in section b. of the sinn féin constitution read as follows“no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. the adams leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis. its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle.b. shall not draw their salaries for personal use. parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser’s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as followsthat section b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the ard chomhairle. obviously motion infringes section b. section b. was in effect at the time this resolution was presented. its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure. he should have sought a majority decision to amend section b. in and returned in to propose entering leinster house. trying to amend section b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist county parliament” in the same resolution was a logical impossibility. can anybody say that the wording“that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle?clearly adams was in breach of section b. and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution .brian feeney in his book sinn féin turbulent years puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section b by introducing a motion in allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the sinn féin constitution. this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section b in any way. to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. in fact the line adams added in was superfluous as the sinn féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.of course its not illegal to amend or remove section b. section b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies. it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority. the reason for doing so could be many. perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic. in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason. but you,0

3004,ive never seen creative director used in the infobox for tv shows because creative director is not a title actually held by someone at least in fictional series to the best of my knowledge. it is production designer and thats what theyre credited as. it also looks quite odd in the infobox where you have someone who is the production designer listed so high in the infobox just below the creator and above more notable roles such as the cast and executive producers. this is a good topic of discussion for templateinfobox television that creativedirector should be changed to productiondesigner in the infobox and then moved into the production portion of the infobox along with other similar crew roles. ,0

3007,doherty epilogue==why does the section mainstream scholarly reception end in a comment by doherty himself decidedly not a part of that mainstream which basically says that someone else should come along. isnt this akin to a proponent of a minority view saying that one day oh happy day the majority will come to see the wisdom of the minority view and change its mind. revision and changing minds are an essential part of all branches of scholarship but why should we give a platform to any one view in this? smile back well... i do see your point... but i think theres arguably validity in assigning a special preference to the view of the subjects of the article of which doherty is a notable example and the only one im aware that has commented on the subject. ==,0

3015,i bother to note the other issue because wikipedia is explicitly a collaborative editing system and making changes that as i said obscure the substance of your edits with lots of nonsubstantive changes makes the former goal harder. there are even explicit guidelines against needless/constant changing of irrelevancies such as this.,0

3017, on the way forward consider this before posting here i would much prefer it if certain people did not post on this page. so before posting please consider whether you might be described as a tendentious canvasser or drama seeker mischiefmaker advocate misrepresenter someone who piles on without clue or someone carrying over by association the disputes that they have with contributors elsewhere. if you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you and if you are an admin chillum comes to mind then find another. im not keen on this because it restricts collaboration but hey people like that basically just seem to vent poke or offer weird advice when i am the subject of their attention. im human not a saint while my ability to tolerate the types described above is not bad it is also not infinite.id be pleased if the time that you would have spent here is expended instead on editing indiarelated articles. but bear in mind that you will need to be able todeal knowledgeably with touchy and repetitivelyraised issues such as hindutva religious and casterelated povpushinghandle completely clueless newbies on a large scale many of them encouraged to edit by an illconsidered wmf initiativehandle often largescale sock and meatfarms and masses of copyvio and blp violationstake copious amounts of general abuse pretty much dailyface all sorts of physical and legal threats both on and offwiki as well as reallife stalking over prolonged periods by multiple peopleall with little or no support from the wmf and large swathes of the community who are more interested in the neverending tendentious discussion of meta issues among them policy honor and the creation of a wikitopia than actually improving content where it matters most.and when you need a break from articles that relate to per cent of the worlds population and which suffer grossly from bias systemic and otherwise go chill by creating a ga or at least a bclass article more or less singlehanded. do all of this and youll make me a very happy and surprised man. do it for kish edits without getting blocked on spurious grounds or otherwise then youll be really quite remarkable.im not saying that i will be back but if i do return id rather not see stuff here from the types of people described above. thanks. ,0
3018,that could be an option but i dont see why that would be needed since they have stated an official motive of their organisation which is equal righst for sunnis while stressing many times that they are not seperatist. just because of some wiki editor not wanting that to be put into the article for some reason doesnt mean people should be deprived of sourced information.,0

3043,i asked you to ensure you were accurate because if you were wrong wpspade i would accurately call you a liar. userbullrangifer made a comment that my alleged use of unreliable sources ... doesnt exactly help your credibility. however this statement was not true at all and has no basis in reality. it was fabricated simply to damage my credibility. he says this despite the fact that i had not used any unreliable sources on the page. his poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. when asked for clarification of his accusation he produces four links. of the four two were posted after his offensive comment was made. therefore i assume he was taking about the first two links that i had already provided when he said it. the first two links both of them were from of newspaper articles from the washington post . yes both of them this person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce more reliable sources that damages his credibility not mine. im calling bullshit on everything he said. for the reasons above i am calling userbullrangifer a liar. chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy. he got his lame comment in before i posted the second two links. those links were for the associated press and government of canada but lots of other reliable places have this stuff. he didnt back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. for this reason is also a liar. thats not all. this person must be the brains of this operation. right here on this page puts forth the argument that and none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory. i think his credibility was lacking prior to his comment about me. its pretty obvious that logical thinking is lacking here too. previously ive called his position the dumbest possible argument for anything ever. ,0

3074,annual murder rate per million indians in india = all australians in oz= indians in oz=. the official explanation for the higher rate for indians in oz compared with all australians is that they are much more likely to be young and male and about half of all violent crime involves young males. unofficially i would point out that if you eliminate indian murders by indians in oz then suddenly the difference gets much smaller. so it is pretty damn simple indians murder each other wherever they are. please do something about it if you care.,0

3076,under such criteria you better be inserting notability templates into each and every unsourced article that exists. since we have had unsourced blps in wikipedia for years that is not sufficient criteria for determining if something is notable or not. the standard is if such could be found. there are already several sources in the article about several european groups in mexico such as the mennonites and spanish refugees. could the article be improved? definitely. but notability is not an issue except to those who beleive that europeans or whites do not or better stated should not exist in latin america.,0

3082,listen up sj are you going to let me show you that you are wrong? first i offered you my email address. then you could email me. second you are wrong about the attacks. being fed up with incompetence on this site is justifiable. you guys see vandals where there is only a desire to bring back some civilized behavior. we arent all chan people. some of us have much more education than you will ever have. are smarter than you will ever be. have connections. are unwilling to let you do what you dang well please.also tone? have you heard of satire? i dont believe in hate mail. no talk pages are the downfall of this site. they are a tool for you to do what you want. and no we dont all have irc or want to have it. not even all computer operating systems have it.warning? there were no warnings issued. a vandal seekinghappy user complained and no warnings were even issued. so you have demonstrated that you are completely incompetent. now could we maybe start working towards addressing these topics? ,0
3083,good lord. i mentioned the clusterfucked bureaucracy but i did not anticipate your adherence to it. you deleted my post and it was regarded as vandalism when i tried to repost it. one of the editors which removed my information was on trial for being a bot. im not sure what edit war you are referring to other than my own additions to your page which you state at the top that you welcome. your immediate removal of my edit was very suspicious to me as it seemed pretty authoritative. are you on the edits to marmaduke subscription list? i dont understand. i do not think i am acting like a child. if childish behavior to you is using bad language then call me a a child i suppose. i did not call you any personal names and only referred to what i thought of as a hierarchy on wikipedia as a clusterfucked bureaucracy. i can call your edits an ego trip which they increasingly seem to be as you want to talk to me like i am a child even calling me childish. it seems as if you didnt even consider the several links i included in my last post inculding npr. i am trying to tell you that i made a reasonable edit to a page one that i made before and which lasted several months before i noticed it was gone tonight. you assertion that i am willing to bet no one will show you more sympathy than i will is further proof that this process is an ego trip for you. if users are all equal than i would prefer it if you left me alone. my edit is not inflammatory and included a link to the website. if needs be i can include all of the links i provided on your page if that is enough to validate my claim that marmaduke explained is a relatively popular blog. if all users are equal then why does your designation of my writing as nonnotable brand me with vandalism when i attempt to repost the content? please explain yourself.thanksyournumbertwofan,0

3131,again i disagree. scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness particularly for the question of the roma and the disable. in fact as you go through modern academic literature the last years holocaust more and more includes nonjewish victims. just an example alex callinicos from york university the holocaust isfor good reasons i need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. all the different kinds of domination fused together in auschwitzracism directed at jews slavs and roma the economic exploitation of slave labour the oppression of gays and women the persecution of dissenting minorities such as communists and jehovahs witnesses. or slawomir kapralski identity building and the holocaust roma political nationalism. i have already mentioned sybil milton who was a senior historian at the research institute of the us holocaust memorial museum and henry friedlander a leading holocaust historian in the usa is another important voice. this increasing consensus has had an impact on common language as well on political bodies. see this press release from the un for instance. it is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist mordern project and the common fate of the victims. the famous pictures of mengeles twins are of roma children. the technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the t. the tactics of eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of poland against polish leaders. i have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of jews in the holocaust i have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.if this is not enough let me try in another way by deciding to describe the holocaust as an exclusive jewish event wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate i could say on the declining side of an ongoing scholarly debate. this is not holocaust denial with no legitimacy in the academia and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes. at very least wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead ,0

3201, ufc afds those were never transcluded to the afd page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing. im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the afd banners from the articles ill delete the afd pages when i get the chance. i havent been able to spend much time on wikipedia lately. looks like theyve been officially listed as afds. ill leave them alone for now. jake bostwick ive only nominated a few very obvious mma people before. bostwick was deleted via afd discussion. a speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied. to me he still fails wpmmanot but im in no way a mma expert. what do you think? at first glance it appears that bostwick hasnt fought at the highest level of mma as required by wpathlete or whatever the guideline is these days and wpmmanot. if i had an interest in having the article removed i would afd it again. hello it has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. can i first point out that jake bostwick is a former ucmma middleweight champion and currently the ucmma welterweight champion? ucmma is along with bamma and cage warriors the biggest mma promotion in the united kingdom. secondly after glancing over wpmmanot and wpathlete i see that they are indeed guidelines. now i may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in afds as the sole reason why to delete any article. thirdly i have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page i have found very strong sources from websites such as the sun the mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called party wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a wheel clamper only strengthens his notability. the very sources on him alone helps him pass wpgng which is all you need to pass a page on wikipedia in my opinion.i would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion i find is a bit disrespectful towards me however i fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now i have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more. userpoundpound since you filed the spi i wanted to update you that ive reversed the block. i requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation. i had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however i fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case. i completely see why you reported it i did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here. just wanted to update you. ¢ © join wer alpha chi national honor society copyright i made changes and enhancements to the alpha chi national college honor society page including citations to sources. the director of operations contacted wikipedia granting permission for material from the website to be used by wikipedia. she received a reply indicating that it was safe to move forward with the edits. nearly a month later you removed the edits. is there something im missing here?a copy of the email sent to wikipedia and the replydear lara noahthank you for your email. our response follows your message.// lara,0

3227,anyone have any thoughts on the addition of bernard lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians? since augustine aquinas are listed and lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers i thought he would be a good addition to the list. his work is wellregarded in th century philosophy he certainly has the credentials and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle augustine and aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see insight a study of human understanding. there are lonergan centers at boston college university of toronto seton hall and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. im quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable.my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so thought i would throw it out there. ,0

3230,speedy deletion of indian association of special libraries and information centres a tag has been placed on indian association of special libraries and information centres requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. please see wikipediastub for our minimum information standards for short articles. also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0

3239,well in case anyones interested in following up on this further using the la trobe university online search engine a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ truncated to allow for various inflections leads to bjt record hits at least of which are in the pali canon. heres the first page of the search results with links to the subsequent pages as well . of course this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term nor what this term means in the context of various suttas since multiple records can be part of a single sutta. similarly this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term etc.. fwiw a quick review of these results potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words e.g. netti peta one in the abhidhammas kathavatthu once in the visuddhimagga and times in the pali histories. if nothing else this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by peter and myself might possibly be among? the core texts. with metta talk ,0

3248, as daft as it sounds yes if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wptruth wpverifable wprs wpnor and wpnor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. talk contrib as it says on my talk page i prefer to have discussions all in the same place. i am watching this page so please reply here. to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here. so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either youll insist on a source for that too? seriously you are mistaken on a few points. i think you need to read wpverify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace including everything in articles lists and captions must be verifiable. all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. emphasis added jeh note the distinction. you wrote if it cant be verified it gets removed. but first the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified. not only is it part of the definition of the term the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. so no we dont need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. and second except for blp issues wpv only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. this material didnt need a source and even if it did it isnt required to remove it right away. even for claims that really should have a citation to a wprs the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template. see templatecn. this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someones edit rather than simply reverting it. i suppose you could say well since i removed it its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source. yeah fine. so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs thats already there and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. no its not much work but consider does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? was it the best use of yours? and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future? also in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices. in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to sic. well that is true but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article nor even claim that such were wrong. so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. finally i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. after reading wpverify you should probably look at wpvandalismeven if misguided willfully against consensus or disruptive any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. edit warring over content is not vandalism. careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial detrimental but wellintentioned and vandalizing. mislabelling goodfaith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wpagf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it. in sum please be careful about undoing others edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wpverify. consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material. please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism. and you should never have intentions of editwarring so the statement that you dont have any here is troubling. why would you need to state such a thing if not for the possibility that you might have s,0

3273, mediawikiduplicatedefaultsort do you realize what a wonderful thing this is? when you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created? i hope not because i have been although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under s and t while i finish l and do m through r i will not complain.when i stumbled across the category there were pages in it. by the end of today there will be fewer than . my goal is to get all the nontrivial items resolved by the end of next week so i can start on the pages in categorybiography articles without listas parameter a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life. because i am resolving the conflicts in the first category i have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks like you who know why the banners work as they do. i have also leaned what items can set the defaultsort. as an added bonus i have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts i did not know before and i have become almost addicted to preview.the absolutely best part about the dupds is that the category it has created that i will continue to monitor on a daily basis is a safety net for me when i mess something up on a page in categorybiography articles without listas parameter. the easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it wants it and will throw a fit if it is not there.thank you ,0

3280,xkcdhey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me randall munroe labeling it patently madeup information. understandable and taken in good humor of course and nothing on the page is sourced its more of a stub than anything. but im curious why you were so sure it was fabricated. xkcdi find it hard to believe that a yearold could have been working fulltime for nasa. of course you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe. schreit mich an i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated. i stayed for the better part of a year until late . nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects. its not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.anyway the information is taken from my published bio page but youre right you have no way of knowing whether im lying or not. i guess its probably safest to assume that i am.in that case ill admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place i know very little about science but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area. feel free to readd the info although the impression i got from the original version was more than you werent just a contract worker. if thats not even a valid distinction in the states its increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance. schreit mich an honestly they never really explained to me which one i was. i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots and nasa paid me through a government contractor. when i said i work for nasa no one argued. it was a lot more dilbertesque than you would expect. old echoing tile hallways with quiet gruff middleaged men working at blueprintcovered desks mild office politics lots of presentations and buzzwords and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way. i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work and it was good in a lot of ways but i was happy to leave. xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. actually this thing is new to me. thanks sure thing. the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook. that gets put onto the suggestions page which ill move it to in a moment. over the next few days people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long if it needs sources whatever else. if youre able to respond to those comments if there are any made then your article might get selected. schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what its not easy to do that since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page so i really cant just point you to a page and say here you are. what particularly do you want to see? if youre after examples of the kinds of comments people make just keep an eye on the suggestions page. schreit mich an caucasian ethnicitiessemites are caucasian. or indeed not. see for example semitic which clearly indicates otherwise. they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indoeuropean people who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless theres some startling new research out there i dont think that comment is accurate. schreit mich an im not even going to dignify this with a response. use,0
3281,i dont want anything in this article that isnt specific to rushtons book including generic comments by gilwhite that dont address rushton in particular and certainly not his book. just because gilwhite mentions rushton elsewhere in his book does not justify putting a completely separate criticism of race theories in general in section to devoted to criticism of his book. if you insist upon putting in generic critiques against race in general ill insist on putting in references that defend race in general. people come here not to read about the race debate in general but about this specific book and the response it got. i have no problem with the native american argument if it can be cited as a critique against this book but for now its an orginal argument composed by wikipedia editors.,0

3303,history of primal therapy articlei read through the recent discussions on talkprimaltherapy. i also added two more comments to the talkarthurjanov page. did you send an email enquiry? the date for france ds marriage to art is without credibility. after the divorce to vivians great credit she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov. after all he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated. chapter . and according to france d. janovs own admission in the primal centers video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. so its a fact that art married a former patient.my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. it isnt really the place to dissect janovs reputation. i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies but in many cases it has got out of hand. i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article. the conocer piece doesnt strike me as a sound source of verifiable information so i put together some links to articles which can be found onlineif you type emotional intelligence into google the no. result is steve heins website. he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janovs primal center in the late s. you can find his interview notes here labelled cautionary note.janovs bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr. janov’s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr. erik hoffman former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university. you can read what erik hoffmann ph.d. is doing now at hoffmanns website.on this page you can find a transcript of dr. e. michael holdens account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute.carol mithers book therapy gone mad identifies case histories from janovs first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy. simon thanks simon why cant you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page? i dont think the history idea will come to much there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingolds latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. i have already read the michael holden swan song twice sad case. you seem to be applying two standards of evidence. the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janovs books alone which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. last september i wrote in the primal therapy talk page will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbachers method or the international primal association or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the s? there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article for a start two books about the center for feeling therapy erik hoffmanns bio and the transcript of dr. e. michael holdens audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in . the books by carol mithers and tomas videgård are already referenced in the main article. i have a copy of videgårds book by the way. also professor steven rose wrote a onepage account of his research with arthur janov in lifelinesas janov had hoped it turned out that before therapy the quantity of these particular receptors in his clients platelets was considerably below normal. within six months of therapy clients depression had lifted and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for normal nondepressed people of the same age and sex.further down the same page he addedi obtained similar biochemical results when a couple of years later i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other less dramatic forms of psychotherapy so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.having participated in the editing of articles in t,0

3322, yeah i think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors arent just mere repetitions of the authors statement and dont elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. also ill like to point out these mistakes in your comment per eliade approximative understanding partly of apparently nonarabian rites so not mucheildae never says it was nonarabian. shes talking about monophysite rites and monophysite was the largest branch of christianity in arabia. per watt details that may be surmised by close analysis muhammads lifehe also argues that these verses might be attacking christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. also in the final ill like to say again the subject of the article isnt about quran and its historicity and interpretations. so adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text. ,0

3344, trimming sounds fine but where a dispute comes up i would recommend slowing things down. focus on one or two specific quotes and if someone reverts instead of immediately reverting back try to come up with a compromise version. ditto with the other person reverting instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version try to come up with a compromise. with each person changing each others work rather than reverting it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. also use clear calm and neutral edit summaries referring strictly to the article and not the editors. in terms of refactoring what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to. when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or hes just always stubborn then thats getting away from discussing the article content and is veering off into discussing the editors. better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors. good habits to develop though they can take time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your. also avoid naming specific editors in a post as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive and then they may miss everything else thats said. instead when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done diff the edit without mentioning the editor. like i disagree with this edit diff as i feel its a violation of policy/guideline. a better way to handle things would be suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this but i have seen that using this kind of thirdparty discussion technique can work wonders in deescalating disputes. it also tends to make whoever is using the technique sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful even if offwiki they may be hopping mad. it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action. when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute and they see everyone yelling at each other the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong. the admin wont care who started it theyll just address things as they see them in that moment. but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly and one editor being uncivil then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption. caveat just because one editor is being uncivil doesnt necessarily mean that theyre in the wrong. but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all theyre doing is namecalling rather than actually discussing the article then thats a problem that an administrator can easily address by removing the nonconstructive editors from the discussion. onka ,0

3353,it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre but i was trying to correct and add some information about him. i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a prolefebvre position as well. i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre. the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that. both men tried to derail the second vatican council and fought both john xxiii and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way. i dont know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george iii was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant. and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council. why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church? it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity. i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while he didnt exactly what his grandfaters reasons were but he said it probably wasnt hard to guess why.even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article. thats why i added the tag because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction. jun utc,0

3376,jehovah’s witnesses and blood transfusionsthanks for your assistance at improving this article. i am happy to provide any of the reference material cited therein if and when you choose to continue on the subject and hopefully you will continue. this subject material is similar to other religious issues—there is much emotion and consequential contentious behavior. the remedy for an encyclopedic entry is reliance on reputable and verifiable sources that present objective information. this particular subject is extraordinarily serious because it involves life and death medical decisions. hence the need for an even higher standard of seeking sources of information with no history of hostility toward one view or another. again thanks for your assistance.,0

3381,roazir fars is the arabic version of pars the iranian name when translated to english is “the gulf of pars” and the english name “persian gulf” means exactly the same thing interestingly enough most gulfs in the world are called like the iranian name for e.g. gulf of mexico gulf of aden gulf of carpentaria gulf of the farallones gulf of maine gulf of tonkin gulf of guinea etc etc so the correct name for the persian gulf should have been “the gulf of pars” just as the iranian name is as for the azarbaijan as both versions already exist on the wiki and we are not inventing a new name i insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. the whole population of rep azerbaijan is less than % of the population of iran let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word azarbaijan like iranians do so why a vast majority should follow a small minority? it is azarbaijan and english speaking people better get used to it,0

3384,thanks moonriddengirl. wikidea im sure youre an excellent lawyer and i admire your goal to turn wikipedia into a superior reference work for law students its one i share with one amendment. wikipedia is not a legal resource for lawyers and law students. it is not a casebook. it is not a practitioners text. it is a work for the laypeople to explain as simply as possible in this case how the law works. thats what you should aspire to with your articles and its what i aspire to with mine. the layperson is more helped by thirdparty references and summaries than to them unintelligible case citations and full body quotations from judgments. while such quotations and citations have their place this i feel uses such case citations well but i might be a teensy bit biased they are the obiter not the ratio.,0

3399, i...butter is a butter substitute the references given see discussion on this above on this are improperly given. what is given appears to be little more than a google screen scrape. i managed to find both references and they do not support this usage. the use in these publications is not to define but to indicate the broad category. peanut butter if placed in the category of a nut butter is also in the category if butter substitute but it is not a type of margarine which is what this product is. possibly it might be helpful to say that the product is commonly used to substitute butter but it doesnt help in the basic definiton. ,0

3406,hi. we have three members already. we all seem interested in the project. i have created a template to place on articles talk pages. an user from the spanish wikiproject has just suggested that we translate articles from one wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator but noone responded yet. one of the members is interested in writing about gay literature and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or lgbt literature. i believe this was the first discussion of the project. two of us think that lgbt literature would be best. i dont have a lot of time to dedicate to the project so i would like it if it didnt depend on me to survive and grow and be successful. the other two members have asked what they can do for the project. i would like to write something to better explain what a wiki project is for because this seems unclear. i believe its not much of a big deal its just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place so if something important happens concerning that subject for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know. it should also create a sense of community and its good to have that since well be editing the same articles. i think things are going fine except that i dont know whether the other members see this as i do.,0

3421, marduk = abraham. the early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world.marduk is a regional variant of abraham. so is zoroaster.adam as we know him was the first prophet of dyeus and the first human consciousness we see in history. dyeus became zeus jupiter with piter from fertilitycult distortions and yah etc. god ofcourse for many.idris was the second prophet of tengri which became thor many places sometimes god sometimes more of a prophet and again indra prometheus osiris.these concepts are known everywhere with local variations.knowing the regional names one can see the same change in the regions who talk about marduk as here. a change from early prophetic teachings to that of abraham.and sarai of the bible is saraswati in hinduism and sarpanit here. obviously we all have the same prophetic line teaching monotheism. god is without others.peace be with you.,0

3444,csd aokay sorry about that i was just really confused as to what they were pertaining to but i now see that there is a main la liga article that does provide context. thanks. sorry that was my mistake i misunderstood it. thew user i know its this guy. the article clearly should be deleted and an afd would be pointless. if i were an admin i would block him right away and delete his stuff. well blocked isnt banned. repeated block evasion might result in banning though. moreover i actually deleted an artcile of his per wikipediaarticles for deletion/quantum ring theory. that mentioned some naveen dankal so the latest account might be also be likeminded person. ill give him a welcome page and then well see. oh youre an admin? i thought there was some sort of rule that admins had to say so on their user pages.he might not be technically banned but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were. i dont know how else to deal with this. not sure about the rule but i actually forgot to restore my user page after latest wikibreak.for the moment i assume the two accounts are not the same. if not well certainly notice and can take action. heisenbergs scientific method naveen dankal with due respect to heisenberg and his contribution to science i don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidual.i have only stated some of the limitations of heisenbergs works with due references and just brought out a fact how heisenbergs method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way lopesidedness of our universe.i just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia. on the other hand i also disagree with the block you received resp. the unblock denied and have raised that point. thanks for unblocking...appreciate your step...will try to keep wiki rules in mind may well let me know once you have further concerns or questions. naveen dankal i am making a few changes in the article on heisenbergs scientific method.i would like to know wether any refernces to banned members works jeopardizes the articles chances of getting hosted or such refernces can be incorporated without any hitch. moreover before hosting the articles can they be emailed to the administrators for a review so that the users are not lead to the worries of being blocked or banned?there are two different issues. the . while that doesnt mean they can never be cited it is unlikely to go without discussion. your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations. what is missing is the intermediate step what reliable sources have written about e.g. the mystery of the scarcity of the dineutron or limitations of the copenhagen interpretation. without including such secondary sources it will be a wpsy,0

3453, naji alali hi iani noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to . what is your source for that? im wondering because the arabic wikipedia article which this page started as a translation from cites his year of birth as while a book i have about him the one referenced in the article cites it as . what the book says in a footnote on the subject is sulaiman alshaikh the caricature artist naji alali in the kuwaiti magazine al`arabi no. august . naji al`ali saw this date and did not raise any objection. while the book is certainly not academic its also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is khalid al`ali the artists son.on the other hand on this page naji al`ali himself is quoted as saying i was born where christ was born between tiberias and nazareth in the village of alshahra in the northern galilee and i was expelled from there ten years later in to `ain alhilwe camp in lebanon.however the same site also bases its short biography of naji al`ali on the book i used and gives the year for his birth accordingly.unless you have a solid source i think we may have to leave it as unknown.by the way that site also shows a pretty cool pflp poster about his assassination i wonder could we get permission to use it... all the best talk ,0

3456, north korea actually gained approximately km² from china in the treaty. and heres a th century book by chong yagyong titled koreas northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by peter hacksoo lee a long time ago the area north of the tumen river was the land of the sushen people. it has not been under our control since the time of the three han. the southern slopes of mount changbaek where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters lay within our territory but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. however emperor kanghsi in the final years of his reign ordered area commander wula wula tsungkuan muketeng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. as a result the border between those two rivers is clear as well. emphasis mineheres another study of the usnorth korea border in by the us dept of state which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain. and another which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in . the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border and of course a few ultranationalist sites but please enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. on another rather amusing note it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits and which prefer to judge a book by its cover and lash out emotionally. should be made in a new section on the talk page. no further edits should be made to this section. the result of the debate was no move. requested movechonji → tianchi – the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus for pov reasons cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean its on the border between china and korea. another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well. however a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi and and less than each for chonji and cheonji. thats two orders of magnitude in difference. the preceding was quoted by yuje surveyadd support or oppose followed by a brief explanation then sign your opinion with support for the most common name. searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake. the use of chonji as a clear common name doesnt apply because its not common. support — per yuje. naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. oppose per visviva and my previous comments. like i said before we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china. as shown chonji is nowhere near common. chonji barely shows up any hits therefore isnt a viable alternative for a clear alternative name. oppose look at my reason below. comment the proposition seems to be flawed... given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else perhaps tianchi changbaishan or even heh heh tianchi paektusan but then again maybe tianchi jilin... if we must have a straw poll it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is. comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldnt be ignored. thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi disambiguation page. either one is a reasonable alterna,0

3468,wikipediamiscellany for deletion/userpropaniac/su hi. ive just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at mfd a couple months ago and it was deleted. tbh i dont remember what was there and i was just curious if you remembered the topic or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place. im not objecting to the deletion although im kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting and to find out that wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace i mean that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in articlespace that ive tried to delete but thats been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile. but again im not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place just wondering how it happened. thanks for any light you can shed.,0

3502,note from the subject bookśrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta«and he did not have to flatter anyone support anyone or manage anyones life. his mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. he saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. despite his advanced age he felt that he had barely begun his work. yet he felt confident. he had his vision of a world association of devotees. it was not an idle dream although he was not certain how it would all come about. but he knew his duty. for the present he would go on describing his vision the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters in articles and books. but as soon as possible he should go to the west. westerners he had concluded were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding more than his fellow indians they would be open to the message of the absolute truth. he knew he should go. and he would goif kṛṣṇa desired.abhay lived frugally in vṛndāvana keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. he carefully kept a ledger just as if he were running a substantial business even though his purchases were only a little milk a few vegetables charcoal for cooking bus rides and his major expenditure postage.abhay composed a bengali poem vṛndāvanabhajana. its opening stanzas were especially selfreflective and personal.i am sitting alone in vṛndāvanadhāma.in this mood i am getting many realizations.i have my wife sons daughters grandsons everythingbut i have no money so they are a fruitless glory.kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material natureby his strength it has all become tasteless to me today.yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye taddhanaṁ śanaiḥi gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom i am merciful. how was i able to understand this mercy of the allmerciful?»śrīla prabhupāda is here in the advanced age of – his supporters friends and family left him broke.śrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta another reference«prabhupādas most ambitious literary undertaking the completion of śrīmadbhāgavatam was to be no less than sixty volumes. he had begun in india in and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. now kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing vedic literatures and for travelling and he was working at an amazing pace.»prabhupāda is here in advanced age of starting to write his bhaktivedanta purports – i guess in india it was an advanced age but not in florida.,0

3506, utci dont think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written . the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others for a direct and definite compensation wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.for instance in the light of holocaust in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention but was taken to a tragic extreme. likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker if it is a profession has shown to conducted wholly for business gain i.e. higher profit larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain often to the detriment to the business e.g. accountants in the enron scandal. i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition and one that is couched in more modern language. talkcontribs november,0

3533,ivo banac...a bit of nonteleological historyone of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. for example if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. croatia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river a little bit to the east of the city of split. down the coast from the original croatia we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus the tenthcentury byzantine emperorhistorian called pagania literally land of the pagans zachlumia most of presentday eastern herzegovina with the croatian peninsula of peljesac terbounia the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina with dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs and dioclea the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of presentday albania around lake skadar/shkoder. serbia is located in the hinterland of zachlumia terbounia and dioclea its center around ras near todays novi pazar in the sandzak. bosnia was apparently within this territory but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river where we now find sarajevo and its environs. and dalmatia? in the tenthcentury this was a necklace of byzantineruled roman coastal cities and island territories from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south.moreover modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. thus unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnicas opposed to culturalcontinuity. the croat historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of dioclea a twelfthcentury text from bar in contemporary montenegro and its various translations for example marko marulic which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and dalmatian histories of mavro orbin and ivan lucic ioannes lucius . these works then became material for the croatianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic croatia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of ljudevit gaj and that of postrevival integral nationalists like ante starcevic . curiously the same histories orbins were serbianized through the translations of sava vladislavic which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of jovan rajic and were bulgarianized in the history of paisij hilandarski . the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more selfcontained. it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan notable selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia for example antun knezevic whose book was published between and .clearly something has happened in the span of ten centuries. pagania zachlumia and terbounia have disappeared. the center of croatia has migrated from the adriatic to the north into medieval slavonia literally slavic land with zagreb at its head. this happened in stages. during the high middle ages the heart of croatia was on the una river now in northwestern bosnia. this territory turkish croatia was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia. during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century the framework of modern croatia emerged in two extended shanksone to the north to modern slavonia the other in the south in modern dalmatia. at the same time the zagreb area which was only dubiously croatian in the early middle ages became the heart of modern croatia.the story of serbia is not much different. serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated dioclea. then it moved to the ibarmorava valleys then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia. it reached the danube only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. and its modern capital belgrade became truly serbian only in the course of karadjordjes uprising in . bosnia too expanded under ban or prorex kulin r. into the donji kraji literally lower lands around the vrbas river and the soli literally salt lands for centuries ottoman then modern tuzla and usora in its present northeastern corner. later on at the height of its power in fourteenth century bosnia expanded into hum herzegovina and the drina river valley. the westernmost regions were inc,0

3535,editor review hey thanks for your review of me at er. i was previously aware of the naming conventions debate. it is a tough topic obviously. i support a fairly common sense approach to the subject. if it deals with politics name it by political entity if it deals with geography name it by place etc. ill stop by the chinese naming conventions page later today and catch up on the recent discussion.i didnt know previously about your project to clean up chinarelated categories. cleaning and reorganizing categories is one of my favorite gnomelike tasks to do on wp. what specific changes did you have in mind?i really should help out more at fac. sometimes i just dont want to read all the way through an article. lazy i know. ill look into conflict mediation too.as for my translation of the chinese redology page i kind of got frustrated because my chinese ability is not quite good enough to do a good translation. english is my native language im only a thirdyear student of chinese. someone else seems to have translated some of the material and put it on our redology page. thanks again for the review hope to work with you soon.,0

3557,skywriter i have tried to be civil with you. i would ask that you return the favor. remember i didnt even write the old lede i picked that as merely being most likely to be noncontroversial. also note that on every single edit page theres a big statement saying if you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it. part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing. its nothing personal.if you see no evidence that kinzers book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran then you did not read the book or the reviews.amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is merely how good one is. but whatever you didnt include a direct mention in the most recent version so lets just drop this. and for about the billionth time since you mention in my edit summary that im criticizing kinzer.... im doing no such thing. im sure the book is very good judging from the review given by the cia history fellow. but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself. people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong so this was not a new revelation.aggression aside snowfire the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address. if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording feel free to bring it here for comment. i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede and now its a windy analysis. got it. but aside from sniping you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing. it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede. there are a million and one possible sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede we have to pick which ones. i have no doubt that your text was sourced it doesnt mean its automatically appropriate for the lede.yes and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. fast and loose with factslet me say it again are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup? do you realize what references are for? its to confirm facts. this fact is obvious and supported by every source including your own so it doesnt particularly matter what it was referenced to. if you want to source it better have a blast but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts.albrights apologyyouve got a point that the linked nytimes article doesnt call it apology. remember i didnt write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than wed like.the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup. however the cias accounting published in three years after the publication of kinzers pathbreaking book must be weighed against the cias destruction of most of its documents related to this coupwait the cia destroyed the documents so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it? that logic doesnt flow. more to the point the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source. i havent read all the shahs men but from your linked book review the one by a notable person not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that too i quote..eisenhower and his secretary of state john foster dulles were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscows machinations.kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen.by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. lastly mossadeqs naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh partys efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions. he seemed almost blithely unaware that prosoviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe. by not reining in irans communists he fell on washingtons enemies list. ....yeah. as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source. also note that dulles is described as moralistic i.e. interested in stopping the communists not greedy / interested in oil. squares with what i know of dulles anyway.the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol,0

3571,thanks very much for the restored toungoo map. borders its close enough but i wish its possible to use increasingly lighter shades. e.g. youve followed the presentday border more or less for the chinese border which i suppose is a reasonable representation of the line of control. but the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. anaukpetlun and thalun controlled some of koshanpye campaigns on top of presentday shan state and east of bhamo though not as extensive or deeper into yunnan as did bayinnaung likewise all the sawbwas in modern kachin state and sawbwas in northern shan state also paid dual tribute. but since its not technically feasible i guess well just have to provide an explanation on this. a number of locations are offsome by a lot. chiang mai ava kyaukse nyangshwe pegu and kale. also please add the cities of nan and chaing saen in lan na. nan was the easternmost possession. chaing saen kyaing thin was the capital of northern lan na. the burmese divided lan na into two.again thanks very much for the help. regards ,0

3610, obviously there is some antiamericanism in canada. this means nothing necessarily with regards to the structure of this article. i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans. and i asked for another side of the story and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. your response here is confusing. as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article not making additions to the article. several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim antiamericanism on the basis of involvement in the middleeast... that doesnt mean its a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries. as far as your sources go you did not comment on the obscurity of them. you have still not properly defended james tagg yes that was me who removed that a year ago. i dont see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or rather inappropriate to add. i read that source left you detailed comments and you said something like dont pov push and reverted my edits. you are not making an argument here. re culture clash in archive again there are two sides to every story. please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed and why do students opinions have so much weight by the way?. but there likely wont be many sources to support this because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldnt exist for a counter argument. nevertheless ill take a look...one last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality and onesideness breaching neutrality. i am not trying to say that what youre saying is not true at all. im sure it is true the the extent that it is. but how much is that? the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article that they should be immediately moved.,0

3614,first i just realized via your question that i could answer here. assuming it saves.yes i finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary? i confess i did not at first even this morning.i realize i made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way. i would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies.what to do differently when groups go after me? write a better wikiquette name several people? go to wpani naming several people? do userrfcs naming several people? that is where i admit i need further advice. since a . year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it i dont know how to defend the recurrent references to it. let me say again it was a stupid overly generalized and exaggerated response but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent. i feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents/issues/etc or stating in detail my current views would be inappropriate even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different pov. but if theres some policy on this that i missed i sure wish people would help me out with that.,0

3619,first off you should not edit the list templates directly as the bot will ignore any changes. also you cannot use vertical pipes anywhere in the syntax other than in separating the template name the section name and the reason otherwise everything messes up. in place use . from the yellow box at the top of my talk page if ive left you a message on your talk page i will watch it for your response so please reply there.i am aware that the bot usually overwrites manual edits as i said i spent hours trying to figure out why following the instructions listed on the rfc page werent producing the results they should have. but when i saw that you had manually edited the list templates i thought perhaps you had disabled the bot until it was working properly.basically youre telling me the syntax that is commonly used throughout wikipedia vertical piping is not valid within the rfc templates? thats messed up. whats even more messed up is the total lack of user instructions that mention that restriction. this has become a nightmare of a process. ,0

3622,minor wording issue about steamboatsim doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence from the navigation section the use of steamboats along the river beginning in ... there is a footnote to this timeline page which phrases it steamboats columbia and lot whitcomb begin regular service on the columbia river. the thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before at least to fort vancouver. the first was the beaver steamship which arrived at ft vancouver in . i thought about rewording the sentence the regular use of steamboats along the river... but that isnt quite right either because the beaver was in regular use even if its operations were not limited to the river. anyway i cant come up with a way to reword this bit especially given the existence of the footnote which does not mention the beaver. so im just mentioning it here. it is a minor point to be sure but symptomatic of an unfortunate us bias present in many history books and web pages. ,0
3623, the bands legacy beggars banquet etc. an anonymous user is repeatedly misreading the guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it. heres the direct quotethe spark for fairport taking this watershed turn was the bands album music from big pink the record that along with bob dylan and the bands basement tapes bootleg brought about a widespread musical volteface in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. among the rock aristocracy its influence was evident in the beatles illfated backtobasics project let it be the rolling stones purple patch that began with beggars banquet and eric claptons decision to call time on cream.the anonymous user takes issue with this statement claiming that music from big pink could not have influenced beggars banquet because of chronology i.e. that the stones were almost done recording the album when big pink came out. but read the statement it does not say that it influenced the recording of banquet but the purple patch that began with... etc. this seems clear to me. i would like to hear some other editors opinions on this matter. thefortyfive ,0
3624,well put. qg very rarely works towards consensus or compromise and goes well beyond attempting to portray his idea of mainstream pov he tries to bury articles in twisted versions of cherry picked sources with no respect to weight to make them look ridiculous. the fact that you think the subjects themselves are ridiculous is not justification for overthetop tendentious editing. i truly am convinced by his editing habits that he and ppdd are one in the same person. an editor that active with such an ownership complex might have multiple usernames. those of you asking for diffs to justify the block seriously just look at any talk page discussion he partakes in.,0

3643,so i hope you will oppose any version of fr that would not have prevented this case as not being fit for purpose. in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have % prevented the ted kennedy incident.i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all. i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare. why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? and any interested observers please stop before you say it these valid concerns with what fr is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant advantage of fr of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles.and to further address the specific example you give maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim when it was added to the article along with another sentences which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax and at worst screams delete me now for being total wpbollocks. we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is % complete bollocks? even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. a systemic failure perhaps?and finally as an admin perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now blocked irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. incidentally the now famous bad account on ted kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article. another systemic failure?im all for criticla analysis of cases fr would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer about the whole model of wikipedia never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations. ,0

3651,kanes secrecy?quote from the articleif the allied campaign were to be completed in red alert the allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of red alert . it should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original tiberian dawn manual which states that nod is an african group in its origin making no mention of the soviet union whatsoever.if the instruction manual was written by gdi then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of nod were. maybe kane planted information stating that it was from africa or maybe it really was from africa and kanes attempts to drum up support in the ussr were unsuccessful. regardless it doesnt seem to conflict especially if it could be established that the manual was a gdi document and therefore biased and uninformed.... please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime. either by clicking on that hyperlink or by visiting an online dictionary. the sooner the better to be perfectly honest. as an aside the changes to the section you indirectly are proposing would translate to a classic example of original research. the sections current content is sourced through the referencing of several different publications and statements of various c development teams rendering it fully verified. ,0

3690,as far as presenting sources are concerned the book the life and exploits of alexander the great sites much more sources in detail than source which i think refers to some sources already referred by others. as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps perhaps not. as far as the author is concerned in my understanding he himself suggested that the story of alexander that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat to these countries then we must not look for the original alexander story. similarly we must not look to the states of greece for it because at the death of alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. one country only could be the birthplace of the alexander story and that country was egypt... i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the alexander story from egypt as authentic which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding. this according to me forms one of the essence of the alexander story and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i dont have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins. at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the alexander story from egypt and not his fanboy fantasies from greece to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.,0

3697, i already know the map from john speed but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoye/suraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors. the deutschen dont call themselves germans germanen or alemanes alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word suryoye/suraye was mistranslated into assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists. do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the th century and in their own words which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity? the syriacorthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate suryoyo with oromoyo in their own words. interestingly the arameans from maalula who are either christian melkites or muslims call their aramaic language/dialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoythaaramoytha which is a result of greekchristian influence on the arameans. the word suryoyo which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites catholics or melkites. nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. even if the word suryoyo derives from assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name. ,0
3698,managing the content of articles when a plant product whether food or other is not in a relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem. here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach theres bound to be some overlap with genus/species articles. this article seems to me about right in its focus on what englishspeakers normally mean by banana namely the food where it comes from what it is how its grown etc. it would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to musa genus perhaps with some crossreferencing so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic but this would be a marginal change. ,0

3710,how this article can shinea big problem here is the lack of references. even stuff that is true needs a reference cause how is the rest of the world going to know whether someone just made it up?here are ways to combat this use information from the schools website. yes the schools website sucks but there is some info there. use information from the local newspapers the trib chron and other local publications. use information from the school newspaper yearbook and literary journal. the great thing about this is students can get things in here that otherwise would go underreported. these all have editorial oversight so they are reliable as far as wikipedia cares. unlike a students blogunbeknownst to many theres also a book all about skyline called skyline sportswriter tim keown is the author he followed around the basketball team. any skyliners interested in improving this page might go check it out at the library ,0

3713,== unblock requests =={{unblock reviewed=sorry for my blurb here i went in detail elsewhere. if an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology they will notice that ive been patient while i had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. that creates a very stressful situation. please see here for outside opinion. i did not use the same kind of language against hrafn and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while i added content to the article. i was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it even before the afd process. i noticed it was a stub and started to add content. how am i being disruptive to other there when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? i even listed potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be an editor of astrotheology and add content. hrafn on the talk page even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. it is obvious he was against something but that something wasnt me like he thought and he couldnt believe otherwise or choose not to. somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment i got from hrafn to where durova stepped in and it went directly to arbcom. she did ask about pastordavid but i looked and i left evidence on an/i of why i didnt accept his offer that is not a refusal to dispute resolution that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an afd. i felt another mentor/mediator would be best. personal attack/comment redacted by if you look however i did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to hrafn about rs/n over the physicotheology book... he didnt answer at all to that question but he went on to despise me instead with more egregious misintrepretations. as for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that durova noted those werent because of disruptive editing. i never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. if you seriously think i did it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. the previous mediation was recommended by a mentor comments redacted by i hate the show the mistakes she made also we arent allknowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? the computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why i got blocked before. after unblock the consensus continued and it still sustains today. if i truly was trying to disrupt like durova claims dont you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. comment redacted by it would be a test to see if she requests unblock but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again i really doubted her olive branch. i deleted a section here on my talk page of her vanish forever bit. i simply did not reply to her comment redacted by you can argue all you want that i changed the section title which policy does allow for neutral view comments redacted by when arbcom said this is obvious i truly dont think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help offer to help mediate. i saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides pastordavids. however i sent an email to ask her why... why.. why..... but now she is calling it obscene and offers to show it to any admin. if you read itcomment redacted by like i said on an/i...decline=reason — not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words the gd word primarily to his opponents. i see no reason to unblock. the consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle and the community has handled. june ,0

3799,well there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarnos words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia uk etc. but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the gs forces and those loyal to suharto. im of the opinion that the period of combat was brief and that after jakarta was seized by nasutionsuharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence why the pkis central committeein exile called it just a white terror. but of course however the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to maos peoples war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict. hence i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations.by i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to reestablish the party. unfortunately it is without copyright information printed this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the u.s. cold war. i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war. at any rate toodles. ,0

3826,great but what i meant about weakest link is that i dont see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources ive seen have you got a source that places something called postindustrial in the context of the history of noise music? im presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag.unless the sources are good on this its too divergent in my opinion to include right now. some of what might be called postindustrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesnt warrant inclusion. you might as well do a section on deathmetal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music.personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composer/artist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i dont think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and thats why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. we now see a number of artists for example jeff mills being redefined as a postindustrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now. i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic. ,0

3903,hi tim shuba. your above claims violate wptruth wpnpov and wpreliable sources. prof. frank j. tiplers omega point theory has been peerreviewed and published in a number of the worlds leading physics journals. even nasa itself has peerreviewed his omega point theory and found it correct according to the known laws of physics. see my above post at may utc for the details on these matters. no refutation of it exists within the peerreviewed scientific literature or anywhere else for that matter. when it comes to editorship on wikipedia its not up to you to decide whether something is true or not as that violates wptruth.,0

3926,i understand the confusion. you would think that since a primary source is a firsthand account it would be the most reliable. however the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. also there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. thats when a secondary source comes in. a secondary sources author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion evaluation and/or conclusion. furthermore secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. it helps us avoid original research. one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions whether intentionally or not which would be considered original research. you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wprs and wpsource. ,0

3940,wait you added this to the article??? for starters this definition of eroticait is the depiction of sexual acts pure and simplehas no citation. who came up with this definition? because it is pretty much a crock as far as im concerned. what about the notion of suggestion which seems the major distincton between erotica and pornography. by the definition you chose to attribute a depiction of an individual in a suggestive pose ie not a sexual act is exempt from being called erotica . while i respect the need for clarity here i think this current definition misses the mark.why not refer to a dictionary definition and leave pov out of it.thank you.,0

3961,no i will make sure that will be removed permanently. i will not do this for awhile to avoid violations but hope that someone else will consider and agree. there is no reason whatsoever to put the late in front of his name i will list several reasons and although i think that is somewhat pov there are other reason as to why i remove the infoeveryone dies sometime does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put the late in front of everyone that has died?poor writing its just sloppy/filler writing to put the late in place. would you ever see anyone referred to as the late in a print encyclopedia?recentism wp has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective. would it make sense years down the road to still refer to him as the late? lets make things as static as possible.precedent at one point several dozen articles referred to steve irwin as the late steve irwin now this is the only one that does by doing a search and there seems to be consensus about that.knowledge of his death lets face it a vast majority of people especially those that would look for this article know he is dead and the few that may not be sure can click the link. maybe people dont want to know that hes dead or be reminded of it and putting that acts as a spoiler. even anna nicole smith had a few the lates put on pages of hers and those have all been removed a few by me a few by others. saving a click is not a valid reason for this we should assume that the readers are smart and things like that can go to the simple english edition.irrelevance why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming? his shows will probably be reran for many years to come and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.well this is my case i would also like to point out wpown which i feel has been violated in these reverts. i also am starting a discussion on wpwords to avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that i am doing the right thing. i am supremely confident that i am and i look forward to improving the peta article in the future. ,0

3994,danny your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again. as the wikipedia page says . . .you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets this does not provide as much information to readers but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website and none of the watchtowers multiple links no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. as for the links to quotes websites they are extremely encyclopaedic and the page has no commentary but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage rather than just a few selective quotes. they are all given their source publication date and page numbers for proof and reference. your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing. you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesnt suit your agenda not dissimilar to your religious organisation. i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months you feel the desperate need to hide accurate comprehensive dated quotes direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society? if you can give all the publications from the watchtowers website then im sure many here will be only to happy to list that link but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on . you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site merely saying its not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality and your desperate urged to manipulate the public. posted central august ,0

4013,i cant quite figure it out. the system of numbering dynasties was developed by manetho in the thirtieth dynasty so it isnt often applied to later dynasties. but it looks like the second period of achamenid rule following the thirtieth dynasty is sometimes called the thirtyfirst dynasty. one might count the ptolemies as the thirtysecond dynasty but i dont know if any reliable sources do so. theyre either called the ptolemaic dynasty or the ptolemies or the lagides. and counting them as number instead of would ignore the argead dynasty alexander the great his son alexander iv of macedon and philip iii arrhidaeus which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties. i cant see any reason for counting the ptolemies as number . unless sources address the issue i think attempts to give the ptolemies a number should be left out of the article. ,0

4015,i dont have desperately strong opinions about what should be included other than the two most widely recognised songs of lennons solo career. however it seems to me that anyone who does have such an opinion ought first to make the case for whichever songs they want include on the talk page in order to gain consensus if any can be reached. on that understanding does it seem reasonable to trim the paragraph and leave a note in the article to direct people to the talk page?,0

4022,you know what forget it. the guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why except of course to start shouting has reported me for not being civil. how ironic is that. rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better ill simply point out that in the current version even after you read the entire first paragraph you still dont have a clue why this article exists. you do find out what marco rodríguez does for a living though. so yay for that. i guess once you get to the end you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal but thats assuming you havent fallen asleep or shot yourself having read the same four words brazil germany biggest loss and their million variants multiple times. seriously if people here think whats currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. its not quite garbage but its not good. and please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are unencyclopedic frankly you couldnt be more wrong. theres no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match both now and in years time. if you dont want it to be in this one please think of a better reason than unencyclopedic if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.that said on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article heres what the opening should look like if youre trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.brazil – germany was the shock result of the first semifinal of the fifa world cup mens international football tournament played on july at the estádio mineirão in belo horizonte brazil. it broke brazils match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to and equalled their biggest margin of defeat tied with a – loss to uruguay in leading it to be described as a national humiliation. the game also saw germany score the most goals in world cup history their overtaking brazils . their second goal meant germanys miroslav klose reached world cup goals overtaking brazils ronaldo as the tournaments alltime record goalscorer. the game was subsequently referred to by the press as the mineirazo evoking the spirit of the maracanazo in which brazil unexpectedly lost the fifa world cup on home soil to uruguay.,0

4025,dude seriously you need to relax a bit. life isn’t all about research and fact hunting. you went crazy when you saw a hoax page and did hours of research into it. it was a blatant hoax and it was just a childish game which you got involved in. i hope you’re happy that you spotted the hoax but anyone could have done it. you even got your friend on the case to do research into it i agree that wikipedia has no place for rubbish but it’s the administrator’s job to delete the rubbish. i think at the end of the day youve got to have fun and researching about some fake person isnt the way to do it. i think to a degree everyone’s idea of fun is different but almost everyone in this world will agree that what you did wasnt it. i’d prefer to play scrabble with arabic letters than research into a prank if you want a debate then i’ll be on my user page i always enjoy having chats with you that is fun,0
4026, my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion page....l nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear salvioyou have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period.may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az seric and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds.there is a constant undermining of the city´s greek identity i.e. whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army.the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. on the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled trnc.it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture w.r.t the city. the trnc is illegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus. this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character.this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.in the light of all of this i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self. furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory.marcobadotti talk ,0
4027,so his summaries werent as antagonistic. so whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning. good to know. on to your second claim i still dont understand how i have a pattern of edit warring but olyeller doesnt when i added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence and olyeller repeatedly removed it for no valid reason and olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page. so its odd that falsifying summaries isnt considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. the only reason olyeller removed it is because he has a really big anticarbonator grudge. i once called him a thinskinned prick and he took it badly. he now confirms the validity of said appellation by obsessively searching for any of my edits and reverting them which is exactly what he did in this case. how is that not vandalism? ,0

4037, request regarding current rfar/clarification there is an open request for clarification regarding a sanction decided at wikipediaarbitration/requests/case/abdwilliam m. connolley see live link or permanent link. is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. i agree with him and unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised i support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. my reason for this it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at rfar/clarification and that i was blocked while this request was pending for comments made in the request itself is an additional impediment.there is no need for extra debate or argument. i have stated that i am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which i interpreted the sanction pending clarification by arbcomm. so the status quo is that the restriction is tight though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. i do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits and id argue that he did so consider. i accepted sandsteins decision clarification as a neutral administrator pending arbcomm review not future perfects who was already involved and i had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.i will continue to respect sandsteins tightening as standing and binding on me and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated and it did permit legitimate comment before arbcomm when i am an originating party as is normal. normally i can having filed respond there to comments from other editors also made there which is what i did. arbcomm specifically allowed me to originate a case and if im clearly involved as well i see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.i will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors and i will avoid in such a filing if it happens unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. obviously if i file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin i will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required which would only mention other disputes peripherally and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.i hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual rfar than there has been to the existing rfar/clarification which as it stands includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material i filed. its been pointed out by with clerk attention requested and nothing was done. nevertheless if the request is closed without action its moot. the real point here is that if clerks were following filings before arbcomm surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved and possibly the editor warned. ,0

4096,what vandalism? jibba jabba you have two. btw what vandalism? communicator/kills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo? the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise. the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts. however the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots. obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time. ... dlomme //yup. communicator/kills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting. is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl? who cares? and believe me im no patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum. this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur. actually protection is not something to be taken lightly. being an admin and even though i am a diehard pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos. . farive nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere. protection this article is starting to get vandilized again. if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected. i wonder why vandilism is returning to it. get over it people the superbowls over so you want me to request semiprotection? communicator/kills bias?? the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots. whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given. when it gets to the part about the patriots winning superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them. ie under belichick the team went to three super bowls in four years... it should be consistant one way or the other.the sentence the patriots however were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii after winning the first games of their season. is very clumsily tacked on to the first section. i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev,0

4098,indeed “learning curve.” i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully off i wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like arbcom’s wiki. that wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path. that took some reading and trial error. mediawiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan. it’s—like—about openness. ♬” the thing is those who don’t care to think about security wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing. however those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by i.p. then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what i did to file. like many things i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki. moreover installing imagemagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using ftp it’s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like templatext template template/doc templatehilite templatenbhyph templatenowrap and templatext. i think i have all the gottahaves now. i was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so i’m fond of them.i can’t complain about free stuff. mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $. i’ll take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day.,0

4124,well i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article. it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress. i have two problems first it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in to science as a specifically western project. second although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge the history of science is rather more complicated than that.one way to deal with this if others find my criticisms valid is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck etc on the one hand and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other. for example i think everyone agrees that aristotle newton einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims. id hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of say thomas kuhn and bruno latour could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously as well as the claims of those with opposing views.i am glad ed has begun this article it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. sr,0

4198,cleanest city it is surprising that trivandrum is out of . but that surely is not a good ranking. like aarem suggested being in the top deserves to be called one of the cleanest. also cleanliness is not just about clean it is about pollution waste treatment etc. i suggest that one of the cleanest should be removed.best airport i am not sure what this means. this tag was given well before the new terminal was inaugurated. i cannot understand how one could rate the old trv terminals as one of the best if looks is the yardstick heremost of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals. also the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport in terms of revenue traffic profits passenger traffic facilities? if you would like to retain it please be more specific and of course have the references ready.cheapest and closest option i would suggest rephrasing this to one of the closest options to maldives and sri lanka and the only direct option to maldives. you can always use a connecting flight is what i am trying to say. for instance someone in the uae can fly to colombo and catch a flight from there to mv. mountainwhiskey ,0
4199,first off i am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. i dont know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. as a life long resident of miller having both parents from miller i am well aware of the boundaries of miller. and your account is false...also i am not talking of this original town of miller or is supposed boundaries but the miller beach area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call miller beach a neighborhood of gary makes the very notion of miller smaller than it really is... i dont have agenda here. i just dont want my home town slighted by misinformation. it is the word neighborhood that is of issue. miller beach has several neighborhoods... it was settled almost years before gary was established. it is town that has been annexed. it is not a neighborhood of gary. it existed before gary. these are historical facts. is miller under the municipal control of the city of gary? yes...is it an area within the political boundaries of gary yes... is it part of gary? no,0
4200,senior descendant of victoria albert? is he really the senior maleline dynastic descendant of victoria albert? prince richard duke of gloucester is the most senior maleline male descendant of victoria albert as he is the surviving son of prince henry duke of gloucester and as the dukes two elder brothers edward and albert who reigned as george vi had no sons is since the death of his elder brother william in the senior maleline male grandchild of george v who was the surviving son of edward vii the first son of victoria albert. prince andreas is a descendant of leopold duke of albany who was victoria and alberts fourth son and edward viis youngest brother. thus he cant be considered as the senior maleline descendant of victoria and albert but through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of coburg by the future edward vii and the prince arthur duke of connaught he is the current titular duke and thus is with no doubt the head of the house of saxecoburg and gotha. nonethelles his british cousins from the windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. we can say that prince andreas is the senior maleline descendant of prince albert in right of the former realm of saxecoburg and gotha as the elder lines of his descendants thourgh edward vii and arthur duke of connaught now extinct in maleline renounced their rights to it but definitely he is not prince alberts senior maleline descendant in general.,0

4216,the removed paragraph slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization which happened mainly after the ausgleich compromise of . while no one now considers magyarization a positive trend for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratici have removed this paragraph not because i would necessarily disagree but because this is a speculative formulation a pov in wikipedia terminology not suitable for an encyclopaedia. if this was an undisputed topic maybe such formulations could work but since that is not the case it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data. ,0

4220, response to third opinion requesthi im here to give your third opinion. i think its important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions. its not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards. it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused. theres no dash key on my keyboard. i know how to make a dash however —. but i do web dev and work for a printing company. and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and. i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and im writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page. so in my mind the question is whether this is a misconception or just ignorance. i believe that to properly call something a misconception it must be believed to be a rule when in fact such a rule is not correct. ive never heard anyone say just use hyphens for everything. it has only become the default because we have no dash keys. so i would lean toward excluding this entry unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes not just misconceptions. hope this helps. ,0

4222,i was just released from prison on december . during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike. actually and / days started pounds ended up an estimated pounds. generally i drank two cups of milk in the morning and drank water as needed. i was never forcefed. nor oddly enough was i ever hungry or in appreciable discomfort. i was examined almost daily by prison medical staff. probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the bodys electrolytes calcium potassium sodium magnesium phosphate and to consume just enough aminoacids to supply neurotransmitters. if you merely drink water after a couple weeks youll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance and youll feel terrible. most people attribute this to not eating but i learned that its actually due to the electrolyte imbalance not the lack of calories. at the time the longest hunger strike id ever heard of was referred to in the capote book in cold blood by perry smith in the early s days. i could probably have gone two more months. ,0

4258, i feel like i cant improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved the person i said it to and who did the block hours after the conversation was over. if as said that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong. when i posted that message and i still havent heard from the block admin that its content was the issue i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal human to human level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person rather than having us both resort to the standard drawnout wikiprocedures. so far at least onwiki that editor has had no reaction to what i said while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions and me only able to appeal on this page.,0

4279, this is weird... thanks for improving the article ayaka asai which i created together with tomoyo kurosawa and moe toyota a few months ago. i noticed a very odd error though her agency profile says that she had a role in the pokémon theatrical short pikachu and its eevee friends as glacia glaceon. as a pokémon fan myself i immediately noticed some discrepancies this website and the movie credits give the voice actress for the said role as akeno watanabe itself an article needing immediate attention. im confused in fact the said role was included in my edit that created the article but as you can see with this edit i removed it for the reasons i mentioned above. could the agency have made a mistake? tccsdnew ,0

4310,there are many inaccurate statements being posted here. far too many i dont have time to correct all of them. the bnp was modernised by nick griffin and has no links to holocaust denial or nazism. digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant. you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories. during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that? another example the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis. so they went from being antidrug to prodrug. the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial. secondly the comment about nick griffin and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antibnpers. what nick actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden. likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the nazis. also the last claim modern bnp members sieg heil i presume was a comical claim. it has no basis in fact. bnp are strongly against nazism and fascism. if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. is that democratic? you might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently.,0

4337,the books of maccabees and the gospels refer to the land and nation as israel throughout this period and the term is still used in acts. the hasmonean kingdom was certainly not called judaea as this ia a latinized name and the hasmoneans are prior to the roman period. similarly as explained in the article it was only after herod the great that the roman expanded the usage of their term judaea to include more or less the entire region that herod had ruled. maccabees and the nt are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as israel for a modern academic publication secondary source see for example king herod a persecuted persecutor a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography by aryeh kasher eliezer witztum walter de gruyter where herod is clearly referred to as king of israel and e.g. a survey of israels history by leon james wood david obrien zondervan which refers to the hasmonean ruling over israel or say the holocaust roots history and aftermath david crowe westview press which similarly speaks of hasmonean israel. ,0

4401, may utcas far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore. thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the crossover connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology. as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe only star wars takes place in an entirely different futurepast element basically a universe that predates that of the earth. and tolkiens universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm the same applies to dungeons dragons world of warcraft and warhammer. however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c.s. lewis and hans christian anderson/brothers grimm. harry potters world also doesnt tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen. and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tiein is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesnt the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present. perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole. piecraft ,0

4403,so far nobodys reverted me so that gives me hope. meantime let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. in recent years wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers clients and others considering doing business with someone. naturally the one doing the vetting has the lions share of responsibility in judging an entrys reliability and supplementing it with other research. that said do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents as far as possible an accurate wellrounded picture of the subject? in the case of ms. caesar i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny. what are your thoughts? ,0

4426, musings hey fridaywhile blocked the past two days i read through your subpages. things like /admin etc. they are greatim burning out on this project editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past ive received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me. i also saw that im not the only one whos been on the receiving end of this. ive seen it all but its too long to go into here. im not sure if these are new trends or just something i havent spent the time to look into before. mere editors really have little recourse in this. filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past. it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an outofline editor. filing against an admin would i assume be much much worse. admins seem to behave like innercity police with their wall of silence.a lot of your comments show that youve noticed the same happenings. in an ideal world i think you are right people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen. i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies. we need to define what something like disruption is. when someone is blocked for a personal attack the diff should be included. that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change weve tried the trust admins to do what is right. it has failed. ,0

4429, and use the confusing redundent yet common phrase north america... not refering to the continent. either of two reasonsa desire to place the united states last on the list by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find.simply an oversight. well nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u.n. subregions. its amazing that this list puts the united states last even though it has most of the people and / of the area. is someone trying to deemphasize americas importance? no its just in alphabetical order. talk about... any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states?? yes in the human geography section namely the rd paragraph. other related terms are also treated in that sxn. talk central americans are not north americans we are own people and we are not northerners. we are seperate from them and are nothing like them you can try to correct me but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down and sometimes other ignorant groups of people. i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this. i dont care what the white man tells us. theyre not us. we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be. this is just another way of bringing us down. i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us. if we have been living here for the longest time should it not be us who decides who we want to be? tito a. martĩnezthis is a lovely essay but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling. central america happens to be located in north america so central americans are north americans its a geographical thing not a cultural thing. perhaps youre thinking of latin america and anglo america? actually tito can undeclare himself. if youll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america you will see that spanish language defines north americas southernmost country as mexico. esnorteamérica redirects to esamérica del norte which lists the lists the following political units in north to south ordergreenlandcanadaunited statesmexiconote that central america is not on this listwilyd is also right as far as english language goes. north america includes mexico and central america. i think america terminology should provide a better explanation than it currently does. a section on english vs. spanish terminology would help. i dont speak spanish but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. maybe ill recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this. okay but ill claim the fatal flaw here is this américa del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america. tito may not be a norteamericano although i dont think he declares himself here either doesnt spanish have an equivilent to lacademie? but hes still north american. actually i dont think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans. his country if its in central america is a part of the north american continent but the cultural division is what hes concerned about. want to help me update america terminology? i think america terminology reflects correct english usage. maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints although im actively involved in that article and know itll get shot down as original research. roughly speaking there arent political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america not that im convinced the term exists in contrast,0

4440, may utcprince felix of schwarzenburg is at the right location. his uncle and then his cousin was the fürst while felixs position all of his life was that of a prinz this distinction is tougher for families where all used fürst like wrede and also titles like herzog and graf but it is easily determined. i am as certain as you are about alfred iii because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals other than the heinrichs reuss were the heads of houses and families. friedrich johannes jacob celestin von schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway he was zu not von. he was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also the prince john adolph ii. i dont mind leaving the german von or zu for princes of territories if the title isnt used. for instance felix zu schwarzenburg and prince felix of schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. adolph von auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source i have gives adolphs title as fürst which wouldnt make sense. i would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. prince karl of auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the fürst but again i would ask on the page. charles ,0

4456, why is the lingo/doublespeak/racist word contractors used instead of the precise english word mercenaries this is an encyclopedia not a press release.wikipedia is not supposed to be the house organ of any one government but this article uses a lingo/doublespeak/racist term that the usa uses to describe mercenaries of any country other than a predominantly caucasian political ally.wikipedia should be filtering out spin words an translating them into proper english.i suggest that contractor only be used for unarmed nonmilitary nonpolice contractors.this simple rule should apply if the term mercenary would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an african government the term mercenary should be used to describe the job or person working for a nonafrican government.end the racism. speak in plain english. this is an encyclopedia not a press release.... ,0
4457, recap i decided to withhold further comment until i had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. i am delaying a trip this morning so that i can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.your supporting statement for deletion is as follows the result was delete. the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic and i have counted those opinions as being from userjulie dancer. kevin talk as for the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm... in reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance. within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by at that other algorithms exist namely examples of relevant works are a fast bottomup decision tree pruning algorithm with nearoptimal generalization and an efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees. which are capable of performing the function the article title namesif this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.in anticipation of these other algorithms being added i immediately changed the body of the text to read the algorithm used for this purpose... to one algorithm used for this purpose... since i do not now have access to the articles history as the result of your deletion i can not give you the exact date and time. however it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. incidentally it has been suggested by a professor at cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.normally as a wikipedia user i would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the wikipedia was setup this way. the wikipedia still claims to be ...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. the impression i have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. they simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. as for ...references not supporting the notability of the subject you can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. all of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which i deferred. just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. i know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.as for the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... this shows you did not read or comprehend the response i made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. i explained that each of the user names were created so that i could track the use of my own resources better similar to the need on the part of the wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots but currently i am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the wikipedia and mining it off line.since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w,0

4471,just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.in some cases it is probably appropriate and actually used just like a surname in a legitimate but different broader sense than that used by our surname article and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere by the person. thats probably especially true of radio personalities with an onair name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name ive seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names. but as a general rule no. some like annmargret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. the problem of course is that our articles especially the stubs and substubs often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on. if it is mary lou or something of the sort common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself it should clearly be under m in any category the redirect which should be there or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful. but in between there is a huge variety that youll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories and there are lots of them. even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesnt even appear in the articles own name. ,0

4480, npov dispute just so this isnt lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article. in my interpretation the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrases usage and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. also generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov. the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version we should go through the diff line by line. did someone ever justify those massive changes? though some of them were good. t ,0

4496,response to the disappearance of madeleine mccanni reverted your edit because you give partial information not because of the wording i prefer. what parts do not make sense? the ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? stop saying it is bad english if it was just that youd fix it without removing information.garcia added that when the pj is criticized then the british police are also criticized because of their close cooperation what you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the portuguese article it is not just close cooperation it was created a joint working group right from the start with the british police. this is why the british police are also criticized. just close cooperation they have with the interpol the europol and other police organizations. no working group was created with them. i hope it is clear. several unfair critics were made to the methodology used by the portuguese police. garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by portuguese and british police. other facts indirectly related to the different methodologypersonnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as forging evidence he gonçalo amaral was the victim of personal attacks by the british media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman but also attacked him as a human being. portugal has unsolved cases of missing children under including madeleine.in spite of all the resources available and the different methodology the uk has unsolved cases of missing children under in the last four years.national missing persons bureau. it seems that the british methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. besides thisthe uk has a serious problem with child trafficking a serious problem with african children that just go missing no criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the control risks group hired by the mcanns since may. the investigation of the pj weve stated all along has the most likely chance of us finding her something made them change their minds?the use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with childrens abduction and trafficking that the uk has. i hope it was clearly written and the parts of it do not make sense start to make sense.i am going to revert the edit you are welcome to correct any bad english not the information.i am sure my portuguese is better than yours. ,0

4528,the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. i would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. i.e. “situational factors such as luck compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like i mentioned above. maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words i.e. change “social perceiver” > “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. instead of a “in the real world” i would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. this would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. overall i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate. aside from the few things that i’ve mentioned i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting.,0

4576,ndpaffiliatedi added a fact tag to the fourtimesreinserted modifier ndpaffiliated to the mention of bill tieleman other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty nor are publishers such as canwest which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the bc liberal party also one of the partys major financial contributors. its not that tieleman isnt an ndper but his credentials go beyond his ndp politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party also. im responding partly also to this edit by . ive puzzled long and hard over my own realworld coi on bc political articles but i see no reason to recuse myself from participation in bc political articles though generally i give them as wide a berth as possible but when i recognize pov political activity/wording as a responsible wikipedian i cant not say something about it or challenge the povism and coi/spin edits when i see them. my interest here is to prevent wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine of any party and to make sure wikipedia principles are observed particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect wikipedia guidelines or concepts like wpnpov. in the case of this item about bc rail theres lots missing including the search of the clarkmarrissen home during the opening of the investigation and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case. but theres also lots of other commentators particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like sean holman laila yuile and bc mary who have similarly spoken out about clarks involvement in the bc rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public and of the informed media. she may have been out of teh way for the hst fracas and the big media have pronounced her clean of that but he big media also have maintained a veil of silence over bc rail. the current text says that she resigned for family reasons but its wellcitable that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the bc rail affair. and about the tieleman thing unless every time conservativeaffiliated columnists or bc liberalaffiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims often false its not fair to single out tieleman for this thats the reason for the cite tag tielemans own byline says only bill tieleman is one of bcs best known communicators political commentators and strategists. bill writes a politics column tuesdays in hours newspaper and the tyee online magazine. bill has been communications director in the b.c. premiers office and at the bc federation of labour. bill owns west star communications a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour business nonprofits and government. and frankly seeing whats going on with the ndp and teh things the party council/james supporter types have been calling him he may not be ndpaffiliated much longer.... ,0

4587, ive come across variations on draughts as ive always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variationsdammspiel thats what the manual called it i think its also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue.turkish checkers similar settup to dammspiel/damenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares youd use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules.one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts dagger draughts or kings.played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts.i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man cant take a king. apparently according to this page thats the rules in italian draughts.,0

4604,=colorb>coldplay expért lets talk this talk page is for discussing the article not world war ii history in general. summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences. my edit stating that as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement. this is not stalins arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the abraham lincoln brigade. prior to the francobritish assisted nazi sudetenland grab relations between nazi germany and soviet union were icy. when the nazis were declaring war on czechoslovakia the ussr was hard at work putting together an antinazi coalition. only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked antislavic aggression did the soviets begin to look for other allies. there is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event. this is not a motive its a statement of facts. if there are no more objections i will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect. respectfully disagree. the statement as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically. one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antihitlers coalition. another school believes that the only stalins aim was the alliance with hitler. the third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory. the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars. we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. we have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources hitlers occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr uk and france and could lead to signing of antihitler triple alliance. in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. had chamberlain and stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had ribbentrop been little bit less active wwii could be this is not a motive its a statement of facts. no. all these facts had already been in the article before your edits. your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote. in addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. try to follow this unwritten rule. that saves a lot of time and efforts. as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events. what nick said also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia ussr would have intervened as well. ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia. ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert. after the seizure of czechoslovakia the ussr held the uk partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the french as allies. if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

4608, a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi. lately ive seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man. i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people. he seems to spread his antipolish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazism in europe and racism against poles. he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation. thank you so much for taking care of him and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. however now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different. this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of nazi germany war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi crimes against the polish nation invasion of poland collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazism and race untermensch master race white supremacy racial hygiene nuremberg laws aryan race aryanization aryan paragraph honorary aryan white nationalism holocaust victims racialsegregation nazi germany persecution of black people in nazi germany occupation of poland – polish decrees kidnapping of children by nazi germany forced labour under german rule during world war ii extermination through labor antipolish sentiment antislavic sentiment polish question polish joke ahnenpass anschluss lebensraum rassenschande adolf hitler nazism racism scientific racism themes in nazi propaganda germanisation reverse racism relations between nazi germany and the arab world glossary of nazi germanythis guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or nonaryans by the nazis. in fact the only aryanlooking poles that were accepted by nazi germany at the time were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like .% of the whole nation. the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the naziruled nation and were treated only slightly better that the jews. this guy he spreads lies all across wikipedia therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions diannaa. if youd need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed just tell me. i will also try to patrol the articles about poles. ,0
4609,sir my meager edits were factual direct authors quotes and in context. docs edits were and remain out of context and reflect that he never read the articles he is mentioning which puts the procedure in a negative light. i am sorry to ask but have you read the information to see the actual facts? vandalism by the wiki definition speaks to the repetitive introduction of inaccurate information for no constructive purpose. please review my posts and show me what was inaccurate or out of context. i am not afraid to admit when i am wrong. i have had a number of physicians and lay people review the history and they were also amazed and dismayed as i was. you need to stop making this personal and focus on the published facts otherwise wiki as a resource is doomed. finally i am the just the last in a long line of contributors both individuals and corporations that have questioned his motives and accuracy. questions make many feel uncomfortable. i have also privately shared my exact written comments to doc with some colleagues both in the us the eu and canada and i was told by everyone that i was spot on. sorry again for all the trouble.,0
4610, good policy suggestion on class assignments. my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. i think your looks like a good idea and i support it. its especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced thoughtful edits to psychology articles here as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. keep up the good work. talk an appology is in order dear colini am not sure if you will have the chance to read this or if youll have a moment to respond but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article. however before i go any further may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. i will not try to make excuses for my actions nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them. i realise and no doubt others will too that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t. and most importantly i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. though i can understand where you are coming from i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the longrun. i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge please do not blackout our privaleges to use and edit articles. let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school. looking to make this a better placecivcodex thanks. we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia. what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate. talk · contribs · email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page. °talk proposed new policy id like to advertise this very draft proposed new policy . comments please. °talk i think the central dillema is this a student could make a poorquality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. if the grading rubric was accurate a student would receive or negative credit. my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment increase their wikipedia knowedge and improve the grading rubrics themselves. im fairly proud of education programsaint louis university/signal transduction sp which i helped write. you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re how the community reacts to profs and students. the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies in the first place and we are often more unkind than necessary in the second. i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt. –  + barnstars { style=border px solid gray backgroundcolor fdfferowspan= valign=middle rowspan= style=fontsize xlarge padding verticalalign middle height .em the barnstar,0

4620,i looked at the vandalism page and i have not vandalized the big o and dukes page.vandalism is any addition removal or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of wikipedia. the most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor page blanking or the insertion of nonsense into articles.any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism. even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. for example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — its just not helpful and should be removed or restated. not all vandalism is obvious nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial detrimental but well intended or outright vandalism.committing blatant vandalism violates wikipedia policy. if you find that another user has vandalized wikipedia you should revert the changes and warn the user see below for specific instructions. users who vandalize wikipedia repeatedly despite warnings to stop should be reported to wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism and administrators may block them.,0
4621,as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to. it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in not polesti. raf bomber command used an attack by the af to attack this target.the days loses were as already given. specifically spitfire claims were not discussed so the spitfires percentage of the kill total is unknown which is conveyed in the article.more importantly citations have been given for for the order of battle figures. your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. oob are given in lists as you should know so your give me a quote tone is rather silly. caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. he gives known strength returns. as for total german day fighter strength again this estimated by caldwell as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete. he points out and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september . in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time while alone were available for combat in the west. german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time. even considering that all e.f fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts negating even the med. theatre. so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false. ,0

4628,the sims expansion and stuff packs listing together? since the good article review suggested that the sims expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing my question is this if we decide to split the sims games i.e. core game with expansion and stuff packs onto one listing should we remove the sims stuff packs article and merge it into a new article with core / expansion pack / stuff pack article listing? i think the core / expansion pack / stuff pack article is wise and thus eliminating the stuff pack article in my honest opinion because we dont need two lists of stuff packs. so this is a public vote and note the good article review is in the archive article page see archive list above for link. sundogs talk page sandbox,0

4634, narciso yepes please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. yepes collaborated with ramirez not bernabe to invent his guitar. bernabe an apprentice of ramirez later formed his own shop and yepes subsequently played a bernabe string. as for your comment about yepess hands this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of yepes. i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available depending on what best served the music. do you have these proofs??? no. so please stick to what you actually know. fyi yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first strings d together with the low g on the th string by using the left hand thumb. again we have the proof of this. it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... your discussion at narciso yepes first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for yepess death. and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious...second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and yepes invented his tenstring guitar. as i said bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then but the first yepestype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar. moreover ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar. this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical. it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings. you want a verifiable source? here ramirez iii jose. . the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar. bold strummer. pp. . isbn third i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar. furthermore yepes frequently uses the th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor th higher than the th string. moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions. being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepess entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. this has nothing to do with yepess own performance practice on his instrument. as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepess leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about. yepes even frets a and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing.,0

4644,dear wikinews wikipedia since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise and/or contribute. for example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia? this is a conflict of interest. another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including “blackpearl “svtcobra” “chris mann” and “whoville” own disney stock have gone to any disney theme park watch disney movies and/or buy disney products? then “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest. does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses? then this is a conflict of interest. what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” don’t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates? as documented volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards. thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.wikipedia and wikinews editors dont follow wikinews own written polices... “do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news. you even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion. you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue. wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it. incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims. are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well? they proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such. wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute. its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating. yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control. if you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more.. does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?,0

4713,users are cautioned to assume good faith and to recall that all new users must start off somewhere. further many people with expertise in a specific area quite reasonably make contributions within that area alone.there is of course nothing inherently wrong with singlepurpose accounts wiki discussion policy cautions against personal criticism.if you are going to assume the mantle of editorial arbitor and enforcer then it is your responsibilty to ensure the article is accurate. controversial subjects are by definition controversial. that is the nature of paul wolfowitz. the article as presently edited is biased in two respects a through its uncited inclusions including the one noted above and b through its omissions. there is a direct relationship between wolfowitzs departure from sais and his removal from the world bank. readers would not gain that information the way the article is currently presented. you are invited take the factual material that you deleted and to conform it but there needs to be a context to the section entitled recent controversies. ,0
4714,i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of töbel here it comes dear val who is also a mormon or a parrots aint surei found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. i think that the person concern storm rider is grown up enough to do so on its own. unless next time i am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. it could be interesting. if you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to dont know what to say. so do the wisest just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand. all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light. i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. as for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie what about you? are you val? or are you rama? or are you dgl there is a lot of nick name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name. they are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous. so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo i will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.so what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own? i had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and i dont feel to make it again or take another. following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees hahaha and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule? it is all a lie. how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? it isnt equality it is power struggle. it is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here. wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equalityha ha make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic. for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first. i speak languages english danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek of them fluently the others as pocket use. like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm. as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. in europe from age we choose between languages english german and spanish at age we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew. to languages are part of the compulsory pensum. i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in india. that was for learning,0

4725, free software / open source in many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source. the best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. if you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term i have no objection. if the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. if the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license excluding the gnu gpl. its text explicitly uses the term free software then its ok to use that description. the purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case. unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis.if you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better. ,0

4744,thanks for the speedy reply and the links. after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit perhaps in a table form that can be added too or removed as needed rather than a vague catch all description.for example after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldnt be done alone. aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. im not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didnt really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.,0

4779, henrietta van laer says no. its not that having an agenda at all is a problem for wikipedia. wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda prosocialists liberals greens and gays determined to vilify and demonize conservatives. it is a completely biassed source. its articles on socalled leftwing parties are blatant whitewash while those on socalled rightwing parties are nothing but vilification most of it based on flimsy thirdhand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. instead of detailing their policies wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.pov in wikispeak = different pov to us the wikipolice. i also get the impression that wikipeople are pretty young. there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. how naive can you get? i dont know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average. naturally they are inclined to vote labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a rightwing taxcutting party. many of them earn two or three times the average wage and like the fat cats they get generous pensionpackages too. added to the votes of the millions of people who live longterm on state benefits this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honestjoe workers or lowpaid. but wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics with a poster of che guevara on the wall his hair streaming in the wind.,0

4802,hi again dearyes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people.and about azerbaijanis are turks or not. despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk turks of west branchoghuzstarted to come but infact it is not important when they came here. the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani and not azeri which is an invented word by persians turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang. as same as turks of turkey. you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see. it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not turk you dont know who you are i know you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean. pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not. about aran as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era. we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep. and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan. aran was part of this big land. but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep. former aran as you called are of my race and we r same nation. you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks. you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves. if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language which does not exist ok lets think azerbaijanis r not turk so what they r? azeri? ok lets call them azeri what is the next step? you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian? or not speak azeri lang.? so what is azeri lang.? where is it? can you learn it to about million people? lets thing pragmatic as well as rational. even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of years ago nor persian.also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. one was paniranist other was panturkist. some of their researches looks really funnyabout the names of turkish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan. if you were here youll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name? ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan. most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian. my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats armenians and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays. they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc. which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk. i dont know what they want us to feel in tehranthe name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well. this word cant change to azarbaijan during history. i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it nowi had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well. the diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know. whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty,0

4832,i think it is both a khmer character and a tamil character then. the problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly but that it did not represent the sound w like the other characters in the logo. the khmer character does not represent w either. talk according to wikipediawikipedia logosalphabets represented in the logo they do represent the letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the english w as in wikipedia.however according to nohat at user talknohat/archive trouble in all the logos only some of the symbols were selected to represent wikipedia— others were chosen at random. and threads at user talknohat/archive say the same thing. angela says the same thing in metatalkmain page/archives//error in the wikipedia globe. zocky repeats it at talkmain page/archive wrong devnagari symbol for wi in wikipedias logo. the only remaining tiny flaw i can see in your logo thue is the topright piece klingon r is lacking any depth there should be a black edge to the piece but instead we see the grey of the inside. not very important at all though. ah i and the person who reported the problem with the tamil/khmer character thought that all the characters should represent w. but that is obviously not the case. imo the klingon r is within stylistic freedom so i guess the logo is correct now. when at first you dont succeed redefine success . talk acousmatic hi there you suggested a merger but you did not start a discussion i think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. instead i would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to acousmatic sound so that the page can function as a subsecion of acousmatic music which is a particular form of electroacoustic music one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. the acousmatic sound article might focus more on schaefers and chions theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context. ,0

4869,this article is being rewritten at jack abramoff/abramoffrefactor. please take note of the existing notes and outline and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. comments welcome. thanks archives archive friday th august talkjack abramoff/archive i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. copyviothis article and its sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia. theyre essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal. both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia. they need to be deleted immediately. alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio. tyco as below was edited the text was accurate but half the news story was pasted in here. you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story attribute a link and it not be a copywrite violation. its called plagerism. tyco almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article. ive removed part of it as it needs to be rewritten. i think ive cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up hopefully. there is alot of nonessential stuff in this article about peripheral people and not about abramoff however. it needs to be cleaned up more as the article meanders alot here and there. i reverted some things you took out outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about delay. that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted. it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it. just providing a link is not attribution and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism not fair use unless you are quoting. also if you are going to say the los angeles times reports you need to source the times not a secondary source i.e. democracy now.i modified the quote and attributed properly. the speech from tom delay is a direct quote its in quotations so of course it is taken wordforword from the source. ill tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. heres the primary source for the other thing. no problem. if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first and then rework it i dont usually just leave it out if the quote is accurate. btw have you found a link for the franken quote i cant find anything other than on blogs. honestly im not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is really anyway. the forced abortions part was originally reported by brian ross at abc news for / on march . it also appears in al frankens book the truth with jokes in the tom delay saipan sex tour and jack abramoff casino getaway chapter. since weve agreed that primary sources are key ive change the attribution in the article. the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed norquist etc pages to it.basically we need fewer facts and more context. at the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. i moved the whole scandal to its own page. this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players in particular ralph reed. i am not doing this to hide the scandal i think that people looking for info on i,0

4876,shockedi am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an eb account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information. that opinion took a nosedive today when i came across this article in wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection. if i want to find out about bose headphones or any other product i will go to their web site i dont expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia. one can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader. the fact is i dont care whether this so called article is written from a npov or not whether its balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not i do care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if its a fact it somehow deserves a place here. i can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that i dont want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list.,0

4964,hi goodday i have noted that qwyrxian has weighed in on the issue. i have learned to appreciate his steady advice on matters and suggest that you ask qwyrxian about this as well. regarding the number debate i dont have strong feelings on this either way. if you do the drn process can do no harm and would be quite useful imo. if you want my involvement i would be pleased to help. i became aware of joyce banda through this conflict in the past and have grown to admire her leadership. anything to help the article about her is of interest to me.,0

4971,btw true opinion is fact. is an academic statement take any college level intro to logic course. evolution is a fact sadly in todays age in the public eye often enuf described as an opinion. in the end i would say evolution is common knowledge. such doubt begs epistemological parameters but i concede this point may be a redherring. may i mention that kyle hosted the eisners xs ? due to his wit personality ? or penchant for telling jokes q.v. that others seemed q.v. to be amused by due to repeated spasms of their diaphragm. although the spasms could have been due to the food served theoretically merely a synchronistic anomaly in time space ? i obviously do not have the knowledge of other editors like tenebrae on comics he probly knows where to verify this. ,0
4972,with over college students studying abroad every year theres bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around. while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.misconception studying abroad is very expensive.truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad. lets say the tuition at your school is $ per semester and room and board is another $. now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry. you are now well over $ for the semester. well all but one of our programs in spain is under $ per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.tabmisconception i cant use my financial aid to study abroad.truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans pell grants etc. can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well. it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money.truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program. the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had. if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends. since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year its a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. misconception ill be so busy with schoolwork that i wont get time to see the country im in.truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about + photos from a long list of countries. students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad.truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then its true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad. if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine. the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.misconception most of the world hates americans so i wont be safe.truth theres no doubt that there are a lot of people who dont like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people. if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous. there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe. go to the u.s. state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.studying abroad is a onceinalifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of. before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts. i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you youll be hopping the first flight abroad.one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad. here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countriesstudy abroad spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid salamanca and sevilla. study abroad england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london. study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence. study abroad france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aixenprovence and avignon. ,0

5046,yes i agree wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now. vitali has considered fighting huck after huck defends his cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching chisora. he wants to fight haye but haye wants to much money to make it happen clearly hes trying to cash out. that might be it for his career. since other pp boxers have more sections i dont see the issue with adding more for vitali. but we can decide that in the future after his next fight. for now there is only the chisora fight. given the slap in the prefight conference spitting in wladimirs face before the fight and brawling with haye in the postconference i think this is worthy of a headline. its also one of the most defining fights of vitalis career as he won it at an old age with only one arm.,0

5048,no doubt. it is a very good article as of today.,0
5049,with all respect i dont know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around. i dont think this is the way to make people feel welcome on wikipedia. chussid should not make personal attacks but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history. any normal person in chussids position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed. indeed. and the reasons they give are totally outrageous. these same people do consider which also does not give any names or an address of the persons behind it a reliable source. because it fits in their zionist thinking pattern. jaz does not. if you ever wanted to know what jews who oppose zionism go through you are having a nice view of it right now. incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting. just because youre bothered about something does not give you the right to cross the boundaries of civility. a discussion can be heated and honest without being incivil and thats what we require here. ∇∆∇∆ ,0

5129,i actually hadnt even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization audio that you both have proposed. i could make the issue a little more complicated though graphic equalizer not yet written smiley face curve parametric equalization and british eq all have to do with what ill call music equalization for lack of a better term. this includes sections and of the current equalization filter along with possible future articles tone controls loudness control combine with smiley face speaker equalization etc. oh im certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles but could as well be topics in one article except that a few of these already exist separately. the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer but has become the accepted term since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someones taste not strictly to compensate for a channels frequency response.then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization or some such term which would include section of equalization filter telecommunications lines riaa equalization fm pre/deemphasis as well as equalization of nonaudio channels this is the orginal meaning of equalization. such equalizers are generally nonadjustable by a user at least and transparent to the end user. so i call it a different subject even when it is audio. anyway i dont have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems. though id be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues. come to think of it i dont have to ask for permission ,0

5132, the article is mostly about the pound in general with no mass/force distinction due its historical treatment as a weight. perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic pound article and pound mass should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system in this case the pound mass is a member of the fps gravitational system of units. there should be a link to the pound mass article from the pound article of course but it deserves no better treatment than the lb of the fps engineering system. there is a table of the fps systems at poundforce and at slug mass which tabulates various fps systems. its a little less clear than it used to be what was simply called fps engineering is now engineering absolute and the fps gravitational system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the engineering gravitational system which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to newtons nd law. where did the gravitational system come from? maybe some reliable sources are in order.,0

5134,edits by keraunoshi keraunos. i see you added to and rearranged some of this article. i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. but actually that isnt physically accurate. the universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy. where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear i.e. the universes taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. hence i went ahead and cut this edit of yours.if people read further into the body of the article under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free. you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.i kept the ressurection link. i understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar. the term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means. you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to tipler will occur between x ^ and x ^ years from now in proper time.one should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of artificial intelligence ai as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate. hence im changing this to from that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term.i also removed your quote of tiplers estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his book the physics of immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on. so tiplers current estimation is different now. for more on that seef. j. tipler the structure of the world from pure numbers reports on progress in physics vol. no. april pp. . see also here. also released as feynmanweinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything arxiv. april . you added the section criticism from string theory.i kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. i changed the section title to implications from string theory since brian greene doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to tiplers omega point theory in greenes book that you referenced.this section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under wikipedias rule concerning original research. as its written its a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction. you moved the see also section to underneath the references. you also added a number of links therein.based upon wikipedias featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously before the references. hence i moved it back. i removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce,0

5136, the less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is british irish isles. believe when i say that the manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the u.k. as a protected and supported territory republic of ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the u.k.did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the british isles. place names reflect current realities thus we have istanbul and not constantinople. a better example would be the aegean coast of turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the greek coast and all the islands were greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the turkish state has jurisdiction the only islands which are now greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of greece. if you were to rebut by saying that british refers to something more than a political term but rather than an ethnic or geographical one then the same argument or even a better one can be made of greek. the greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient greece e.g. southern italy sicily turkey armenia etc and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated greek are ethnically and linguistically greek but live in the state of turkey and therefore the islands and coast are turkish. thus you could not refer to the island of ireland as british.,0

5138,title of article in english wikipedia this morning a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full vietnamese diacritics. i just moved it back to the version without diacritics for the following reasons this is the englishlanguage article about ngo and the great majority of english text written about ngo and other vietnamese generally do not include diacritics. in english in fact inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect at best or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard english orthography. please note i am by no means an englishlanguage bigot i am a student of the vietnamese language and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in vietnamese. however it is clear that in english the diacritics play no role in pronunciation. the wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in english is the form that should be used. apr utc,0

5140,for the record larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that universal wasnt going to go anywhere with the galactica franchise. it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on universals part to do anything with commander cain and the pegasus and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis which was built by the th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth. the film would have dealt with the search a major battle with the cylons and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth all w/o involving the galactica or the rtf other than being mentioned.the first article google shows is this one . and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although im not sure about whether theres some wikirule about referencing other miniwikis. the john larocque article on the attempt is at . hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort but seeing as how their site has a lot of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware ill quote it here to save your systemsin the spring of it was announced that glen larson was making plans to bring galactica to the silver screen. impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander larson paired with its producer todd moyer on an estimated $ million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg. the story picked up where the series left off but followed the exploits of commander cain and the battlestar pegasus made famous in the original series episode the living legend guest starring the late lloyd bridges. in the concept commander cains search for the lost battlestar galactica leads him to contemporary earth which according to the story was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar atlantis.special effects were to be handled by moyers company no prisoners dfx utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander. moyer planned to update some of galacticas ships including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkersà la the transformerswhen on planet surfaces. moreover he and larson planned to expand the galactica franchise to include an imax film a theme ride and a new line of merchandise.then as quickly as it had been announced the project vanished from the radar screen. it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues. it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar galactica were still in some dispute. in either case the project disappeared into the ethers.iirc had a page on this at one time but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared. ,0

5148,moncrief do you even know what a shepherd is? i used to work on a cattle ranch so i know a bit about this stuff. to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep usually in flocks in the fields... unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others. the s werent biblical times. shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that downandout laborers got when they could get it. in fact thats an important part of proulxs story characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. afterwards ennis worked with cattle and jack worked most of his life in an office job not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark. however the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer the summer that so defined them. therefore id say that the relevant description especially in this paragraph discussing that summer would be shepherds. that however is more up for debate. i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. although anybody whos ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that thats just a circumlocution for shepherd. but since i dont want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page ill settle for that as a compromise. chris ,0
5149, wpfilm coordinator hey i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wpfilm concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. im a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. is it largely updating reviewing articles and aiding in the establishment of task forces at least as far as i can see? do coordinators generally specialize in various areas i.e. one handles task forces others reviewing or a combination of any such duties? if so i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status. if i was elected i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wpfilms scope and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort. that said i understand that im relatively new to the film project and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project. just curious as to your thoughts on the matter. cheers converse ,0

5191, the importance of khalifman...and of anand ponomariov kazimzhinov and topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for fide...cannot be overstated. they represent the rule of law the functioning of the world title cycle at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle as it had been from onward. to say that fischer kasparov or alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of khalifmans title reign. one could say that fischer kasparov and alkehine were stronger than euwe and smyslov too...but that doesnt get us anywhere. we dont rank us presidents by reputation we list them all equally yes? khalifman himself in in interviews said that although he was not the strongest player in the world being th by rating...he was clearly the world champion having won the title in the open public cycle run by fide. that stand that position is what makes his title reign important. btw before anyone denigrates the fide title champions ...it should be noted that at least two could be considered supergms anand and topalov and that one anand regained the title via the classical method. chesspride ... ,0

5194,ekantik do you believe that sathya sai baba can miraculously transform his genitals? i would appreciate an answer.i also find it amusing that ekantik of all people is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by sai devotees when ekantik is a hare krishna congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord krishna literally manifested seperate human forms married seperate women copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. sanjay also believes that lord krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord vishnu a male transformed himself into a woman mohini devi. so it appears that ekantik and sai devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. i cant help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.funny how ekantik and andries critics of sathya sai baba want to promote well sourced stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference written by a doctor in a well known sri lankan newspaper is not well sourced. this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions. good luck wikisunn. you see what you are up against? talkemail ,0

5197,list of ice hockey teams in ontario i updated templateohl and templatedefunct ohl to try to simplify things. templateohl contains all teams past and current for the ohl. templatedefunct ohl contains all past teams from the omjhl and the oha junior a. that template may need to be renamed. regarding the article list of ice hockey teams in ontario. how should we handle the defunct teams from the ohl omjhl and oha junior a? that is a really good question. i would like to add them as it would allow the list to be both complete and consistant with the others. i havent added defunct jr a teams on any other article but many of these oha jr a teams were the highest level of junior hockey at the time i believe so should be added as being equivalent of majorjunior. however that will likely make this a really long list. it might make sense to split the article into two active and defunct as i did with the baseball lists. i would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets then deciding from there. if we hope to get it to featured list status as i would like for all then we cant use the template as a part of the article itself.,0

5248,well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wpdbad here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here i mean the talkinternational recognition of kosovo page. as far as the wprm if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure im still not sure that there is one. moreover im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed. persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wparbmac probation this article is under the scope of. concerning the closure of proposal. im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wprm. actually i find wprm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wprm but then i might misunderstood something. i might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter. hus as a formalist as i consider you at the moment i must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. i suppose i pointed out one might consider ive used irony i apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least. maybe some other place exists which im not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself. not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action ? / . sorry for that.ijanderson you asked why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia? well actually i do consider this title is biased also. but personally i consider the irok more globally important not just to me as one might think it is. if the bias is dealt with this issue irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also. and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place > maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea.all the best. s talk ,0

5252, september utci love how i specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission. your line response was the equivalent of nananana booboo as far as i am concerned. lets dissect these lines.you dont understand propaganda.that is a loaded statement if i ever read one. i have read up on the term propaganda thanks very much and my readings are not simply limited to this website which i feel is narrow in its scope. i have been on a program that toured the death camps of poland and studied the use of propaganda in nazi germany. i am currently awaiting a response from a phd who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry and it is with respect to our point of contention here. funny i cant find any work you have done on this subject mr. jensen yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. i have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. you use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.i am not denouncing advertising for products i consider harmful and this is what you need to understand because i have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. this statement you have just made is a personal attack. additionally it is incorrect. i dont consider the product to be harmful. it is harmful. this is not an opinion but a restating of facts by the iarc/who and health organizations worldwide based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. if it were simply an opinion i can understand why you could be frustrated. but the irony mr. jensen is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer among other health risks please take the time i urge you to read any or all of the references i quoted in my submission all from established medical journals. the industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant says that uv exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed not proven whatsoever and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven e.g. cancer prevention base tan exaggerated and can be achieved through safer means e.g. vitamin d exposure. so please enlighten me mr jensen as to what propaganda is? is propaganda not a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?. thats the definition on the wiki page right? i am sure you have head of a systematic review that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. it is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. well thats what i use and thats what the world health organization used when they came to an unbiased conclusion that uv exposure from tanning beds as well as the sun is a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes. in my submission i think i clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points including the systematic reviews i mention. is this not the same as presenting one side of an argument to influence the attitude of the community? or is it that as you say i just dont understand propaganda? i have to say it yet again to you because i think this is such an important point that i have to drive home this is not my opinion. tanning beds cause more harm than good fact. tanning industry sites present the good which is partly true and negate the bad partly false and this is also a fact. if you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of good business its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product and the result is advertising that is propaganda. the industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics e.g. suggesting that cancer society and neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children blaming o,0

5264,personally i think many of the disputes could be resolved if we had some consistency in what is and what isnt to be said about politicians and that is more than anything a structural issue with wikipedia that probably has also been dealt with extensively in other wikis concerning perhaps george bush. perhaps we can should be looking there for guidance as to how the community has dealt with the issue.basically what we have is one camp who wants to tar grant devine/brad wall with sourced and referenced bad stuff but goes and eliminates the sourced and referenced bad stuff written about lorne calvert and other figures in ndp administrations. and we have another camp that does the opposite and an edit war is the ultimate result.,0

5269,i dont want to reopen the issue as the issue was never actually solved. wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic and childrens books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count. instead of just blind reverting changes id like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources. whenever a source is in question it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some peoples bias against editors who arent signed in. these changes were badly needed and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wpowns the article and others who violated wpagf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good. ,0

5326, basic income dispute resolution i dont understand the finding futile or how to proceed to resolve the issue. regarding the wikipediabicyclesandwagons reference its my understanding that i am building a bicycle that may be slightly off spec and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec. i point out also that the basic income is listed as a priority by four wikigroups and so it is a pretty important bicycle. also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability imo but regardless of this opinion a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed. to keep the bicycles/wagons analogy the page was a high quality bicycle and an important bicycle to wikigroups. there is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away. ,0

5330,=== page is in rough shape ===with the recent purge of content the page is not as informative as it once was. the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed. one editor may appear to hate since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog. also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog. meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content. for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work and the link to reciprocity is not online and the topic not a major issue. both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available.in order to be bold i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content including from sources that are not government funded. basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening. barring this broadened content eligibility we all need guidance for what is eligible content and perhaps what makes ineligible. the content there was written in and has been adopted whether independently or without attribution by other authorshere is the major recent deletion . specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced. some of these can be sourced elsewhere but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy dont spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do. basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients or find and punish abusers. basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions such as social security in the us is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation. balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work. better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up. smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction. viewed this way the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation. social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically with less requirement on charity and welfare. it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income. its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner. natural finances definition of social dividends variable basic income tax revenue surplus over social program expenses essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic productivity and automation growth. the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.,0

5372, utcan interesting comment convict leasing isnt the same as slavery where theres ownership and title. however i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery...true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. one ended w/ the th amendment and the other was legalised under the th amendment not the corwin amendment of . in other words what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause? wwhat do you think they were referring to? futhermore i dont see a problem including this in the article so long as it is a small reference and not the focus of the article. as to scholarship there is reputable work on this and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business plantations mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. yes they were mostly black. the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery though not chattel. this was systematic and went on until ww though todays version is slightly different. now some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. slavery by another name by douglas blackmon who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic. thats the point. this is far from original research and there are other scholars whove written about it. now i havent edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here but id like to know the issue as it is now. how do other editors feel? one other thing american historians do not always agree on things and i have noticed at least one conspicious neoconfederate argument in the article unsourced though on a different part of the article. so yes its important to look at historians but on some topics theres a whole lot of rubbish particularly w/ slavery issues so a consensus by historians may never happen and sadly ideological agendas do exist and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources. id say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important. july,0

5422,ok obiwan. youre starting to make me suspicious. what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions? own up. either way you did not answer my question directly and i also suspect you know it. does this mean that wpo is not useful to you? but you did answer it indirectly. so you get an even more direct question in return why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? for one you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. if you dont mind im going to take this straight to the source wpo peeps what the dealio? ive asked people on wp to put up or shut up. ive asked the wmf to walk their talk. in fact ive staked my rep several times now and im not done yet. now im asking you why dont you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? onwiki or off obiwan certainly isnt the first to question your selfrighteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia. i for one have been wondering for a while now. so lets see what you can do besides making snarky personal comments. heres a pot and heres a kettle. need i mention what color they are?onwards with obiwans points. i dont believe in nasty people. deciding anyone is bad nasty etc. has only one purpose one can feel better about being bad nasty etc. to people theyve so judged. i dont think this is particularly productive. in fact imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides or more often others have convinced them that they themselves are bad people. we could talk about this more in another thread but weve got to get back on topic here so. . . you know that the wikipediocrats are smart. you have spent more time there than youre willing to admit directly. i immediately wonder if its just in reading or in writing too. they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoningwise that ive met so far. but emotionally. . . less than average. how do you think many of these smart mer fers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? a lot of them fell from grace not because they werent an asset to the community but because they didnt seem to know when or they were completely unwilling to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. thats one part of the answer many of them are banned or blocked whether rightly so or not from editing on wikipedia. also its normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. youll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. frankly we could speculate about these peoples motives and methods til the sun goes down. lets be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here. what we as a wikipedia community cant do is ignore them away. and even if we could were doing a pisspoor job of it because i almost always hear about whats been said on wikipediocracy from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site. ultimately i go back to my old standard i dont give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are alls i know is that they are saying something interesting and i appreciate the fact that i dont have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it. obiwan no use playing coy. you know exactly what im talking about. d ,0

5436, wester civ hello i had gotten an email from one of western civs fans asking why they dont have a wikipedia page. i remembered that there had been one at one point in time so i traced it back to you. i am not an active wiki user so i do hope you forgive my lack of knowledge on how this works. i have read the reason for deletion and i have also read all of the criteria that must be met by a band to be considered notable. if i read the deletion log correctly i see that the reason for deletion was listed as expired prod borderline dbband that said i am including as references in this message links to their three published albums a list of press garnered and links to some of their fan pages online. if you google the words western civ the band is the second and third return on google. i do believe that these elements are all examples of notability as wikipedia defines it for music. since the page western civ is simply being used to redirect people to the western culture article at the moment i do hope you will reestablish this page to its original form as a wiki for the band western civreferenceslink to western civs published workslink to western civs media press kit which includes of over published reviews and articles about western civ as well as a partial list of fm stations that are playing western civs musiclinks to western civs websites please let me know where to go from here. ill be looking forward to speaking with you further.thank you manager western civ,0

5440,the ezekiel passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclopædidia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to yahweh along with jeremiah .. both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable. the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god. it is cited in encyclopædia britannica moloch with the comment note also the attitude of ezekiel in xx. seq. references which cannot be explained away. the article the international standard bible encyclopedia molech moloch treats it rather strangely remarkingthat this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live ezekiel given by god to his people by way of deception and judicial punishment as some hold is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.it is not clear what this means quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold. this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to yahweh. it also brings in bogus molochworship in connection to carthage. not a good article in any case.three different rabbinical interpretations of the ezekiel passage appear at . the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning disliked by trs but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. that would not be a reason to suppress rashis interpretation and the writer does not do so.there is a discussion at which covers in part john days treatment favorably but also discusses the ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the peoples belief and apparently ezekiels beliefs that commands which ezekiel saw as bad came from yahweh. note john day believes moloch is not yahweh but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.in short the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by yahweh. it has long been in general a problem pasage. but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response which seems to me weak. but add it with a citation if you will. but do not suppress.the inclusion is not editorializing by me. i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. the ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to yahweh and normally used as support for that argument indeed one of the main sources for that argument. my own pov as much as i have one is that the evidence is confused there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to yahweh. even when when that interpretation is rejected the ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.i dont believe that anything i have included in this article including the ezekiel passage is nonstandard for discussion of moloch. i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. one obviously cannot agree with all sides. moloch cannot easily be at once yahweh an entirely different god the name of a kind of sacrifice. passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. please let the normal statements used as arguments stand regardless of the positions.i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound,0

5518,so what if konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers? thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category. dualpane behaviour is part of konquerors functionality not its whole functionality. you can play textmode tetris from within emacs. would you categorize emacs as a tetris clone?as for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management à la classic macintosh finder. they certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches. so it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there. besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software. but again youre missing the point as ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is usage of the term in qualified circles. ,0
5519, after looking at a few sources it seems that you are correct. ive changed the article to reflect this. talkcontribs ,0
5520,if the nazis meant reich as empire they could have made that clear by translating it that way in englishlanguage material they produced. they did not do so. they always used reich in english translations. for one of many examples see this page it is the official german government translation of a hitler speech. note that reich is always reich. the nazis did not consider frederick the great as having anything to do with the first reich. they did view him as a great german. the problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be a very accurate translation. wikipedia does not depend on what editors think it depends on what they can support with reliable sources. you have yet to provide a single reliable source that supports your point. i and others have provided quite a few supporting the opposite. ,0
5521,thats your pov last time i saw the general assembly of the united nations there was an ambassador representing a former yugoslav republic of macedonia. also an entity describing itself as the former yugoslav republic of macedonia recently applied to join the eu. this countrys self identifying name obviously varies according to the circumstances. it has two official names out of which one fyrom ranks higher in a google search see above. this is a legitimate term and is not a breach of npov its not possible npov is not based on names but on presentation of the facts using either name the article is capable of being neutral as long as what is actually going on is told in an unbiased way.,0
5522,blackpearll calls herself evidently mrs. johnny depp and pirate lordess and such. she celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia. why would someone devote so much time to / check the site and on these pages? has her judgement become impaired? her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear. that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral. sorry if your feelings are hurt but if one purchases products such as pirates of the caribbean posters toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.,0
5523,actually the format of titling appears to be dl on the cover in the orange bar at the top only. on both the cover and the title page advanced dungeons dragons dragonlance official game adventure dragons of ice douglas nilesthey are not called modules anywhere in the official titling though this term is still used to refere to them in dragon mag and in each other for example dragons of mystery page . i have no problem with aerie of the slave lords as this is a clear title for this series that does not need to be distinguished from anything else. clearly dragonlance is not available though if the modules had not spawned numerous other products it may be the title that would have been used. dragonlance modules is not specific enough.i am still inclined towards dl dragonlance modules. my second choice at this time is not on your list but very similar to some there dragonlance modules dl series. ,0

5525, the size of wim crusios wiki page as of december nd the wim crusio wiki page constituted bytes of information where as the wiki page for ernest rutherford the father nuclear physics and winner of the nobel prize only has a wiki page of bytes as of december nd and maurice wilkins who won the nobel prize for his codiscovery of the structure of dna has a wiki page of only bytes while elizabeth blackburn who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in has only bytes on her wiki page. i could add many more names of nobel prize winners but if you wish to do so please feel free to compare the amount of information in wim crusios wki page to that of most nobel prize winners. i just thought i would point this fact out to the wiki community and ask for your comments on win crusios wiki page. please comment on weather you think it is too large and perhaps should be reviewed or if you think the wiki pages of ernest rutherford and many of his fellow nobel prize winners are simply too small. please feel free to leave your comments below this post.,0

5559, sorry that you feel this way malangali. i dont suppose that i can persuade you but i did try and do my homework. iringa is not offically designated a city at present unlike mwanza dar and arusha you asserted this in the article but it is simply factually incorrect. a seperate question is whether iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the tz governments definition. ok. first i assure you that urban can imply either town or city particularly when contrasted with rural see urban area. i checked two english language travel guides for tanzania both of whom use town. moreover i contacted some tanzanians in iringa who agreed that it was town rather than a city not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in wikipedia just to try and convince you that the town thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint or whatever it is youve decided i am doing. i dont believe in individual ownership of wikipedia articles. however city is not the best word here and its entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. again i regret clashing with you on this and im very happy to discuss and change my mind on things and im glad youve improved this article but im afraid i will not simply agree with whatever you say just because im english and you i presume are a tanzanian. ,0

5575,also depending on the article you will look at the socioeconomic equality reason will vary.the violence was undoubtedly racial. its prime targets were the chinese merchants who have flocked to tibet by road and on a prestigious new train across the roof of the world. the mobs were the losers of lhasa – the poor who seethe with resentment outwitted commercially by chinese traders outgunned by the chinese army and many fear ultimately to be outnumbered by chinese migrants.now this is straight from the horses mouth. the actual western journalist who was there wrote this not some msm that decided to twist the sources words. i thought it was the most npov and fair way to just say they were angry about socioeconomic inequality inflation and fear of becoming a minority in their own city. why is that wrong? its the most concise fair and npov way to state what they were angry about which caused the rioting.,0

5619,youre not acting on a grudge by blocking someone for a month for writing about are well documented truths? blocks arent to be used as punishment. wp says that btw. ive been accused wrongly repeatedly of rr had multiple editors make false statements about me and im the one who is penalized. for that and other reasonsone example that edit you did to my talk page and reverted it after you saw how wrong it was. are why i say administrators are jokes around here. youre not protecting wikipedia but instead protecting yourselves.,0

5625,as posted at regarding a suggested wikipedia regrets the errors regarding the according to format for information cited regarding mediation. this most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why i requested this user be blocked. in addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the nccc article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder. you can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless. ill renew my call for a permanent user and ip range block. loverofart coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature. administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and i assure you that they are out of the norm for the project. i encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation. if you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken. philippe talk ugly personal attacks you approve??good morning philippe. the post above yours by loverofart is typical of his posts in my direction. an ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the national civilian community corps by posting false and misleading information at the wikipedia website.if your / wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that i enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with him/her while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. a responsible adult a real editor should have interceded long ago.he/she and the others working over the nccc text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase according to does not belong at wikipedia. as i read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me. it would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case.i appreciate wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. i am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the wikipedia site. your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.a pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues i raise or the attacks on me.pull loverofart out of this situation and i will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the nccc site. i refuse to have further dealings with him/ ,0

5627,hi i just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. i think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. also none of the information under applications is cited. if this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. under references reference list is misspelled. also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. if you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. the analogies in the hologram and holonomy under theory overview was very helpful to understand the concept. ,0

5639,responses i was not referring to this only your posts on wikipediocracy recently. i was not referring to these events dating back to it does not appear relevant to your actions now. i am sure people can refer to the arbcom case for the facts if they wish. i did review the situation with a sitting arbcom member before starting rfa as you are aware. this is the first time i have heard about it. it seems a bit late to be digging this up now. i know nothing about this your page was not even on my watchlist until today. no i was not even aware of revenge nominations. if i ever commented in a dr related to this it was not as part of any pattern and i do not recall ever doing so. i do not watch everything you do on commons nor did i watch everything russavia did. i am not russavia nor do i take responsibility for his actions. if you wish to have my help on commons please leave me a note there. i briefly looked at s contributions to assess if he was active as an otrs volunteer on commons. the copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes shocking for an otrs volunteer granting verification tickets to images. this was selfevident even looking at the first thumbnails some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review it is not like i was deleting them on sight i am leaving the review to others. if you wish to discuss ktrs uploads to commons i suggest that happens on commons.your responses appear to avoid the central issue which is how you are now using wikipediocracy to hound me. you appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. if you have allegations to make please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then i can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.again you are digging through history some of which is years old and the most recent is now years old. it would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud most of which i have forgotten as i have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.thanks ,0

5643, ettlinger being jewish + his family hi alli learned about adrian’s death after a web search yielded this wikipedia article see my post of in memoriam about him to the freecell solving discussions mailing list and since he was a good internet friend of mine and we corresponded extensively on email i’d like to help with the english wikipedia article about him. in any case ettlinger told me in a private email that he was jewish at least by descent he wasn’t an observant/religious jew and said something about being a deist and so i think his article should be added to the american jews by occupation category. one problem i see there is that i dont see any subcategory for jewish american engineers and/or jewish american software developers he was both. i know that richard stallman is a jewish also only by decent american software developer and he belongs to the categories american computer programmers and american jews and there are naturally many others. i have kept most of the emails with him so can upload them in part to my website or elsewhere for citation nut will it be considered a selfreference? so what should be done?adrian also told me about his family two children if i remember correctly and four or five grandchildren all but one are attending university now but i dont think he mentioned any names. should they be mentioned as well?ill try to improve the entry about him in other respects. thanks to all the wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research. ,0

5649,new page patrol hello. thank you for your comments on my talk page. i have thoroughly read all policies. when new page patrolling i tend to do only the blatant vandalism nonsense or otherwise obvious infringements. again thank your for your comments. i would rather you stopped patrolling new pages and concentrated on vandalism instead. theoretically you still dont have the required experience to even enroll at the wpcvua to learn how to do that. borbánya is an example of an article you recently patrolled that is far to complicated for you and which can only be patrolled by an expert. just as an example not only am i possibly one of the most experienced admins but i am also a retired professor of linguistics and it still took me at least minutes to do everything that was needed for that page.,0
5650,editing edits on wiki improve by evolution only the best survives. they become best by change after change after change. i find i make two kinds of edits. ones which add content and ones which improve language. i fancy i am quite good at writing smooth prose but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. if i have a fact to insert or point to make the primary thing is to make or insert it. then someone else can smooth it along or i may do so myself when i have more time or after leaving the piece and rereading it. it can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go because you do not spot your mistakes. as to our last exchange in severus snape yes i agree i put in a clumsy statement but i was trying to express a particular point. you improved the flow but slightly altered my point. i changed it again back a little to my original intention though you also added something. cheers.,0

5675,this is such a fun entry. devotchkai once had a coworker from korea and not only couldnt she tell the difference between usaenglish and british english she had trouble telling the difference between different european languages. kind of keeps things in perspective eh? not suprising. while i can easily tell the difference between french german italian spanish dutch etc. put me in a room with a chinese japanese korean vietnamese and a thai speaker and i probably couldnt tell the difference. if i saw it written id probably have somewhat more luck though. sjkvietnamese has more syllablefinal consonants than japanese i think you can tell them apart that way maybe. is this right? juuitchansomeone suggested heath robinson and rube goldberg as a vocabulary difference. its certainly an interesting parallel but i dont think it really belongs here. they were both artists with their own style and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested. at any rate they cant quite be considered translations because as an adjective rube goldberg is more specific describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions heath robinson in contrast is more surrealistic or fantasyoriented. ldcas an american i would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt a flat is an apartment and rubbish certainly is trash. granted i agree that a fag is not a cigarette and underground is not a subway. i may do some actual research and come back and fiddle with that list. eean.i think americans certainly understand the use of bum for butt rubbish for trash and to a lesser degree flat for apartment. but we dont use those terms much. point to a container for discarded things and an american will say thats a trash can a brit will say thats a rubbish bin. americans are more likely to use rubbish in the sense of bullshit. ldci deleted the following pair limited ltd and incorporated since they actually mean different things. incorporated means a corporation limited means a limited liability corporation you can also have unlimited liability corporations and no liability corporations. british and australian also ltd is roughly equivalent to american llc. sjki would say torch was much more common than pocket lamp which sounds quite oldfashioned. flashlight would be more easily recognised than the latter.yes id call it a torch and it would probably be labeled as a flashlight in its manufacturers packaging. imo torch is colloquial british english the anomeoh so flashlight is correct british usage? my dictionary said am. and the oxford english dictionary carried flashlight only in the meaning of photography. then ill remove the entry again. axelboldt,0

5679,the fact that azeris are mixed turkic speaking people that sprung from the turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear. they were and are in the location that was arran that consistent of albanians and iranian tribes. furthermore the fact that the entire area was called arran then for some reason was renamed azerbaijan is another indication that azeris were not a turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the caucus next to the sakas. no one said azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other iranians in fact iranians are a multiethnic multi lingual group much like the kurds in the west have a different language/customs as do balochies in the south. what happened to iranians in arran intermittingly in which the turks invaded their tribes and the albanians were driven out and imposed their language on them via elite dominance does not change their original ancestry. you have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the azeris came from why they even appear/are part of iran even today and why these ethnic groups even have a persian culture? in all you can concentrate on their differences but fail to explain where did azeris come from? it is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts and write pages of texts about germanic peoples in an article about iranian peoples. i think i’ll stop at that.,0

5728,impumozhi and his knowledge or lack of about rajputs incident impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on hada pageread this page for a little entertainment in particular the last three sentences setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious and probably fictitious incident. is this fit for an encyclopedia? leave aside veracity just the choice of words? yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page it is owned by that presiding deity of obduracy the learned protagonist of every page with a remote rajput connection. impumozhis lack of knowledge exposedhis claim about hadas character being funny and unencyclopaedic is actually taken from james tods annals and antiquities page and volii on the death of the queen joda bae akbar commanded a court mourning and that all might testify a participation in their masters affliction an ordinance was issued that all the rajput chiefs as well as the moslem leaders should shave the moustache and the beard. to secure compliance the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. but when they came to quarters of the hadas in order to remove these tokens of manhood they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. then enemies of rao bhoj hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess who it will be remembered was a rajputani of marwar. akbar forgetting his vassals gallant services commanded that rao bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. he might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. the hadas flew to there arms the camp was thrown into tumult and would have soon presented a wide scene of bloodshed had not the emperor seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the boondi quarters in person. he expressed his admiration he might have said his fear of hada valour alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the rao...if james tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book annals and antiquities of rajasthan what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on wikipedia? incident . deleted the name of famous rajput lady maharani gayatri devi from rajputani page saying she is not a rajput.his response .impumozhi on rajputani page deleted the name of maharani gayatri devi . then he was asked why he did so .his response was countered on his talk page and till date he has not responded. the reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed. incident impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted but is thwarted.in another incident he put a tag of dbnonsense on the article hammir dev chauhan . he was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the csd tag . no reasons given till date. another user had to remove this dbnonsense tag . here again impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the dbnonsense tag.,0

5730,ive been working for some time on categoryroman bridges but you certainly provide new infos here. this is what a webpage says about the alconetar bridge destroyed in the th century arches left moved in i hope they did not change the arch structure then. here the most authoritative photo el puente de alconétar sobre el tajo en garrovillas cáceres cerca de alcántara estaba en la vía de la plata. debió de ser también monumental. fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo xiii y nunca después reconstruido. hoy día es un puente sin río. al construir el pantano de alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. en el año se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. apenas quedan tres arcos de los que tuvo. se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones. as for the pons fabricius there are some roman bridges and even more medieval ones whose arches are designed somewhere between semicircular and segmental. this is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. this means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semicircle character.,0

5809,romanization for words of english originon the mosjp talk page a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of english origin such as fainaru fantajī in for the sake of simplicity i called this case words of english origin more information on semantics here.over the course of a month it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. therefore a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. one suggestion on a compromise has been given already but it has not found unanimous agreement so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.one universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus and you were one of those selected in the process.what this invitation is you should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.what this invitation is not this is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations. this is not a vote on compromises either.it would be highly appreciated if you came over to the mosjp talk page and helped find a solution. thank you in advance. ,0

5818,wikipediarequestsforcomment/historyandgeographythe following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. i trust that philip gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute. rossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam. these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed. one external link links to an article about the th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood. another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. it seems to me that this philip gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for rfa is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam. id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr. gronowski. i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. thank you very much for your consideration. ,0

5871,well lets try again one more time.re commonsenual = wpor. regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation glantz et al. commonsensual is not or. occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete and it is regulated by various international conventions. for instance guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation and one of them refers to something quite unique. therefore we can speak about the occupation sensu stricto and occupation following an armistice. that is what i mean under commonsensual occupation and that is how a reader will understand it.re belligerent occupation i do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way however other sources majority of sources use different terminology. therefore the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. i propose to present both viewpoints you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. therefore it is your arguments that do not hold water.re malksoo please reread his works again. and since both you and i can draw different conclusions from different pieces of malksoos text below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position made specifically for us the baltic sattes were occupied in june and annexed incorporated by the ussr in august . thus both occupation and annexation did happen. the fact of annexation and that the ussr proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own not occupied changed the nature of the occupation if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. for example when moscow olympic games took place the olympic regatta took place in tallinn. this cannot be a typical occupation it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant western opinion and post restored baltic states themselves the soviet annexation remained illegal. in this sense illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudodebate. the annexation since it remained illegal did not create any extra rights to the annexing power the ussr. if the article makes that aspect clear i would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to occupation and annexation of the baltic states. in fact i would recommend such change because it takes more precisely closer to the facts into account the complex nature of the soviet rule in the baltic states.what else do you need? malksoo clearly says that in the case of the baltic states both occupation and annexation took place and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense but not in others. p.s. llegal annexation equals extended occupation. in other words we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the baltic states and i never argued against that. again what synthesis you accuse me in?re there is no bridge between the baltic and soviet/official russian positions there is no inbetween or continuum of scholarship its one or the other wrong. there is a baltic position position of different foreign states which was different from state to state and from time to time positions of scholars western baltic russian soviet positions different during ss and during perestroika and official russian position.re from glantz to malksoo a belligerent occupation. glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the wwii not in the legal aspects malskoo does not consider soviet intervention in as a military operation at all. the only aggressive step according to him was a naval blockade.re baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were colonized probably. however other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the ussr hence extensive influx of migrants. was it possible if they had a colonial status?i expect you to treat my arguments seriously. ,0

5888,it should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including muay thaiwhich mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper bodyboxing as it is calledand many other martial art techniques not exclusive to maui boran or maui tha etc... women are not considered true martial artists anyway. that is because the arts are designed used mastered and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. a womans training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. this is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. it is sad what has happened to karate and tkd in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practionersby way of parents unconditioned elders and women. but that is another debate. regardless female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. like it or not gender is of the physical mental and in my opinion the spiritual as well. play to its strengths not its weaknesses. it is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.,0

5892, please remain civil. you may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article. you keep conflating my changes with those of someone else. the use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and i didnt make that change. you keep reverting all changes wholesale including changes made for reasons purely of style rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you. we have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that bradley manning is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action. you complain about blp but accepting claims about bradley mannings guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious blp policy violation. until the claims of lamo and the us government have been established in a court of law we cannot use the wordofgod to state their claims are true. as for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted. we are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted who clearly states that mannings treatment amounts to torture. ,0

5897,i understand your point. i simply do not believe it to be valid. during the period in question the rc church did not have large armies at its disposal. it relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. in france louis a loyal catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. the rc church at this time were also opposed to this principle one that has become so widely accepted in western societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before. louis with the tactic support of leading churchman ordered acts of antiprotestant terror. lets be completely honest without the tactic approval of the church would a devout catholic have been committed to such a course of action? some leading churchman celebrated the outcome a france almost completely cleansed of protestants. now in all the material the criticism of the rc church is so obviously implied that this shouldnt need reemphasising. a modern historian would not write the following is a criticism of the rc church... that is how junior school children begin their english composition answers ,0

5904,completely new abortion proposal and mediationin light of the seemingly endless disputes over their respective titles a neutral mediator has crafted a proposal to rename the two major abortion articles prolife/antiabortion movement and prochoice/abortion rights movement to completely new names. the idea which is located here is currently open for opinions. as you have been a contributor in the past to at least one of the articles your thoughts on the matter would be appreciated.the hope is that if a consensus can be reached on the article titles the energy that has been spent debating the titles of the articles here and here can be better spent giving both articles some much needed improvement to their content. please take some time to read the proposal and weigh in on the matter. even if your opinion is simple indifference that opinion would be valuable to have posted.,0

5918,{{unblock i am appealing a hour block that was placed on me before i could post my response via the administrators message board. i apologize in advance for the length of this but i believe that its necessary to include all of these details. i wrote a summary at the end so that administrators could get an overview if they dont have time to read the whole statement.i will be addressing the claim that i violated the rr rule in the second paragraph of this article according to wpblp biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subjects privacy... in a book written in a foreign language with a lot of jargon there are often competing translations/interpretations. and a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes misquotes dubious translation and outofcontext statements. as per wpblp i think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used and for the same reason the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.with than in mind on the th of february i improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with wpblp based on this source.userzero responded to one of my edits by stating that i cant read. and in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a wikipedia administrator told me in as many words to get off wikipedia.take a break i didnt take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which i was told by said individual that i had behavioral problems.said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics i started to write a complaint against you why do i need to know that? he can let me know when he posts it and then later responding to another edit he didnt like by saying that it was on my charge sheet.now the reason i am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the rr issueafter posting my version of the paragraph userzero subsequently changed it to this.i will post only the first few words of his statement and the sourcesource there is a reason to kill babies on the enemy sideuserzero babies on the enemy side may be killed .after those first few words userzero continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. now at best this is a serious distortion. and when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing sometimes contradictory sources rationales theories proposals and ideas many of which are subsequently discounted limited in scope or just tossed by the wayside the disparity the statement may be done and there is a reason is even greater.aside from the distortion mentioned above in contradiction to wpblp userzero also opted for a particularly liberal outofcontext translation.why did userzero replace my edit with his own. his statementprefer source with an actual quotationas i showed above he didnt use an actual quotation.furthermore after seeing his comment i searched but wasnt able to find any wikipedia reference to a such a preference leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own wpjustdontlikeit on me without explanation. his actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multipronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in i.e. encouraging me take a break.newlin,0

5922,i think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. so if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldnt be a problem with it? particularly i imagine if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?i read each of the candidates statements and used that to judge if this question would be useful look at the time between asking the candidates questions. also look at the ignore all evidence question this occurred to me as i was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the days question plus this shows it was not a spam question to all candidates i did pay attention to their statements.this is the question i posed to select candidates.what general concerns do you think are raised by the days of silence from the communitys admins in this ani? are there any other general concerns which arise from the ani?do these quotesameliorate add to or amplify concerns?do you agree with the substance of the jehochman quotes?if an essay wpignore all the evidence were written what concerns would be behind it and what could be done about them?if you can point me to another ani where lies and deceit by two admins within an ani were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to days then i will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates substituting this with that example. would that be acceptable?have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? or is this the only one? of course to answer that you would also have to answer can you say in all honesty that you think ruslik did not lie in this ani? if you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self? ,0

5955,new louisville definitionsince the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government. first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. if this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left. second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. third even if suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says. the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city. your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. what you are referring to is the louisvillejefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisvillejefferson county. both are defined separately by the census bureau see here. this article is about the consolidated louisvillejefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated. the confusion lies in the census bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures. although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings. the census bureau has accepted the louisville/ jefferson balance but not the city/county consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses. because of the acceptence of the lou/jef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.your assertion is not entirely correct. the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisvillejefferson county in their estimates. they also include a separate figure for the balance louisville/jefferson countykentuckya louisville/jefferson county balancekentuckyathats from the estimates the last number is the estimated population. this article is not about the balance however. issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page. actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is and not anywhere near . what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed? i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio. we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as or so when the census lists the population as . i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same. however that cannot be done here. an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed. there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article. please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation. since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — userstevietheman,0

5997,de jure simply means in law literally regarding law. according to law the queen is head of state in the commonwealth realms and in the united kingdom. de facto means in fact that is for all practical purposes but not accordingly to law. a de facto head of state would be one who governs practically but without due process of law such as the leader of a coup or a usurper. even when a country is presided over by a person acting as a regent such as the prince regent george who became george iv or a governorgeneral in the commonwealth realms the reigning sovereign remains de jure head of state. please let us not resurrect the awful discussion about who is elizabeth really queen of. it took up pages and created a lot of heat and bad feeling.,0
5998,a copyright violation is blocked yes this has happened but the current situation of wishywashy enforcement results in more people being able to get away with editwarring if they are ‘right’ and more people being blocked because they are ‘wrong’.some have criticised the same thing happening in arbitration cases. those that wheel war on the side of ‘good’ are congratulated or at worst ignored while those on the ‘wrong’ side are desysoped.both applying things strictly and arbitrarily have their pros and cons. on one side you have have idiotic decisions and on the other there is dissent from those that view various interpretations as unfair uneven or incorrect. as the community grows and changes what works best may change. what works best for a small business or a city council may not be the best for a fortune company or a national legislature. needs serious reform // december at am wikipedia used to promote fascist propagandagadgets games at home biztech security connectivity techtips it jobswikipedia sued for ‘aiding neonazis’december ama leftwing german politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia wikipedia for promoting the use of banned nazi symbols in germany.katina schubert a deputy leader of the left party said she had filed the charge with berlin police on the grounds that wikipedia’s german language site contained too much nazi symbolism particularly an article on the hitler youth movement.“the extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education in my view” she told reuters. “this isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion it’s about examining what the limits are.”schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist antisemitic and racist ideologies.“there are signs neonazis are trying to take advantage of such structures and this needs to be stopped in good time” schubert said. “especially given that wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and selfregulating project.”a spokesman for wikimedia deutschland an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in germany rejected the charge.“we don’t really know what ms schubert’s problem is” arne klempert managing director of wikimedia deutschland told reuters. “what’s important is the context the symbols are used in and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”“anyone who tries to prevent the nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world in my view” klempert said. “because that’s the best weapon there is to prevent something like that from happening again.”public display of nazi symbols is illegal in germany but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.“katina schubert fails to grasp the selfregulating mechanisms that work in wikipedia” heiko hilker a left party media expert in saxony’s state parliament said in a statement.“rightwing extremism on the world wide web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings” he added.schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors who would decide whether to open an investigation.klempert said wikipedia’s structure which enables internet users to discuss and edit content ensured no bias arose. “particularly on subjects like the hitler youth you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did show bias” he said.the hitler youth was the nazis’ official youth organisation.reuters,0

6008, suggestions to improve readability hi guys the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read at least thats what i read in the reader comments. i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing. before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money explain the intent of the system missing right now. sthg like it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party that can dictate credit worthiness or price of transactions as in banks or paypal etc.then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description ive read is when a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. bitcoin miners scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger. by morgen peck in ieee spectrum feb a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. another faq from a washington post blog is here and an article days ago about the death of the mt. gox bitcoin exchange by morgen peck was on science friday today is herebitcoin was also discussed on point last november in conjunction with the senate committee hearing about it. ,0

6017,yeah they really exist. you need at least one w one fa from that class and one w one from that class and you can make the others from them a few carnivores species need more. essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition where for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids sugar vitamins and minerals fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as iv formulas. the reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w and you need w and w fatty acids to make lipids the w dha is your most common neural tissue fat. ill see what i can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. there is some quackery out there like pills that contain w because olive oil is cheap but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking actually unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly. btw there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. this destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all pufas. on such a diet even dogs get severe atherosclerosis and they are species highly resistant to it their hdls are higher than their ldls. so all this is quite fascinating. ,0

6035,what i find a bit strange about the various guidelines and faq pages about categories is that while they contain plenty of fascinating details like hinting at the relationship between graph theory and set theory for no apparent reason they dont really come out and actually say what categories are primarily for helping people find things. while this article isnt exactly exclusively about murdered israeli children in the same way that the gaza war and lebanon war‎ articles arent exactly exclusively about children killed by the idf if a reader was looking for the set of articles related to murdered israeli children i think its reasonable to assume that they should be presented with this one rather than not being presented with this one. talk ,0

6111,the titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles. you see the nature of fiction is that its not necessarily coherent. since this article is not about malcolm wilkerson in the first episode of the show malcolm in the middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. for the entire rest of the seven season run the characters name was only malcolm. this is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy. a title like malcolm xxx my appear clumsy but wilkerson is not an alternative. in my opinion. if cant build consensus on this between the two of us i suggest asking for additional input at wikipedia talknaming conventions since i didnt find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although im fairly sure the fact that the characters name was wilkerson only during the first of episodes of the show means that calling the character wilkerson esp. in the title is inaccurate. — ,0
6112,i just read something interesting. apparently there have never been a minority living in this village. this village was always populated with only bulgarians. not albanians or any other. also when the mosque was build in razgrad there was material taken from this village. the sultan of the ottoman empire issued a ferman declaring that no turkish muslim builder working on the mosque will spend the night there. so it is impossible for his to be albanian because there were never albanians in this village. i found this in wikipedia.,0

6118,relevance? in a new zealand tv series presented by rebecca gibney called sensing murder which aired on tvnz beginning in three psychic mediums from australia and new zealand sue nicholson kelvin cruickshank and deb webber armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. the team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains. skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources and it was further satirized in the season finale where host jeremy wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.just how relevant is this? granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show. we are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. if high profile mediums were used i would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.cheers,0

6181,==etymology==this etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many waysthe greek name tigris comes from the old persian word for tiger and means the fast one. it might also be argued to come from kurdish too. in kurdish tir means arrow. this means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.tîjtûj means sharp pointing and cutting. since the letter j doesnt exist in greek tîjtûj became tig later greek at the end of words is sonex is used tîjtijrtigtigrtigris. first of all the persian for tiger is babr not tigr or anything like it. the greek word tigris meaning tiger may be related to persian words within the same family as tigr but that is not the persian meaning of the words.second the kurdish and farsi word for arrow tir comes from middle persian tigr which also means arrow.third the word tij or rather tiz sharp is certainly related to tigr but they belong to the same word family they are not the same word.ill try to come up with something better.,0

6210,i disagree that vowel harmony is the place to discuss imutation in welsh. i see no reason why this article or umlaut and amutation for that matter should be restricted to germanic. i think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid regardless of what language its attested in. likewise amutation shouldnt be restricted to germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well again an example from welsh gwyn white masc. < windos vs. gwen white fem. < windā. umlaut should mostly be about the written sign with an indication that it also the name for processes like imutation and amutation. vowel harmony should be about the lefttoright processes typical of uralic and altaic languages. thats what i think. /comhrá,0

6219,i see that this debate has in any case been preempted by userkotniski who has created and populated the categoryconstituent countries of the united kingdom. in my opinion this is unacceptable as the debate is still in progress indeed it has barely begun and the new category name has the rejected term constituent countries and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main articles name countries of the united kingdom and the term found in most other relevant articles. personally i dont see why wales et al should not be categoried as european countries. i am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here. this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the proper and logical alternative i.e. countries of the united kingdom if the need for it is proven and accepted. ,0

6231,===belated merry christmas and hello from a few submissions on contradictions in indian history pages thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages=dear tiptoetyi request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by user dinesh kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.this communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of wikipedia and nothing else. it has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of wikipedia pages whatever we do users like dinesh kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from pov websites etc. just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the chalukya empires especially with reference to the chola empire pls. also remember that in wikipedia for god knows what reason the pages on the chola empire have been christened as chola dynasty despite that the fact that the cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in india but also overseas including sri lanka maldives very large parts of south east asia for at least years of their existence. here are the examples but before that i would like to say this that deliberately user dinesh kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the chola empire saying that the chola territories were taken over by the pandiyas which has a great weakness the chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from onwards and between / to their kings were displaced and the kalachuris under bijjala i and bijjala ii ruled kannada country in india. the chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just years between to after which they went into oblivion. i request that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the cholas whose kings from ad though were not as strong as their kings between ad yet one of their last great kings kulothunga iii on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied madurai karur and sri lanka then known as ilangai between ad. he ruled for around years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty having hoysalas as his allies. yet even with weak kings following him after the cholas lasted till when their last king lost to the pandiyas and the cholas went into oblivion. contrast the above i.e. the demise of the cholas in or to that of the chalukyas who were first of all without a capital for over years and reemerged for just years and became history by ad or thereabouts. yet jingoism seems to get the better of user dinesh kannambadi and he has written in the western chalukya empire page as under the link is and the relevant portion of text is the following“this period saw the fall of two great empires the chalukyas of the western deccan and the cholas of tamilakam. on the ruins of these two empires were built the kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of deccan history for over a hundred years the pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile chola empire.”though technically speaking at least as per the version of dinesh kannambadi the chalukyas fell and demised in / and the cholas demised after almost decades in about /. i.e. within a hundred years of each other i would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression ”this period saw the fall of two great empires” i mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other then the expression could be a little contemporaneous but even as a weak empire the cholas lasted till almost years after the chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the chalukya dynasty which went into oblivion in the year or ???? the point is that whether it is mentioning the hoysalas another kannada empire or the chalukyas he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the cholas.. even while mentioning chalukya architecture user dinesh kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the cholas see this write u,0
6232, locations thailand.while phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in thailand that includes sex tourism. pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism. i dont know phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more nonsex tourists so if i were going to identify a place in thailand if not the world i would mention pattaya instead and i am tempted to edit. i hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more sex for money going on in pattaya than phuket. but for someone considering the phrase sex tourism as not necessarily pejorative i have to qualify this conclusion. note that bar girls in thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general thai population also. although i beleive that there are words in thai for prostitute they mostly at least the girls prefer to call themselves rented wifes albeit for short time rather then long time. i therefore need to be qualify my pattaya versus phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the longterm married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the wifes direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both. there is no such thing as a free lunch and everybody pays for it. note that i neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing and moreover consider them culturally aware particurlay thailand wise. the fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones one must be aware that labels concepts ideas such as sex tourism carry suggestions associated with religion particularly judeochristiamislamic jdi pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the religious worlds worldviews outside of some tribal village usually buddhist and what i like to call giesha cultures e.g. japan thailand etc versus virgin cultures typically jdi that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. note that thai society is strangely contradictory in this regard arent we all but then thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west. perhaps some historioreligious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also. i hate value laden western and religious labels that dress themselves up psuedoscientificly as culturally universal. exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more exploitation going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like chinese factories where labourers girls included work excruciating long hours for a few yuan or rmb. ,0

6250,to cool hand luke i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. from the wikipedia deletion guidelinesdeletion process main article wikipediadeletion policydeletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes. . another quick method is the use of proposed deletion simply add to the top of the article. this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the tag within five days and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required.i thought i complied with this policy it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag. it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. beyond meeting the criterias specifics the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia and that the proposal to delete along with the reasons given which i believe are not in good faith therefore violates various wikipedia policies.the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the users prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of as demonstrated by his reasons or comments to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object wikipedia is not a full time job for most users who only visit the site from time to time and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass redirected the article to another article effectively deleting the original article. in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay and when i hit save the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings in bad faith for what i believe were good faith acts on my part and had me blocked before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.it seems quite clear in light of the above and further facts that can be marshalled in support that this users intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy.recognizing this i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform. i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not as the user had made the dispute personal.as for my being blocked by you as per the revert rule i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a users his apparent violations rather than reply he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times in violation of the rule in bad faith turned the rule on mei did not delete anything and technically i did not revert anything either i think but was adding to previous posts and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post.other indications of bad faiththe user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonics rendezvous band by removing the delete tags. my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove,0

6264,hello zwack gb and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions.i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article. your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. to reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. to start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other. if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. here are a few other good links for newcomersthe five pillars of wikipediahow to edit a pagehelp pagestutorialhow to write a great articlemanual of stylei hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date. if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page. again welcome,0

6270, answer to osli those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open onesidedness with serbs and/or milosevic see znet resource for example. when you mention bosniak sources who are you referring to? do you consider the international tribunal a bosniak source? srebrenica massacre is heavily based on internationa tribunals rulling e.g. radislav krstic judgement and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist garbage with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. the bottom line is alternative views do not matter what matters is coldharded facts from such sources as international tribunal human rights watch statesponsored research documentation centre international missing association or whatever the official name is etc. when it comes to editing this article in a rational matter you are the only one who rejects international tribunals version of the article and seeks serbian or proserbian version of the article. as you can see you are not succeeding and your edits dont stay longer than couple of hours. people will not stand for your version of the article because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by international crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources. ,0
6271,yes i do realize a lot of people made contributions to the article when i approached it. this is why i made a lot of effort to get other opinions on the rewrite and what the article should cover. see talksexrewrite of article wikipedia talkwikiproject sexology and sexuality wikipedia talkwikiproject biologysex and wikipedia talkversion. editorial team/core topicssex. no secret has been made of this rewrite—you can see how difficult it has been to get feedback. this article obviously had no steward as you so aptly describe on your userpage. i chose to become that steward when i proposed and made the rewrite. i would eventually like to take this core article to fa and its been difficult to get any feedback.perhaps you didnt realize it but a see also section is deprecated material should be covered within the body of the article. this came up during the genetics fac. im sorry your link got removed i thought i had covered everything in the article. as i noted on the talk page i think the article should have a top level section on evolution and i think this link could eventually go in there.i like you. im surprised hurt and disappointed that youre so quick to be angry with me. in my past experience and up to now with the sex article ive been too hesitant to throw away old material and too slow to rewrite. because i got no response to my proposal and because the article was so poorly written i went ahead and did it. wikipedia encourages us to be bold. who works on gender seemed happy with it. ✉ ✍ ,0

6289,hi math. thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. i find it very interesting. her pictures of womens bodies as commodities are very disturbing while her photos of morrissey are beautiful. i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book but i couldnt order it from amazon apparently they cant ship it to my country.anyway i know what youre talking about information on linder and ludus is very hard to find. besides the ludus biography you quoted ive come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in the guardian article and here is a long and indepth articleher real name is linda mulvey. the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth liverpool and a bit on her background.i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article.besides the importance of being morrissey linder also appeared in southbank show on the smiths. what other magazine articles have you found about her? shes usually mentioned in connection with morrissey and even that is very rarely. the only magazine article i can think of is that infamous nick kent the face article on the smiths. there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance but its similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to plus some interesting quotes by richard boon and trotter. apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle that pete shelley wrote buzzcocks what do i get as a plea of unrequited love for her and that she inspired a lot of devotos early work. her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life besides cemetry gates shes mentioned in entries for miserable lie wonderful woman last night i dreamt that somebody loved me in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single and i wont share you. in the latter theres another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled crepuscule ludus restrospective the end of the note sounds very familiar oh linder. oh linder. ill see you sometime somewhere. however im not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again its not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours morrissey page is one of the examples but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so i dont know. ,0

6307,=the signature of the atomic bombthere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of japan marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per october or dhu alqidah or heshavan . butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. except from this it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. first. art by artists working both before the world war ii during and after can not necessarily be defined as more or less contemporary because of this timestamp. contemporary art did explicitly exist also before world war ii as this label contemporary has been expressed as a mark of quality pertaining especially to modernism by art carrying an ideal summoning from the artist or his genius making some kind of composed expression of what in such case are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world in the event of the artmaking process including its publication or presentation. another trickster is for me that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. it is absurd as a norwegian to not consider henrik ibsen a maker of contemporary art. his plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. i sincerly believe that henrik ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed or may i say be transported by the unfolding of time. the retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the th century. i think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.,0

6362,im sorry you are wrong on both counts. northumbrian is a different dialect to geordie as you have said. the other dialects from the area are makem and pitmatic. northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of northumberland. i being from northumberland myself actually know what i am talking about. if you live in rural northumberland bearing in mind that the shire as northumberland is a shire county is mostly rural you would have a different dialect to someone from newcastle prudhoe or gateshead as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a geordie accent. also no serious linguist would call all these different dialects geordie. i have heard them grouped as northumbrian dialects but not geordie dialects. calling them northumbrian is correct for two reasons one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as northumbria that is northumberland durham newcastle...etc...on the other point you are mistake. england though not the whole uk can be rightly called a germanic nation. it is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say though it is connected in some ways however traditions language laws and history are england was of course founded by...you guessed it germanic tribes whether they are the predominant dna is besides the point. these tribes were the angles saxons jutes and frisians. you cant deny this as before the english kingdoms england did not exist. our language is obviously germanic though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries it is still west germanic. most of our common traditions such as yule yule itself is a germanic word derived from the norse jul are germanic the eating of a christmas ham mistletoe christmas trees yule logs...etcare all germanic. many of our laws come direct from anglosaxon and danish laws though i agree many were modified by the normans who though descended from norwegians are not culturally germanic.as for selfidentity i would say that the english identify themselves with germanic culture albeit in a subliminal way for example the fact that they use anglosaxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. they are identifying with tribes that were danish and northern german and thus germanic so on that score yes the english are a germanic people.and as you bring up dna casually then firstly i will point out that it isnt proven either way whether the anglosaxon dna is more prominent or whether the british used in this sense as preanglosaxon is. different surveys have different results and none have actually been accepted by all experts. and for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the north east of england the germanic percentage is higher than the british thus the predominant dna is germanic the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is anglosaxon or danish viking blood but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is germanic. i dont care whether the modern english have british or anglosaxon blood as i am partly norsegaelic and partly english...thus being a mix. i just do think that the anglosaxon blood is prominent as do many experts in north eastern england.either way germanic blood or british blood...the english are ethnically germanic.note i am not going to lie and say i am not proud of germanic culture as it is obvious especially by my username but i do consider myself british as the uk isnt about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and i am proud of that also. and by the way there is a good case for northumbria being one of the more germanic parts due in a large part to its folklore especially its creatures that include dvergar which they are actually called...they are dwarves and álfar or more correctly ælfe as they are in old english who are known by the common english word elf but are the older and if i may say more correct type. ,0

6369, hu administrator apparent libel and abuse report to a chairhello this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for mount hood done by administrator hu. toward the bottom at the issue stems from as youll see in the articles history section my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for dan howitt with the press article references.hus postafter going through the google results a disturbing education of sorts there appears to be a long line of aliases for dan howitt posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. it has been removed. id suggest that dan howitt read the following wikipediawikipedia is in the real world and law of unintended consequenceshumy replyplease remove hus libel and vandalism above and please report this users abuse to wikipedia administration. also hu of the google results you searched most are in support of dan howitt with tons of his official summit photos on rainier adams hood shasta and listings of his timing officials. you strangely give weight to the abusive chatsite gossip and unsupported libel and your own post above is of that nature. chatsites with this sort of conduct are sad. im reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki talk note hu cites a link above as support for his allegations of dan howitt. in reading the chatsite thread and note its a mere chatsite and has a lot of personal attacks gossip unfounded content libel etc you will nevertheless find considerable support for howitt including climbing record photos timing officials names etc. hu emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases and this is gossip and unsupported.,0

6385, april utcyou are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. in your last revision of the article you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. once again the statement about public schools and id materials was unsourced when you first added it which is why i removed it. upon further examination i removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the centre for intelligent design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. it is actually very unlikely that this centre for intelligent design did so in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in and this organization arose in . finally believing in the historicity of adam and eve does not make one a fundamentalist. many christians reconcile the genesis creation narrative with science see the biologos foundation for example which advocates evolutionary creation. the entire roman catholic church billion people teaches the historicity of adam and eve and that does not make them young earth creationists or fundamentalists. i have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. i hope this helps. thanks talk ,0

6389, ward churchill admits that he is a lying sob dear ward churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of tv cameras last night february that he is not in fact an indian. he has been lying about his heritage for many many years and people like me who live and work in indian country everyday have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage. i repeat ward churchill during his speech at the university of hawaii admitted that he is not an indian. the comment word for word was published in the honolulu starbulletin vol. issue wednesday february churchill attacks essay’s critics by craig gima. im going to attempt to be gracious but i have to say that you and missed the boat on this one. im not going to do it tonight because i do need sleep but there is going to be huge rewrite of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now. these allegations of fabrications have been provable facts of fabrications. it calls into questions so many other things about the guy. what other things is he out and out lying about??? but more importantly the way that the section on his fake indian heritage needs to be completely rewritten. considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in indian country who dared to question his indian heritage claims over the years i think that indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming. so many peoplewho do not even live in indian country who do not work in indian countrymade the claim that to dare question the great ward churchills fake indian heritage was a cheap shot. we have been hearing that from nonindians for many many years and now churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over years. he claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters. that is a damn lie too. he has been claiming indian heritage for over years. it is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books. he refers to the fake indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article. he committed fraud when he applied to the university of colorado. the denver post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is indian for affirmation action purposes. that is a damned lie. there is going to be rewrite and jodi raves comments are going back in and all the rest. your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by churchill himself. feb utc,0

6402,thanks for the reply but i made the suggestion to the editor of the board but he would not listen or even discuss the issue i have stated that the editor has maintained his own personal views into the article. the editor stated i should go and seek this dispute resolution because as far as he is concerned he doesnt want anything that he doesnt agree with on articles linked to sikhism which i deem very one sided and a bit intolerant. thanks i would like this issue sorted i have offered to create an orthodox and unorthodox section on diet in sikhism i have presented the same scholars that where in the original article that the editor cited himself yet when i cited the same scholars to show that they themselves agree that their are passages against meat and many sects against it the current editor of diet in sikhism again took it off. how can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesnt fit in with his own pov which he stated as only being orthodox. i know wiki also has information on shia unorthodox sect of islam does that mean we only adhere to one persons view on sikhism when that person has cited sholars that openly admit that their are passages against meat if that is the case then why cant relevant verses be shown? thanks again i only reponded on here because to be honest im getting lost with all the forms on ,0

6414, is this map accurate? =i see some problems with this map it seems to me that this map only shows the very first homosapiens immigrations not the further ones... a for example regarding new zealand this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that i suppose to be the morioris while we know the maoris the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them were actually polinesian... b europe is shown being occupied by settlers from anatolia those were the certainly the paleoeuropeans... this map does not show the further occupation of europe by the indoeuropeans who originated in the caspian basin migrated to europe and pushed the paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.c the brazilian amerindians are not of colombian ancestry they are either of caribbean origin the caribs and arawaks or of paraguayannorthernargentine origin the tupiguaranis. the bulk of the amerindians who were in brazil about the time of the arrival of the portuguese were these tupiguaranis. they came from paraguay and spread all over the brazilian coast till the valley of the amazon river. when you show a map where brazilian amerindians are all coming from colombia you are showing a totally contradictory information. d the dravidians reached india from ethiopia to yemen from yemen to oman from oman to southeast iran from southeast iran to the valley of indus. what is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of india by the indoeuropeans from iran through bactria.e the hipothesis of ancient waves of paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of north america is ignored while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the mithocondrial gene x xenia among northamerican native americans.f this map also seems to ignore the australoid migrations to south america some people claim that the australoids have reached south america before the mongoloids due to some archeological findings in brazil.anyways i believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homosapiens show on that map are only the first the early migrations and the route of their early settling in india should be corrected. also i would suggest a second map showing further homosapiens migrations now including the maori migration from polinesia the correct migrations in south america and the settling of the indoeuropeans in europe.... r. alberto,0

6418,i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i translate i use province of lower silesia etc. however here on wikipedia i have to go with decisions made long ago. the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. some polish people may not care about it because polish is a readerresponsible language so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. by contrast english is a writerresponsible language i.e. writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable. i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article pages . importantly this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity writing should be clear and concise. plain english works best avoid jargon and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. voivodeship is jargon understandable nearly exclusively to polish people.i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now its too late. i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia. ,0

6441, this is a relatively new website but pardon if im mistaking randi harper is the ceo of oapi correct? this same randi harper has been accused of abuse bullying harassment by another online abuse prevention website stgrb stop the gr bullies harper organized a revolt to write bad reviews of amazon books by authors harper didnt like she contacted amazon directly through her oapi website to get several books from authors she didnt like pulled from amazon. it was first made public by anne rice interview with the vampire author supporter of stgrb through her facebook account and continued updates through her twitter account. harper rallied her twitter followers to publicly attack rice and write articles in gossip websites bluntly lying that anne rice is the harasser. i think it would be best to remove the wiki online abuse prevention initiative entry at least until oapi actually establishes itself because this could be construed as advertisement were promoting harpers repeated hostilities and were certain to see rampant vandalism in response to this wiki. ,0
6442, why will gwen gale not read the sources? on august i posted a section on talk death of adolf hitler titled “random questions” which started “i am not a scholar i read wiki but would not think of editing it. but i was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so i am asking some questions. perhaps someone else will read and address them.” the section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with “as to sources the last books i have read are the murder of adolph hitler by hugh thomas sort of shaky and the last days of hitler by anton joachimsthaler english translation i buy much of this.”gwen gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at she replied with ”as the article lead says...this said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. i say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought up...dodgy. gwen gale talk”by this reply it appears that gwen gale is not familiar with the work of joachimsthaler who i have just referenced and thinks that i am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one. at that time i apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions.at i posted” if i had read kershaws nemesis chapter note and epilogue note i wouldnt have wasted your time. you cant get much clearer than that. should be required reading. perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article. thank you for your time.... talk”at i posted “i would like to direct people to the work of ian kershaw hitler nemesis isbn . chapter and the epilogue relate to this article. please pay attention to his notes and sources. be warned his book hitler a biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....the source joachimsthaler is basically an english translation of a germans analysis of s postsoviet interviews of bunker survivors. the original transcripts must be available somewhere. there are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree. wm talk“since those posts i have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which gwen gale has disputed. much of the material i have posted i have later deleted often because i felt that the endless conflict between gwen gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. anyone who is wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. was i sometimes rude and argumentative? absolutely. was i making legitimate points which related to the article? i thought so. did i receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? i think not but you judge.my main point was that joachimsthaler had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which kershaw backed. i repeatedly begged anyone especially gwen gale to read joachimsthaler and kershaw specifically two footnotes i even told the pages of the footnotes. gwen gale clearly had not read either source. i posted under the heading “question for gwen gale” the following ”i lost you but i’m confused myself. it appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.my very low budget suburb is in a system which serves people with million titles numbers approximate thanks carol. kershaw joachimsthaler thomas trevorroper beevor shirer ryan toland eberle/uhl lehmann/carroll o’donnell victor petrova/watson. vinogradov hit a snag reordered. these are books which i have had in my possession and read parts of since aug . i can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but i think that should be addressed. if someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressed...i know that this is p.o.v. and that i am personally involved. but i can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s talkon gwen gale posted “for starters the russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule. gwen gale talk”. by this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either joachimsthaler or kershaw that gwen gale is still not familiar with either work. joachimsthaler was first referenced by me at august and kershaw was referenced by me at august and i believe that they were both on t,0

6472,== cohanim j eleazar phinchas zadok == agree. dr. karl skorecki have the final word about cohanim genetic signatures. he more than anyone else is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about cohanim genetic signatures not jheald. he was the one who discovered the cmh in . after years he came out to announce in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. katz kaplan rappaport shapiro kovacskonh are all j. those surnames and families are the most prestigious cohanim families today. they are all cohanim j. j cohanim is much more common than j cohanim. skorecki reported that pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j this is a very important information that confirms matematical historic and genealogy facts. phinchas was the son of eleazar. itamar was his brother. out of the cohanim houses did belong to eleazarpinchas while only came out from itamar seed. eleazarpinchas j had a much larger population than itamar. all cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses until the destruction of the second temple. so if phinchas is the origin of all cohanim j than it makes sense since his cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother itamar. so it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two cmhs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of cohanim. all genealogic tree for cohanim since aaron until today are still divided into these two houses eleazarpinchas and itamar. during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim —preceding unsigned comment added by ... whaaaat{during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim}lol +dplease stop being stupid and be realj if for real jews arabisraelites decent ...and j is for goyim jewsfalse jews... agree. dr. karl skorecki of the ramban/technion medical center in haifa who is renowned for his discovery in of the kohen genetic signature reported in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j he suggested. the extended cmh is established for j cohanim only. if somebody in j also has cmh then he is likely to have cohen ancestry. j cohanim form a tight network around cmh. but this is not the case for j. the cmh does not apply to j. if a j is in cmh it tells us nothing about one being a cohen. in j the cmh has no special status. the j lineage of cohanim in cmh could be much more recent. jewish cohanim in j form a much larger network around cmh than jewish cohanim in j do. cohanim jews belong mainly to haplogroup j because cohanim as a group jj have a high frequency of j. the j cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor according to the observed mutation rate which is three times faster than the standard effective rate. j cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly jewish caste jj. “the finding of j among contemporary cohanim can lend credence that today’s cohanim jj may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to phinchas as the founder of j cohanim” concluded dr. karl skorecki.why the confirmation that phinchas may be the orign of j cohanim is so important?“pinchas son of elazar son of aharon the kohen turned back my anger from upon the children of yisrael so i did not destroy the children of yisrael. therefore say behold i give to him my covenant of peace” numbers . “god gave to pinchas a new permanent priesthood for him and his descendants for all generations.” zohar hakadosh a. god indicated that phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counterintuitive form of blessing an allnew form of priesthood. he is given the divine covenant of peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. zadok a des,0

6505,too many generalizationsthere are too many generalizations in here. eg a ref has a quote from one or two people working at an isp was interpreted in the article as the telecommunications industry. or google microsoft and intel support the nbn was interpreted as international technology companies. this it totally misleading. the smaller telcos/isps support anything that reduces telstras power. and global tech companies support anything that will increased demand for their products as long as they dont have to pay for it. ok to mention it of course but generalize and deduct widespread industry support doesnt reflect true complexity of the situation... ,0

6509, replaceable fair use image thanks for uploading image i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. if you believe this image is not replaceable please go to the image description page and edit it to add without deleting the original replaceable fair use template. on the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself.if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on this link. note that fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted days after this notification per our fair use policy. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. ,0

6512,even the claim of essentially segregated lives is bogus. of course lives arent % integrated since these are two different cultures with different customs and languages. but what separation exists is purely voluntary some arabs prefer to live in an arab town/village and thats understandable. most arabs send their kids to arab school so they can study in arabic. however some send their kid to a hebrew speaking school i had an arab classmate for instance whose father was a department head in the city hospital by the way. many arabs live in towns with a jewish majority and theres no law against that and no one prevents them from doing so. several cities in israel have substantially mixed populations including jerusalem haifa jaffa lod ramle beer sheva and others. theres no segregation and no separation. ,0
6513, note the current lead implies israeli aggression against hamas by stating that israel killed several hamas members in khan yunis on july and hamas retaliated with rockets. i have been trying to seek consensus for including the israeli claim that hamas started firing rockets circa june at drn. however it may also be worth noting that israel maintains the hamas members killed in khan yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as israels deadliest attacks in which six palestinian militants died though israel denied any involvement...the israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern gaza area of rafah on the egyptian border where the hamas gunmen died. military spokesman lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into israel. it turns out the same account was given by the new york times when hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives there...hamas blamed israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation. hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an israeli airstrike is not an assertion wikipedia should parrot uncritically. ,0
6514,my reply to the revert issue hello kailash. you asked me the reason for reverting your new upload of and let me tell as it is my duty to inform. firstly you didnt inform me that you are going to upload a new version to the existing poster and you did it. kailash you are a creator of various good articles and uploader of various images in wikipedia with respectable barn stars to your credit and a user with great goodwill and respect among fellow users. should i tell you that your act amounts to vandalism in general ? shall i tell you that even you upload in good faith it will be assumed as vandalism only ? being a honest wikipedian how many times you could have reverted edits showing vandalism ? i didnt specify this because it is a general practice and moreover it would look a bit odd that a user like you indulged in vandalism. so now i think you got your answer. hence i am going to revert back without any reason specified there. still if you revert i will remain silent as i know that you didnt understand me and you are not the same inspiring and honest wikipedian i met during the merging of eega and naan ee. regards,0
6515,the book die nemesis von potsdam has pages of bibliography archives demographic studies official publications of the u.s. great britain france switzerland poland etc. besides secondary literature. these sources are tken into account in some footnotes in the book and brought up to date in the th revised and enlarged edition which you can borrow from any library. as far as german statistics on the deaths that resulted from the evacuation/flight/expulsion of the germans the figure of million deaths is considered to be on the low side of the spectrum. as you may know the german red cross statistisches bundesamt heimatortskarteien gesamterhebung and other professional not amateur institutions carried out careful demographic studies especially in connection with the search for missing persons. this work was carried out over many years and the results were always the same between and million missing and dead. the fact that poland was a victim of aggression and war crimes by both germany and the soviet union does not justify or legalize the crimes committed against east prussian farmers silesian coal miners factory workers and their families. jva,0

6530,regrettably i have to agree about the gameplay section. it comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games using mother as an example than a proper encyclopedic entry. i wont quickfail just for this but i do want it fixed before ill pass. id prefer the section to be rewritten entirely but some glaring points followmother is presented in eight chapters with rotating playercharacters including the protagonists cowboy father the family dog an inept thief and abused monkey so is the protagonist not playable? how large is the party? why are these descriptions in quotes? it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. actually why isnt the protagonist named in this section? again i completely understand the desire to approach this from an outofuniverse perspective but only to the point where the prose doesnt trip over its own detachment.mother begins with naming the members of the playercharacters family along with questions of the players favorite food and thing and opens to a pastoral forest village soon interrupted by a forest fire and the pig mask army who impose police statelike conditions on the village. with the fires outbreak the father ventures out to protect his family twin sons lucas and claus and wife hinawa but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. they set out to take down the pig mask army. lucas the games hero does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. the game features a lighthearted plot with enemies like partying ghosts and talking rope snakes. porky a character from earthbound appears as the leader of the pig mask army and is the games main antagonist. in addition other earthbound characters such as dr. andonuts and mr. saturn also appear. why isnt this stuff in plot? the cast of characters does need to be introduced better but jamming plot details into gameplay isnt the way to do that.the second paragraph is better its more in line with what i expect from a ga gameplay section. at least its good until apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor. whats the predecessors battle system like? remember not everyone reading this has played earthbound.there is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles first of all this should start off with a however or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. the information is also lacking though why isnt there a need to grind for experience? i think of this as one of the central loveitorhateit jrpg mechanics and im curious as to how the genre might work without it. imagine reading a pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed which is unusual for a jrpg without giving a brief overview of how the pc and day care systems work thats how i feel reading this. and lets the player see their magic psi power abilities viewing your abilities probably isnt a necessary gameplay detail but why isnt there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? and do they have uses outside battle like hms rock smash secret power and softboiled do in pokémon?while mother s music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new it features similar sound effects. by completely new do you mean it isnt recycled wholesale or that the style is somehow new? also this bit probably doesnt belong in gameplay.if youre up to rewriting this which i encourage especially if youre shooting for fa id recommend a structure like the followingparagraph its a topdown jrpg theres an overworld you explore towns with your team of characters yada yada yada.paragraph there are battles theyre not random with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles is it like in pokémon colosseum where you only fight other trainers or like in dragon ball z buus fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them? this is how the battle system works this is how items work this is how experience points/leveling work again how is this the case without grinding? or is a different system used entirely?.paragraph your team consists of suchandsuch a number of characters they change with different events in the story characters do/dont return once they leave here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.stuff like items and saving can you save anywhere? work in wherever you want im not picky. september utc,0

6571,okay i disagree with this just as strongly as i disagree with attempts to say he wasnt jewish. firstly marx didnt kill anybody nor did his ideology. a bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people. and given that the german people managed to produce some unquestionably german people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people im not going to weep for the fact that the germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century. beyond that marx was born and grew up in germany with a very limited connection to his jewish ancestry. his primary language was german and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works. although he spent most of his later life in england ive never really heard that he didnt always consider himself to be a german id think in fact that living in england would have accentuated that. while i do think that his jewish background is important and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a jew his german background was substantially more important than his jewish one. his own works emerged out of posthegelian debates within the german philosophical community and his greatest influence throughout his life and for several decades afterwards was in germany where marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of europe britain france and russia in particular had their own nonmarxist socialist traditions that were not assimilated into marxism for a long time if ever. marx was german of jewish descent. being an internationalist is a statement of intentions for the future of the world not of present day identity. ,0

6580,i am sorry that i dislike persistent stalkers...and i do hope that you apply controls on nocal for his past stalking and also keep a check on his future behaviour...i do realise i was intemperate in the comments...i just dont like stalkers...i have had run ins with other editors of different political persuasions. to cut down on the conflict i go around articles that are way off the beaten track unreferenced and badly written. so i am at a loss of what more i can do to keep my head down when there is a wiki stalker around... ,0
6581,hey wow...thats pretty evil. but can you throw the yuppieskins into the washing machine?,0
6582,hey im trying to work with you guys. slander and defamation of sources you disagree with doesnt work. if you have counterevidence present it. if not im going to fix the page myself as ive made a good faith best effort to work with those who have had complaints.,0
6583,more than two days in which you were able to make a number of other edits is suddenly? given that he mentioned checking your contributions emphasis on the plural i would venture that the subsequent edits have much more to do with it than the comment above. ,0
6584,dont give fake warning to users. you may not bite the noobies. thank you.,0
6585, nrsv the section included the sentence the nrsv translation for includes this translation note other ancient authorities read six hundred and sixteen.theres no reason to privilege the nrsv here over other translations that carry notes to the same effect particularly since the paragraph is describing exactly those other ancient authorities referenced in the note. mention of it is therefore redundant it adds no new information.this sentence is also a wordforword rehash of a reference in the lede about the variant i am cutting that as well since more specific secondary sources are already cited. ... ,0
6586,got it. i do appreciate that there those such as yourself guarding wikis integrity.,0
6587,good point but i cant help to notice the editing history of this article and how it reflects continued polarization against and for it. im not going to implement the same edits again in the reception and criticism section if they are once again reversed. i still support the truism that most rpgplayers with an opinion on this game either love it or hate it and that the game technically is a sequel within the final fantasy universe. x is simply a direct sequel. but like i said if you guys do not want that edit to stay in the r and c section i will not include it again in the same context since it seems so far that several people disagree with that last sentence.,0
6588,i mean really they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith adding information that was included in an already used source. their edit summary didnt show any hostility so you should not retaliate with any. odds are they havent even looked at their talk page so your comment wont be read anyways. if the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out maybe this is a problem you should see about solving instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you. plus antoshi already warned them on their talkpage and they have not added anything since showing that maybe they have listened to the advice. your threat was completely unnecessary. maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added but rejected and why would be a better option. wpagf and wpbite are very important. like i said in the dispute resolution page i dont mean to make any enemies. i think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects. although your attitude when people do things against your wishes needs to be worked on if you wish to avoid further complications. talk·edits ,0

6592,they are technically possible to view ingame. if what ive read is right remote monitor views are done using engine camera entities meaning that the combine advisor model is somewhere on the maps which it appears on a monitor moving about. of course this would probably mean using noclip and searching.,0
6593,take your time. if and when you go over the history of yost again i will be curious about any mention of scheme especially if such also mentioned mcgugin. if it gives accounts of either one punting that too adds a certain color to their story. given their emphasis on it one has to get a kick punt not intended out of yost teaching his boys to punt or mcgugin booming punts in an allstar game in his th year at vandy. would you happen to know if yost ran the same schemes at his various jobs before michigan? i would assume so and have a few other tenuous reasons to think so.,0
6594,and oh no look who showed up. is it the millions of other editors or hundreds of other admins for wikipedia ready to discuss the atrocity occurring here? no. just the usual suspects. methinks they doth protest too much. ohnoitsjamie says i was warned numerous times about personal attacks but the only ‘evidence’ he links has no warning by him for personal attacks. he says i attacked the person kind enough to mentor me but his link shows no comment by me. he says that ‘if i didnt block you someone else would have.’ stand back everyone. the omniscient ohnoitsjamie is going to predict the future actions of all other admins. case and point. ohnoitsjamie is not interested in the appearance of an impartial decision. he would rather save us all the time that justice takes and act as accuser jury and executioner.,0

6609, i understand quite well the situation in albanian because it occurs also in my native romanian and other balkan languages e.g. in romanian great man is usually omul mare or un om mare but it also can be marele om. it is related to compound names and nouns and actually you brought it up when you started lecturing on albanian structures in a postscriptum. all your examples come from modern albanian not from protoalbanian whatever language it was. i can add some etymologies such as the one orel provided for thënukël = dogberry from earlier thënubël < palb. tsunuabōla cf. lith. šúnobuolas dacian kinouboila = dogs apple. in what you quoted so far hamp did not claim anything about protoalbanian compound nouns or syntax. please provide relevant bibliography otherwise i dont see why should we be dismissive of other scholars theories. orel georgiev and many others are also linguists. ,0

6616,look a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing but since you two have now discussed the rough equivalent of pages this discussion is obviously stalled. let me try to sum up what i think about this topicplease be aware that wpatt like any other wp policy isn’t written in stone and saltyboatrs extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say.every article published in foreign affairs is reviewed by other scientists which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. that should be enough to make sure wpatt isn’t a good reason to ban them.i have to agree with ultramarine if you use your interpretation of wpatt consequently there’s only a handful of wparticles that would survive the necessary massdeletion of references. what’s more i think it would be some pretty bad ones those that rely entirely on newspaper articlesfinally there really is no good reason why articles that i could use in every political science paper and any scientific article shouldn’t be enough for wikipedia. ,0

6637,kurdistan?kurdistan is not a geopolitical region. theres a region called kurdistan in iraq. theres a region called kurdistan in iran. theres no region called kurdistan in turkey. thats akin to placing an algeristan in france and making an article that treats it like a country. there are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. kurds are a minority in turkey just like the hispanics in usa or algerians in france. as ludicrous as it would seem to place a mexicistan or algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in it is to list a kurdistan that includes turkish territory. as long as we dont declare san diego mexicistan which mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a rippedup treaty claiming it it is equally ridiculous to list kurdistan in turkey. in iraq a country that was set up by the british merging territories a region called kurdistan warrants an article as the kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. but i call bs on turkey being listed under kurdistan as turkey does not have a region named kurdistan and kurds are turkish citizens not living under a kurdish state like in iraq whom prints their own passports and such. ,0

6639,where do you see dennis saying step it up? the only thing close to that is his comment here to bump it up which is clearly referring to drn the wikipediadispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall wikipedia dispute resolution process and it is very clear that userbecritical understands that dennis is talking about the wpdr process because becritical actually refers to arbitration followed by dennis mentioning wprfc/u and wikipediaarbitration. stepping it up and/or bumping it up has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you. nor do any of the other comments by dennis even suggest such a thing be done or has been done. secondly you were indeed at the brightline threshold of wprr with three clear reverts in hours had you reverted again within the next minutes yes its just that strict of a line you could have been blocked without further warning since you been warned about rr several times in the past it was very generous of dennis to warn you. you were edit warring against multiple other editors. and just a reminder that you dont have to cross the brightline threshold of wprr to be blocked for edit warrring so be more cautions and find consensus on the talk page instead.dennis is a fine admin and has been nothing but helpful and nice to you i think you should return the favor show him some good faith and stop the accusations of wrongdoing on his part. ☥ ,0

6644,thanks. i nearly drowned when i was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath but somehow i managed to swim back on board s.s titanic. ironic really given what i see coming up ahead. perhaps i should have saved myself the trouble and just stayed in the icy water.your comments are interesting and may well be correct however they dont really address the point i was making regarding the gross almost embarrassingly obvious errors in the academic geek created/mindless computer driven financial models currently used around the world. the most similar theory to the one ive pustulated above comes out of this piece from the prophet robert k. landis where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis. ludwig von mises obviously had similar ideas but no one has really done the hard financial modelling on this austrian school theory and tried to collect longterm historical data tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels the frequency and severity of socalled black swan events in financial markets. my hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels you will see bifurcating bell curve returns i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness.landis comes close but still no cuban cigar. anyway his piece is very topical right now and made for interesting bedtime reading tucked away here as i am in my tiny little third class cabin far far away from the mad money crowd. ,0

6759,improving the twin paradox article hi. any edits i have made to the article have been immidiately reverted. i do not wish to impose my own views on the article. however in its current form it does not in any way reflect the complexity or interest inherent in the problem. as an example of a recent paper which relates to your question so may interest you please see moving observers in an isotropic universe. the paper itself can be downloaded pdf version. this paper differs from my own view but illustrates the inherent and enduring interest of the problem. my major objection to the wikipedia article in its current form is it solves the paradox by mistating it. i.e. by stating a nonparadox in place of the interesting ones. how can i go about getting the article expanded to reflect the varying points of view? i dont want to get involved in a reverting war. any advice you can give me would be much appreciated,0

6780,i repeat the text was about a minority school these schools were the same for every minority not about the treatment of germans in the public. secondly the weak identity thing is a nice lie because then you have to explain why the slovaks did not have weak identity in romania or in serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in hungary although the opposite was the case after the population exchange i will answer you because their schools were shut down in the s. thirdly you somehow forget that whether the minorities not only slovak have a weak identity or not the hungarian government unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction you can play with words but that is a fact bilingual schools even if they would work which they did not are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the magyarisation and this aim was successfully achieved. or are you implying that since the minorities had such weak identity the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language?? do you actually read what you write? ,0

6788, about your comment on elaragirls talk page hello dev i couldnt help but notice your comments on talk page under the heading esperanza so im sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy or elaragirls. i wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with esperanza and some editors how shall i say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others. as for the governance issue i personally dont understand the current structure and i dont feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.i still think that an offwikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on esperanzas page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on wikipedia. whats one more click of the mouse? just so you know i had participated a little in the coffee lounge but i got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which i felt were sexist offensive and not at all belonging on wikipedia. because i had participated only to a limited extent my overall edit count as of wasnt seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.i had proposed a hypothetical merger between esperanza the kindness campaign and concordia and while i still think that many of their stated goals overlap i also feel that esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. i was unaware that esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. if you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant chalk it up to my own shortsightedness not to esperanza as a whole.i know that we may differ in our views of what to do with esperanza but at least the mfd and in particular comments by you elaragirl and others have given the impetus for esperanza to examine itself. thank you for that.since ive typed this much i might as well invite you to review me at editor review. thanks again for your participation in all of this. ,0

6794,from my standpoint you are the confused. im looking at it in the rd person. what the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. fact is that the britons were in an antiangles coalition and the angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. if the britons had contact to the former roman empire is unclear but possible. they lived under roman rule for centuries and were romanized. this defeat was something like deromanizing to them after years of roman rule. this can clearly be seen when you read and understand the roman britainanglosaxon battles in germanic wars.,0

6800,yep that all makes perfect sense and the move is uncontroversial with me and the pages creator with whom i discussed this a bit on the talk page when i made my initial illfated moves. just to clarify what i was after with singular v. plural so as not to appear a plodding dolt i meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre. a point of general interest the other singular pinakes listed in the suda entry arent considered parts of the work known as the pinakes that being πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν. i dont know that i believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments but who am i? going this route id actually be alright with no mention of the/any pinakes appearing on the pinax page this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at athens. thanks for looking at this and i hope that i can get back to that article soonish and will be thinking about the extracallimachean angle that need to be pursued—please let me know if any other names come to mind.,0

6818,for what its worth i suggest you refrain from pushing the socks remarks around as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. given that an spi has been opened and checkuser denied due to stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone it serves no purpose to accuse him further just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. no one is going to win that type of argument. also i suggest you stop calling cowboy jake from now on as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. clearly he is determined to push his case and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. but if you give them enough rope theyll eventually hang themselves with it. challenging suspected socks nonstop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. spi does not support the claim at present and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf whatever the outcome. im sure by rotating ip he probably means proxies. it isnt important though. cheers  chat • rff ,0

6823,==another specific example====under genetic explanations wrn has written this to support these claims they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in iq . black–white–east asian differences in iq reaction time and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. in the united states significant blackwhite iq differences are observable at every age above years within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested in every region of the country and at every time since the invention of ability tests. . jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different iq subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability. from these and other findings they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis. . the rising heritability of iq with age within all races studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at % in infants rises to % in middle childhood and peaks at % in adulthood and studies showing the virtual disappearance . by adulthood of shared environmental effects on iq for example family income education and home environment with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in iq than with strangers from these studies they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for iq difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on iq to fully account for group differences.. studies of us comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races for blacks and for whites across the entire range of iqs despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examinedthis seems to be excessive detail. wrn has essentially recreated rushton/jensen arguments and placed citations in his citation. this essentially allows wrn to write an entire section as if it were incontrovertible based on various references without any possible response. the npov fact that should be reported is that rushton and jensen make some assertions not that they make some assertions and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up. if anything every one of their lines of evidence should be attributed directly to rushton and jensen as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the genetic hypothesis depending on the viewer. it seems very weaselly in any case. can we agree these four points should be removed from the article? comments? ==,0

6836,balance==i find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory. to introduce badoglios career by saying he was an italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing red cross hospitals and ambulances during the ethiopia campaign. due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely. thats words about his military and political career and about his activities as a war criminal. the war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence. if this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of badoglios involvement in the events. it seems to me far more important to stress the facts that badoglio was one of italys most senior military figures during the second world war despite his doubts about italys strategic capabilities and that he became prime minister after the downfall of mussolini. badoglios role in the inexplicable two months delay between july and september when italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while germany rushed troops south to fortify the italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career. whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively badoglios inaction condemned italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war. this article in its present form barely mentions those events. ==,0

6843,article evaluation article evaluation for this assignment i was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about change management. the first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic however it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. they key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. the information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. it most definitely covers a variety of topics including the reasons for such change. in addition to that the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. there is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. the article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text which can be found in the reference section. the contribution considers a variety of perspectives however i think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. it takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. i think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. the article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. it does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. in terms of article length the only thing i would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. overall it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. i couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. in terms of structure i would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.,0

6857,=wolfram===a hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it. such bodies do not reflect light and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be selfluminous. all blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium. however the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength known as the planck law cannot be predicted using classical physics. this fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics. wolfram referenced to eisberg r. and resnick r. thermal radiation. § in quantum physics of atoms molecules solids nuclei and particles nd ed. new york wiley pp. .i think this also supports the must emit part of the definition. ==,0

6872,the table of sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the three sacks in order to raise the yamiking and likewise hydrate to the surface. typically a being from the reverse maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions we see when crimson love and the sacks return to the dark world they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface. my assumption is that an object such as the yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use. thus the table of sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals in the form of a clock to power the yamiking. after the sacks summon the clock crimson and love throw over defeated opponents already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff into each number with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the yamiking. ,0

6923,xenodontlikeit typically when xenophrenic sees a valid edit by wiki policy that he disapproves of for whatever reason he seeks to get others to remove it. this strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance or needs the proper context or isnt the full story etc. there are many different reasons used but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense > to ratio in his pov that average editors cringe when they see it. xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced pov version can only stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. this leads to edit warring over days and even weeks articles often get locked down. some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. some call this tactic a form of wikiterrorism i say it shows that xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent not a terrorist even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.,0
6924, the burke group in response i never provided where he went to school. i added he is a j.d. rather than delete he is a j.d. juris doctor then refer to him as dr. david burke? a j.d. is a doctor of jurisprudence same as a ph.d. why do you allow personal information thats good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more? he was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying he owns a rental property in agoura hills with a meaningless political contribution? the property posted is a rental where he no longer lives and maybe never did. how is that useful in an article about organized labour? you said it yourself the article should be about the company. but in actual fact he is the company. hes a flight instructor whom i know from our fbo flight base operation. lots of people know him. he hasnt contributed to republicans for years. look at the site you provided last one was . why continue to keep outdated useless information? the article cited by dr. john logan a very learned fellow contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. even he can make mistakes. i am a lawyer and logan is a british economist and may understand e.u. law but does not understand u.s. labor law. just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it. there is no newspaper article about cdn that says employees were awarded from the court of appeals. he wrote incorrectly. the citation provided which corrects his article is from the court dockets. which is a better citation? i provided the citation from the law firm that won the civil case against cdn i removed nothing about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between nlrb law and dol law and civil actions filed with the district courts. what john logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the f.a.a. but tried at the d.m.v. are you british? f.a.a. is federal aviation admin. and d.m.v. is dept. of motor vehicles. they are not related anymore than nlrb is to district court or civil cases.. burke works in nlrb jurisdiction and the case you cite is a civil action in district courts not related. if you want cdn discussed first part is fine but the civil action is not. there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for cdn. logans article used as a citation lacks any credible legal citation connecting burke to the civil case. only a legal citation should be used. there are none available. djb is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. no matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed. if you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right. am i being picky? yes. inside the law you cant just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks. deleting facts for fiction is beneath the dignity of what wikipedia has strived to promote. why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions? how is that possible when wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more? you think the sum total for the reader should be that burke owns a rental property in agoura hills? how is that related to the burke group? please stop the generalities and provide facts i contributed and tell me exactly how the citation or tone can be improved and let me do that. also please define what is meant by tone. by the way...are you a wikipedia staff editor or administrator? thank you. arabianrider ,0

6936,sitush no need to pretend as if you really apologise i know about your attitude behaviour joshua jonathan i am telling this to youas there is no need for you to pretend that you have examined the sourcesi have seen your examination which is totally unjustifiable and not valid and also i dont have faith in you because even you includes the group of users to support sitush who make conspiracies in editing articles.i know how you edit articles also how you support sitush.and also another thing i have to saythat there is no proof needed and also no need of wikipedias acceptance that sun rises in east.in the similar waythat rajus or rajulu is not a caste nametheir caste name is kshatriya which is mentioned by government of india. it is as foolish as sun rises in west like way that a christian european like you a group of shudras when centuries back doesnt have the ability to touch the boots of kshatriyas when they lived in palaces kingdomsnow people like you your pack are judging the kshatriyas to be kshatriyas or not.i know you always support unreliable books written in favour of low class dalitsconverted christians bahujansshudras beacause of your anti upper caste hindu will laugh at you and your mate the users like sitush his pack of dogs will definitely pay for the conspiracy when the time comes and also because truth is even supported and protected by god.finallyremember what should be done to this rajus article will definitely be you ,0

6944, march utcthat sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. the rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. you may think that this is obvious but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the ut report were influenced by the funding received.perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? i mean thats about the only way you could ever meet your demand. what an utterly absurd request. its easy to see why it was made though just set the bar so high it cant be jumped then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you dont like. maybe youd have me hack the email accounts of the authors fish around for evidence assuming there is even any there then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that i can cite on here. only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by texas. the universitys state is the heart and soul of us oil gas but thats certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true the university has multimilliondollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the united states not to mention other oil gas companies with interests in fracking. i have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links but only a fool would suggest the potential isnt there. if you dont like the juxtaposition just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak pathetic and denigrating as you like for all i care maybe something like socialist—nay communist—campaigners in the pay of a european maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest noting that... for comparison take the recent globalwarming sceptics at the heartland institute as soon as details of the institutes funding were leaked they were prominently reported in the press. we dont even need leaks here the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out as smm` and others have done. all you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. according to ian urbina we cant even get a decent untarnished report out of the epa unlike texas the epa doesnt even take industry funding for gods sake yet still it cant escape heavy industry pressure to redact. aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes i have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to though i am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry and their paidfor puppets in government to tone down or eliminate negative findings and the truly just ridiculous claims about frackings potential by people like lord browne here in england. and i couldnt care less if frackings safe or not. why should i? or anyone? if its not its not if it is... it is outside of a lunatic asylum who would care? if it is safe enough bring it on jobs tax receipts increased energy security reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldnt be interested in those things particularly given the current economic situation. what i dont like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material. ,0
6945,sure theyre subjective theyre rhetorical i was arguing a case. i still think that the single arrival point article to which all others direct should be the most neutral. i believe that that when dealing with periods in the past should be assumed to be the title used in the subjects own time necessarily adjusted for the english language in an e lang encyclopedia here philip the tetrarch. the herod philips have to be there because people will search for them. these pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time and then send the seeker to the historical name. if someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that theologians use ... and historians use ... that would be a welcome addition. this means that all the terms would be in wikipedia they would all be findable and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information and i trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. i dont want to move any pages just tidy up the way of finding them. i dont think this is as strong an advice as you do more of a signpost perhaps a better image than guide? in particular i was astonished when i began this by the confusion over hp i hp ii. evidence for the elder philip seems minimal.,0

6970,well i used to work up at the mall for a storewhich has since closed and i know all the inside dirt as to why nobody wants to bring any new business industry or stores here. i cant get into the specific detailsthats an entirely different topic but i can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now. cambridge shopping centers has placed it up for sale time and time again. nobody wants it and i dont blame them. if sears ever decides to pull out of there they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it because the land is worth more than the mall itself. everything is going northside anyway. downtown chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the s and it never fully recovered. and the capitol theatre? give me a break. they might as well give up on that too. its been what? over ten years now and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing we stil arent any closer to it being finished or having a final completion date. as far as chatham as a city goes i have never seen so many unsavoury shady people in my life. not everyone is like that i agree but yes it would seem as though chatham does qualify as the welfare capitol on ontario. drugs unwed mothers crackheads dropouts second and third generation welfare families a plethora of health problems and well you get the pitcure. is it any wonder why the younger crowd is leaving in droves? i cant say that i blame them. the grass is greener on the other side. chathams prime was over a long time ago. its london and points east that you want to be...,0
6971,im only answering this because im really bored excruciatingly so and i also find it kind of amusing. people writing and or approving of psychologically harmful disinformation that starving girls read including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl illicits no response whatsoever. a collapsible box however seems to be somehow construed as a threat to civilization. one inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. despite only having a ninth grade education i actually did learn how to read. i also learned the proper use of latin phrases e.g. id est i.e and exempli gratia e.g.. for example or to use an abbreviation of a latin phrase e.g. ...in article text i.e. how they were recently used here. should have been e.g. not i.e.. that being said i read this moscollapsescrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use but should not be used in article prose. this includes reference lists image galleries and image captions collapsible sections are useful in infoboxes or to consolidate information already covered in prose.this is not prosecandidate genes include dopamine transporter dopamine receptors d/d dopamine betahydroxylase monoamine oxidase a catecholaminemethyl transferase serotonin transporter promoter slca hydroxytryptamine a receptor hta hydroxytryptamine b receptor htb the repeat allele of the dat gene the repeat allele of the drd gene and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene dbh taqi.your alleged concern over compliance with wpaccess is unwarranted and seems to be self serving. it says nothing about collapsible boxes. as i stated in an aforementioned paragraph anorectic kids reading about death mortality and suicide after enjoying a triggering look at an inappropriate image should be a cause for concern not collapsible boxes.youre a college graduate with according to you this users intelligence quotient is annoyingly high please conduct yourself accordingly chose your arguments wisely and learn the difference between e.g. and i.e. also thank you for giving me something to do by writing a response i was sooooo bored. cura ut valeas ,0

7006,well i am not goint to stay it simply to much of a waste of time maybe i will check back in in a few years and i would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me. it would not be hard to find my real email address using the information about me you already know. but i will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation. the tangut did not speak chinese they spoke their own language. the official name of their land in their own language has been written about by ksenia kepping and is available on a link from the tangut language page. in no case was xia there autonym. it was something like minyag which is waht they are called in tibetan. in general i have a big chip on my sholder about sinologists becomming confucian literati. the yuan and qing were no more chinese than i am. to use chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval chinese worldview. while now it is indeed true that the prc owns a big chunk of asia how much of it is actually historically china?the jurchens kitans tangut mongols tibetans nanchao azha tüyühün were their own countries with their own languages and customs. tangut history is relevant to chinese history in the way that french history is relevant to english history but also vice versa. to have a thing on the article saying this article is part of the section chinese history reinforces the view that the tanguts dont deserve their own history. there is a sociological fact about western academia that sinology is big and well funded while tangutology nanchaology kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. but this is a fact about us and not about the history of central/east asia.,0

7043,im not talking about belief of majority. in fact i would presume a billion muslims specifically state he did not claim to be god and many of other faiths would agree. im saying i dont think we have any facts to solidly state by encyclopedia standards whether jesus claimed to be a god or not. you can object because its unclear but your statement he did not claim he was god is merely your opinion. you really cant prove it. considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god i think may make it relevant here but i could see taking it off as disputed. although if you want to get into it in many books ive read indicate hong xiuquan did not claim to be god either. he believed that jesus was the son of god but not god. he had an arian view of jesus and of his own role as son of god. although i added her it sounds possible that this mita woman only believed she contained the holy spirit rather then was the holy spirit. yet you dont object on those or ones that may even be more debatable. in least in the case of jesus the idea he claimed to be god is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him. ,0

7072, vienna dude seriously. wprs and wpv dont get thrown out the window just because mary jo foley of microsoft provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a socalled spokesman about the change in name. nobody at microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say yes the name is vienna in the last few days. doesnt that strike you as somewhat odd? we can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team or a page on microsofts web site. not this time. im not going to bother with renaming back to windows blackcomb since youll probably change it back to vienna without bothering with that nagging wikipedia requirement of verifiability. this isnt a race. okay... whats the point of these constant reverts back to blackcomb? im really sure now that the codename is vienna. the change was recent lets not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. no offense but you seem to like the name blackcomb much better than vienna. get over it. it was changed. now it wasnt only scoble who confirmed it. my guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. several sources claim its vienna so lets keep it that way. there were rumours about longhorn being changed to vista but later it was confirmed. lets just leave the article alone for right now. — ,0

7104,requests for commentive echoed the suggestions of mackensen and others that you take this to wikipediarequests for comment. your most recent reply on mackensens talk page is i could but i think arbcom should accept the case with or without an rfc. theres too much misconduct to willfully ignore. besides youre only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable why would i ever take that advice?there are several problems with this response firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through rfc the closer or the first articles for deletion discussion who as far as i can tell played no part in earlier discussions who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions and an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said if you cant be bothered with an rfc then we cant be bothered with an arbitration case. has also remarked on your failure to follow process here. again you allege misconduct on a scale too great to wilfully ignore. if there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators cant see it it looks like youll have to make it more apparent to them.but finally despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to rfc you say that i in particular am only asking you to go to rfc to delay the inevitable. well im not sure that you and i can agree on what the inevitable is in this case. to my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldnt like to hear what the arbitrators have to say and theyve hinted on this in their comments on the case. but since theyre obviously not going to accept the case until youve at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution im urging you to do so. if an arbitration case follows the sooner the better as far as im concerned so get cracking. tony sidaway ,0

7111,dear michael thanks for your comment. i made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly years ago see the version at that time . it said einstein–cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity to handle spin angular momentum correctly. at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity without extensions describes the spin incorrectly. as far as i can read this is no longer claimed by the article. einsteincartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity with some extra fields torsion but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields dont exist and theyre not needed. if you care about sociology no research of cosmology or calculations of nasas experiments or anything of the sort takes the torsion field into account because the latter doesnt exist as far as the existing evidence theoretical or experimental can say. today its not an important proposal to extend gr. the new article doesnt make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity without torsion is inconsistent with the spin or something like that so i wouldnt protest against the new version. visually it surely looks like a wellwritten article. however i see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesnt explain the basic points too clearly. einsteincartan theory is not just about the tetrads. tetrads are indeed useful and in some formal sense necessary to describe spin in general relativity. however using the tetrads formalism is not yet einsteincartan theory. einsteincartan theory assumes that torsion may be nonzero even though it is identically zero in general relativity which normally uses the metric. one can write gr in terms of tetrads as well and the torsion is still zero. if thats so one isnt doing einsteincartan theory. ,0

7131,mentioning darwin gave up natural selection and became a lamarckianthe article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of the origin of species which went into different editions by . hence i propose the following insert at the first darwin quotation in the current section ‘publication of the theory of natural selection’ which i also propose should be retitled ‘publication of the darwin’s theory of evolution’.proposed inserthowever even in the first edition of his book darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection but not the only one. in the last sentence of its introduction he said “furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”but by he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution with its strong principle of inheritance in favour of lamarckian environmentalism with a changing environment as the main selector. as c.d. darlington wrote in in his foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of the originlet no one imagine however that in the world of science darwins theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. on the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....the most abiding source of trouble was that discovered by the professor of engineering at edinburgh. professor flemingsic jenkin pointed out in that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type and its differences as darwin believed blended in inheritance. nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. darwins defence against this objection was already prepared. he had hinted it in the first edition of the origin of species at the end of the introduction he had said that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification. in later editions he hedged further. he fell back on the other means. these depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. in adopting this view darwin was giving up his own and wallaces peculiar claim to originality he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of lamarck. p. xvii on the origin of species by means of natural selection first edition reprint in the thinkers library by watts co . but darlington failed to establish lamarcks theory was discarded or disreputable. in fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the midth century with the ‘mendeliandarwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. but even by darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to darlingtonin view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that darwinism in all civilised countries would be taught as one of the foundations of thought that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. that is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. but where as in its applications to ourselves in the study of the genetics of men and to the histories of nations as exact knowledge of the principles of variation hybridization and selection is required we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. at the same time the foundation of darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in darwins own country. the universities with their museums and botanic gardens are happy to forget what in they were unable to resist. they contain no memorial of his work and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. the old pedantic learning of botany and zoology which darwin treated as one subject they continue to cleave asunder burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction. ‘’ibid’’ pxviiixix. i also propose the following edit of the articles introductionhis book ‘’on the origin of species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species but by its sixth edition darwin had abandon,0

7137, spventi but perhaps its safest to discuss your concerns before making arbitrary changes. indeedly. sorry for my thoughtlessness.i have no intention to suggest a change from nakashite to nakasete but would feel better if miseyo is changed to miseu or miseyou because みせよ cannot be an expression of version in spventi referred is modernized in wording and both of the two sources say it was written by 松浦靜山 i would say みせう is the original. plus the explanation 「松浦靜山の『甲子夜話』にみえる川柳。おそらくはよみ人知らず」 sounds much more reliable than 「江戸後期の平戸藩主・松浦静山が詠んだ句」. then みせよう should be a more adequate modern japanese word here than みよう. i suspect that it might be a typo or mistranslation. now here is a third source a text book for juniorhigh isbn in which the one for hideyoshi is written as 鳴かぬなら鳴かしてみせようほととぎす. spventi then the onus is on you to provide information that suggests otherwise. indeedly. but i cant find an english word to express hototogisu. that is why i questioned. it is a family of cuckoo but smaller. and it really sings. a popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come while hototogisu being the one for the summer. here is an illustration. i was not suggesting to change the word but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. if not it can stay as it your concern about the word coax is entirely misplaced. and jimlockhart i think coax is fine for saying that hmmm. i withdraw. i trust you two than my dictionaries. one comment to jimlockhart. yes he used flattery when necessary especially in his early times and i dont think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. that was not my worry. what i wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. you wrote resourseful as he was that i accepted the word coax and the form without first person i admit spventis saying the changes you made to the english versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements. sorry again. one last question dont you feel like making some mutial reference between this section and toyotomihideyoshiculturalpointofinterest? ,0

7139,but the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. for instance youve assumed i wanted roux gone when theres never been any such expressed desire from me either im or explicitly neither before nor now. it also seems that youve excused roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for not to say i feel i should be excused from anything ive done.if i may express my opinion roux is a good editor but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique yes i bare my own biases but i come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences and recent events seem to show that it isnt changing. it is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim and seemingly sensing some threat responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. while that can cause some problem in itself the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who dont buy his claims of innocence and casualty after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. if it wasnt already obvious i am one of those stubborn persons believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. thus i honestly dont for one minute buy that roux was driven to do anything he chose to participate here in the manners that he did both good and bad and he chose to leave just as i chose to participate in the manners that i did chose to leave chose to come back chose to leave again chose to come back and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things. i like the idea of roux no longer being an obstacle but do not feel comfortable about the way in which it came to be im not sure that anybodys actually won in this case. ,0

7154, incorrect speedy deletion you were incorrect to speedy delete categoryscience and technology in myanmar. firstly this is a first level national subcategory that it standard issue for every country in the world above the level of a microstate and such categories should never be deleted. it should have been fixed instead. secondly it is was empty i suspect you have played into the hands of someone who takes a nonneutral stance on the burma/myanmar naming issue and has abused process by emptying the category without following due process on wikipediacategories for discussion. i will be correcting your error later today when i have time. actually the discussion at the cfd you mentioned does seem to have clear concensus no opposes in fact and this was just one of several myanmar>burma categories that i deleted. another user has removed all the articles from these categories and i suppose placed them into new categories as described in the cfd. your message does not have the tone of a good faith communication which attempts to work together to improve this encyclopedia but rather a chastisement after your mind is made up on the issue. please be more mindful of your tone in messages to other users. as for im gonna fix... please ensure that your actions are per concensus and not just how you want it. talk contribs ,0

7260,hi again. i do have this in the back of my mind and am aware of it. apologies for being slow getting back to you.its a really hot day here in the uk after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. im not sure what youre asking me. i think youre talking about categorybeverage companies and how breweries end up there. at some point that has been organised thus categorybeverage companies categoryalcoholic beverage companies categorybeer and breweries by region categorybeer and breweries in north america categorybeer and breweries in the united states categorybeer and breweries in alabama. the brewing companies are contained within each beer and breweries in foo cat. what you are proposing is the same thing as already exists but separating the companies from the brands at a low level and then having two cats one of products and one of companies running side by side up the tree. what i am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. wed like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multipurpose cat. beer and brewery are often related. bass and heneiken for example refer both to product and company. where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article. would you ping me when you respond otherwise this might drift a bit. yes ,0

7277,i have been observing this dispute for some time and i must admit until now only because it amused me.metta bubble i believe the problem here is that you started by advocating that user be given a break and then repeatedly told him that as a result of his efforts i believe this strategy will result in you getting blocked for being a dick. i know you were probably trying to avoid making a personal judgment yourself but by not making your views clear on this i.e. i personally dont believe you are a dick or i believe this would be the right thing to do you made your views clear by omission. its really hard to blame user for suddenly being upset with you. did not the buddha say when they meet a sorrowful man they should lament the bitterness of this everchanging world? user is clearly confused and sorrowful about wiki and was hoping for more of a constant in his advocate. you have to admit whatever you think of his approach the ethnicity section does read a lot better because of his efforts. peace.,0

7292, october utcif i made some error then why cant someone explain it to me on the talk page? i am not pushing a pov.i edited an inflammatory sentence about a jewish issue in the schlafly biography page. i think that the sentence is antijewish but you may have your own opinion. maybe you think the sentence is projewish. either way the sentence is contrary to wp blp policy and must be removed immediately unless it is reliably sourced.the source is a paragraph in a ny times book review by a jewish columnist. schlafly did not write the book in question and schlafly is not jewish. the book is not about jews. the paragraph is not backed up by anything. the paragraph is partially explained by the fact that columnist is jewish and likes to write about jewish issues. the paragraph is a criticism of the book and not a criticism of schlafly.i think that the sentence is too unsupported and too far removed and too strange to even be included in an article about schlafly. but if it is going to be there then it should stick to what the ny times columnist said. i believe that the sentence in dispute implies something about schlafly that is not stated in the ny times book review. that is what i argued on the talk page and no one rebutted that argument.blocking me is just a way to put a false and defamatory allegation about a living person in a wp article. it is wrong and those who put this jewrelated allegation in should be blocked not me. ,0

7307,exactly kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song behind these hazel eyes. comparing the pictures of kelly and belle they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it belles eyes are little lighter. someone made a video called behind belles hazel eyes the person who made this video knew what color belles eyes were and decided to include belles name in the title. and if you read the comments the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved. i like the problem solved part. with minotaurgirls bias against the idea of belle having hazel eyes i think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.tv tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her so much so they forbade users from writting what belles eye color is. notice how belles name is missing from the eye color tropes colony while the rest of disney princesses have their eye color mentioned. belles name was there under the category of hazel eyes until minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. same thing almost happened to disney wiki. this is minotaurgirls account as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite the reason inserting false information the false information being writting down belles eyes as brown. and now heres minotaurgirl on the wikipedia. is there any repsite from her?i noticed she has a live journal account. see what she has written. the lack of links speaks for itself. she thinks she actually proved belles eyes are brown depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie like the screenshots she send me. by magnifying the images you can see her eyes are hazelcolored and not the same color as her hair at all. notice how shes afriad to use closeups of belles eye cuz she knows theyll appear hazel if she did so thus disproving her. on her blog she didnt mention that she was blocked on disney wiki and said the only reason disney wiki kept belles eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel when in reality the one who got shut up was minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didnt. she wrote bleh. kids these days. this one needs a hobby. im tired of wasting time trying to undo this snots damage and im fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners? yup she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobbyless kids if the evidence goes against what minotaurgirl said/believes.if anyone deserves to be blocked its minotaurgirl. if it wasnt for her bias sites like like tv tropes disney wiki and the wikipedia wouldnt have suffered an edit war about belles eye color. the fact that there was never an edit about belles eye color until minotaurgirl came along says a lot. ever since she got blocked from disney wiki almost an year ago no edit war about belles eye color happened there either. its like minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept belles eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown just cuz she likes to think so not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. its like someone going around changing ariels eyes from blue to green just cuz he likes the idea of ariel being greeneyed. thinks dont work like that.my overall opinion on minotaurgurl. i think its safe to say the interent is better off without her. shes toxic shes a nuisance shes talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her she lies she mangles twists and misrepresents other peoples words and she causes edit wars. action needs to be taken against people like this. ,0

7370, i anticipated that is precisely what you would do. i see there is no need to respond there as you have been properly counseled by the first responder. take this under advisement there are editors on wikipedia it’s amazing the system runs as smoothly as it does. you need to do a self appraisal as to why you behave as you do. you strike me as the type who has to win at all cost. if that is indeed your underlying need it would help if you didn’t a go out of your way to provoke confrontation you might have elected to not post your very first unhelpful post and b not be so wrong about things in the first place read tony’s ¢. just take that under you don’t feel like you’ve been somehow disgraced and have some honor to defend or other such horsecrap you are perfectly free to delete this thread. if you don’t then i will in hours. please drop this now. i spent several hours making that animation and all i have as my reward is stepping ankledeep in my dealings with you. wikipedia is supposed to be a rewarding hobby. so far that attribute has been elusive the last hours or so here for me. happy editing.  talk ,0

7394,the primary mission as you call it of wikipedia should not be to obfuscate the truth and promote official dogma by labeling every idea that the establishment doesnt like as fringe. i dont see anything in your or gabriels claims that is any more enlightened or courageous or intelligent than the abuse and nonsense thrown at galileo by the vatican. you have your official truth supported by argument from authority illogic and everything else is conspiracy theories that are automatically suspect. ,0
7395,this is the most ridiculous nonsense ever. i honestly think that whoever is doing this needs to be reported to wikipedia. how can a local newspaper to egremont which is completely free of charge and carries important and relevant stories to the town be removed? what possible reason can you have other than i personally dont like links? you are denying visitors to the page a relevant source of information about the town those visitors sought out on wikipedia because of some petty and childish desire to seem official. you really should ask yourself whether removing this link was beneficial to visitors to wikipedia or whether you just denied them a source of relevant information.,0

7436,ralf reski may meet the criteria but if he does there is no evidence of that in the article. if he indeed does meet the criteria please add the evidence for this to the article. while it is true that these are just guidelines and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made. i’m not trying to prove that he isn’t notable i’m trying to determine if he is.as far as i can see the criteria are not met. the persons research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline broadly construed as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.i’m not a fan of citation metrics and they’re not the final word but the hindex is which is pretty average. the most cited paper does have over citations but that’s the moss genome sequence where he’s one of many authors. genome sequences always get lots of citations.. the person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.this may be true but the article does not mention it. i don’t think a heisenberg fellowship counts as ‘highly prestigious.. the person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association e.g. a national academy of sciences or the royal society or a fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor e.g. the ieee.again this may be true but isn’t mentioned in the article.. the persons academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education affecting a substantial number of academic institutions.no major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article.. the person holds or has held a named chair appointment or distinguished professor appointment at a major institution of higher education and research.no evidence for this is given in the article.. the person has held a major highestlevel elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society.from what i can see in the article the highest position he has held was dean of the faculty of biology. the person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.no evidence for this given in the article.. the person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major wellestablished academic journal in their subject area.only normal editorial board memberships given in the article.. the person is in a field of literature e.g writer or poet or the fine arts e.g. musician composer artist and meets the standards for notability in that art such as wpcreative or wpmusic.does not apply.if you can show that the criteria are met after all i’m happy to go along with it but just being a professor does not satisfy wpprof. cheers ,0

7449,hey there buddy i am backa quote from kenneth tennyson phd.the sad thing is that our fellow here freedom skies appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that he is educated it is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.firstly can you tell me what being american or british is? america and britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from italy ireland china guatemala and so forth. so if freedom skies is being proud of his culture is that evil? secondly you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. suggestion join the marine corps. that is one thing i have learned is understanding the world through travel. thirdly i am utterly shocked at your comment on freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing if not a scary thing. does that threaten you that indians are educated? please answer yes or no no need to give a disertation or oration thank you. also that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the southern part of america during the civil war used to consider blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. as a matter of fact it was illegal for an afroamerican to go to school or even learn to read since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. i will even go a further step to say that back then these racists from the colonial south felt threatened that the slaves would become a very powerful and scary radicalized community. regarding your previous posts here is some food for thought. in the marine corps as a gunny sgt. or someone in command if you are at a bar or a party you never show that you are drunk. if you are drunk you do not admit it... youre basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia and in some cases cases??? learn from that pal...,0

7453,water in the coliseumfwiw i watched a program on the history channel a couple of months ago the focus of which was a chemical study of the makeup of the plaster used in the coliseum and examination of the flooding and drainage facilities the romans had built into the coliseum.the program concluded that the plaster used contained small but notable amounts of the substance that the romans used in aqueducts for waterproofing but not enough that it was designed to be a permanent feature of the arena. it also concluded that the coliseum could have been flooded overnight and that it was probably built with it being flooded shortly after completion but not again after that in mind.i can’t find in the brief search i’ve just done anything i can cite so i’m not going to put it into the article yet but i’d say that the section relating to the flooding of the coliseum is probably slightly out of date.,0

7469,the previous comment makes several incorrect statements about baybayins status as a script the origin of its name and what sanskrit refers to. baybayin is a single script like latin arabic or devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. it is most definitely not a group or family of scripts no separate sulat bisaya ever existed and authentic kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of baybayin. there were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. scott villamor and especially santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region even from the same document shows moer differences than the socalled regional scripts written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. modern kulitan or súlat kapampangan is the recent invention of one person who took a th century french visitors interpretation of baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from pampanga and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of kawi and korean hangul. it is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. the name baybayin originated with tagalog speakers not the spanish who at first just called it sus letras their letters. baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order. sanskrit is a language not a script or group of scripts. all these facts can be checked in the existing literature. anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least paul morrows web site ang baybayin santamarías el baybayin en el archivo de santo tomas villamors the old philippine writing/la antigua escritura filipina and marcilla y martíns estudio de los antiguos alfabetos filipinos. ,0

7494,wow interesting information. first let me say that i dont doubt the truth of what youre saying. however because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source it qualifies as original research which is not permitted on wikipedia. typically this type of information would have to be removed from an article. given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation however ill leave it in with the citation needed tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon ill look tomorrow. i feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source however another editor could come along and justifiably remove it. if that happens we will have to find a source to add it again. · talk · ,0

7504,jeztah the explaination above that since the article of the war is called lebanon war and since that war only since has been called the first lebanon war only in and to israel then this war should be called lebanon war is incorrect and that logic is not supported by wikipedia policy. the lebanon has very little credentials as i am proving above. israelhezbollah war carries no pov implications the excuse named above is purely original and cannot be heard anywhere else in all seriousness. using his logic lebanon war would be incorrect since fighting began and took place in israel as well. israelhezbollah war meets the criteria of rule and . neither nor any other editor has come close to proving another single name. and c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict. way to make up wikipedia policy i do not appreciate that at at all. you know as an editor that that is purely and totally irrelevant. i agree that lebanon war isnt perfect but it is the closest to meeting wikipedia policy we have found thus far. also the c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict. is entirely relevant to wikipedia policy per naming conventions rule . it becomes quickly apparent to anyone doing even the minimum amount of research that israelhezbollah war doesnt meet rules or . it might meet rule though that is also disputable. — talk ,0

7565,it was not a personal attack but rather a racist remark about indians in general. no i did not accuse aniruph of being unfamiliar with the english language because he is indian his nationality was irrelevant. aniruph showed failure to use the english language correctly common practice among nonnative english speakers. i am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit wikipedia according to their own pov. aniruph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger indian demographic who subtly edit wikipedia pushing their own pov using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. there is a growing concern among a considerable number of white western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world the number of uneducated third world citizens with a pov agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. nationalism is a large factor in this and it isnt healthy for the wikipedia community. there is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks asians view the world differently than europeans and north americans. in my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing wikipedia in their native tongue the better. i will hold my hands up for my disliking of india and the indian population i have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them but not hatred. i pity india and its misfortune children die every day in india under the age of how sad. i find it amazing that inept little brown people can even use computers. ping me as a side note when a router is reset a new ip is given... so even though i may not be able to edit from this user name whats stopping me from editing wikipedia if i create a new user? even regional blocks dont work wikipedia needs to find real solutions to real problems. ping me ,0

7575,if you really beleive all that shia crap then good luck to you cuz youre gonna need it in life. you dont seem to have a solid grip on reality. you seem to live in your own world. anyhow i will give you a bit of clue free of charge. the reason there are some favourable hadiths for iranians is surprise surprise because out of the main hadith authors were iranians including the most authoritative ones bukhari termezi and hajjaj. nasai was also iranian. the first were khurasani and nasai was from pars. the other hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copyandpaste from the hadith of the iranian authors. hajjaj was from neyshapour but claimed to be of qushayri origin so that he was better accepted as some real arab from an authentic arabic origin but there is academic information that he was indeed of khorasani origin and his claim of alqushayri roots is unverifiable. the most authoritative of the hadiths is albukhari from the city of bukhara. having read what you wrote for me i have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and i am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. so i let you be happy by deleting the forced out of the article and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that shahrbanoo indeed chose husayn and they lived happily ever after and both ali and muhammad knew persian and shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today their educated people are like you i can imagine what the uneducated ones are like feb utc,0

7591,in point of fact the plot summary unaccountably omits the key revelation that implicates phelps as the real mole and mastermind behind the murders of ethans team i.e. ethans discovery after his argument with krieger in the london hotel that the bible he has been consulting to communicate with max was originally from the drake hotel in chicago. this points the finger at phelps being in the prague safe house prior to his purportedly first meeting with the team to discuss the mission and where he incidentally mentions his stay at the drake. the crucial relevance of this is made obvious at the time of its discovery and is later confirmed during the showdown in the baggage department when phelps asks ethan when he knew and then remarks damn gideons ,0

7607,the net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content plus which there is more to say about each individual rate construction particulars for instance plus it doesnt work with the categorization system. when thinking about merging articles one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because its new and needs more content or it will always be small. in the case of the rn rates all have much to say about them rationale evolution employment plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. this article should be about the system as a whole who introduced it and why? when did it go out of use? how did it compare to other nations systems? once you have adequate treatment of all that plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate thats a pretty hefty article no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of thirdrate. when considering organization like this its worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned and maybe query the editors who set it up because what youve effectively done is to destroy article structure that i and others carefully set up some time ago. talk pages are mostly used for debate so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly no need to discuss. sep utc,0

7610,karamu high schoolhi gadfium thank you for starting the page on karamu hs but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the karamu hs bot will now administer information for the site. thanks —preceding unsigned comment added by ... you are welcome to edit the article but you cannot control it. please add only information which can be sourced. you also cannot copy information directly from the internet unless that information is under a suitable open content licence usually ccbysa. for the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable you will have to place such a licence statement on that page. otherwise you are violating the schools copyright. there are alternatives such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material which would have to go to someone higher in wikipedia than me. its much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website. you can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs.i suggest you always edit using an account since your ip address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person. you should also use an account representing a single person not the whole bot. see wporgname.finally you have a conflict of interest on the article. this doesnt prevent you from making purely factual edits but you should not attempt to promote the school by for example using peacock phrases. it gets tricky if there is material critical of the school in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly. i accepted the removal of the section on the ero crisis which was unsourced and out of date although quite interesting. that was not critical of your school but i think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.gadfium thanks for the message. not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this wiki. are you a past pupil? the bot are confused why you are seeking to edit the wiki when the school and the bot are the legal owners of the school and its information. quite happy to stick within the guidelines of wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg generally regarded by residents as less conservative where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim? who decides karamus alumni? all information on our website has been written with bot delegated authority and is the proprty of the bot so no problems there. will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when i have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for khs is simply not an accurate information page for khs in and the bot are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... i am not a former student at the school. i edit wikipedia on many subjects mostly to do with new zealand. i am concerned that articles be accurate but i also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles.you are probably correct that the bot owns the school. it probably also owns the copyright on the school website. it clearly does not own all information about the school and it does not own any wikipedia article. we cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the schools website to wikipedia simply because they claim to represent the bot unless we have proof that they actually do so. to put any material on wikipedia is to licence it under wikipedias terms of use which is under a ccbysa licence. i am not allowing the material to be added to wikipedia verbatim without such proof because i am protecting the schools copyright. the simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to wikipedia and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute wikipedias content is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released,0

7690,i would be glad to noformation. a conflict of interest is defined as where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of wikipedia. the aims of wikipedia is to produce a neutral reliably sourced encyclopedia. my position is that editors from the rationalskeptic wikiproject and their ilk are not neutral in this subject and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture no specialist dedicated learning in it have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature and they are illequiped to provide a full rounded mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.now as for myself i will tell it straight i work hours per week in acupuncture practice earning $ per hour. acupuncture practice is not my main source of income in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. it requires hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline and one day i aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.i refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified have the most experience have done the most study and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of coi. in fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable far more valuable than the input of ivorytower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical critical and dismissive point of view. in fact considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page which emulates the tone of those quackwatch websites that proliferate on the web these days and considering their devoted following of edzard ernst and their elevation of his work as the number source on the page literally and their transparent agenda of debunking the pseudoscience they consider acupuncture to be it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are advancing outside interests rather than being neutral and thus they in breach of coi as opposed to i. ,0

7698, recuplex hello tungilikunfortunately you cannot even tough you work and have access information at the city of north battleford because no original research says original research used on wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts allegations and ideas—for which no reliable published sources exist which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per general notability guideline.make sure that your sources must be reliable if you want to know if a source is reliable. wpsource says a source material must have been published the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. unpublished materials are not considered reliable you can use universitylevel textbooks books published by respected publishing houses magazines journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. never use blogs as sources as wpnewsblog says never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. for personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.wikipedia strongly prefer free files wherever possible. when no free file exist it sometimes to ask a permission to use a nonfree copyrightprotected file under the fair use provision. ideally most free files should be uploaded to wikimedia commons instead of wikipedia. in uploading images only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. now you first find out whether the image is legal in the united states where the wikipedia servers are located also if the image has not been released to your knowledge under a license and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. next if youre finish determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.in the procedure of uploading it you can upload an image by using the upload file link on the left side of the main page under toolbox. use good filenames because some filenames such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras are disallowed and attempting to use them will generate an error message.example of good file names imagecity of london skyline from london city hall oct sir john betjeman .jpgexample of bad file names i hope this helps in improving your article i know it is a little bit complicated but you can ask questions at the teahouse with more experienced editors in the wiki. good luck ,0

7867,show n tella question for it may seem an odd question to wp purists but considering the importance wp places on reliability of secondary sources why does wp not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves? the entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation. for all i know i could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented mind gameplaying geek living in inner mongolia. it is imperative in my mind that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence as i have of their actual ability credibility reliability accountability... their authority to control. if its required of the sources it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them. similarly how do i call for consensus? who may be a member and how is each identified? thanks in advance... thats the beauty of wikipedia. anyone can edit it. thats the point. you have no more authority than any other editor here regardless of your credentials. also anyone can participate when trying to achieve consensus. just remember its not the number of people but the strength or the arguments that matter. darian ,0

7870,hi eric no. you are not in any way one of the people i was talking about. you just got caught in the crossfire and if i made you think i was thinking of you i apologise. your work is consistent good plus even more importantly you have a sensitivity to other peoples work with a few people dont. you build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. the people i was talking about arrive at an article chop it around change meanings change context spelling capitalisation and then move on more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. for example one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles frequently changes it to taoiseachs a nonexistent word. he has tried to change governorsgeneral to governorgenerals prime minister to prime minister. he changed links from president of ireland to president of ireland links to the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ie the form of uk between and to united kingdom of great britain and ireland so linking the reference to the wrong uk. he mucked up some links to tánaiste deputy irish prime minister by lowercasing it changed a series of mentions of first lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady changed one mention of garret fitzgerald to garrett fitzgerald removed the word óg from gearóid og fitzgerald and mór from gearóid mór fitzgerald not grasping that they actually were two different people mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father óg meaning small meant his son and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. that is just some of my work he has mucked up. he made a complete mess of some biology articles reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author one of the worlds top mediæval historians quick wiki in disgust. i know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. and there are quite a few such people. not a lot but enough to mangle everything they touch. another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in th century history on the basis of google searches. i checked on google. the majority of articles said he was right. those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. but she treated google as sacrosanct. if a google search said it it was gospel. i have had political science articles which i have written and which were based on hard fact in mediocre garbage applying wrong capitalisation again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays wrong spelling wrong interpretation etc. i wasnt reacting simply to the droop quota at all that was the sixth article that day i had done that had been hit. in that case michael hardy as he is prone to do swept in to a topic he knows little about changed capitalisation text and even the formula which is the standard dq formula taught in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula. that intervention was classic michael go onto a page about a topic he doesnt know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that unilaterally change it in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.american english and british english use different approaches to capitalisation. many of the references were to things only found outside the us and so capitalised. instead he insisted on applying us capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the us. that indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. apart from its general unreliability most website mentions in the us are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply us capitalisation to things that dont exist in the us and are capitalised internationally. a classic example is the electoral system proportional representation using the single transferable vote. michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. isnt used in the us and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system and lowercased when used generically. where it is mentioned on google it is largely on the basis of americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit american english. so michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation then another us user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the us. so any nonamerican user would get r,0

7876,thank you not sure how else to contact you. hope you dont mind me posting here. thank you for reviewing my unblock request. i appreciate your taking the time to examine the issue in order to make what i needless to say think was a fair judgment.as i already expressed on the talk page prior to the day block its proven futile for me to try to maintain the agreed version pending revision through further discussion and consensus as my efforts to undo the reverts of people who refuse to make any kind of effort to discuss their objections on talk continually well twice prior to this day thing which doesnt count on this point result in me getting blocked. thus as i said on talk im going to stick with helping get his rewrite ready. i hope admins will continue to monitor the six day war article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensusforming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions etc. if you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard i would appreciate it. and its probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. i trust my decision to let other editors whom i discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed versions will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me. i just want to see this article improved including by keeping it in compliance with wpnpov. thanks again. cheers.,0
7877,i keep wondering why you coming here arguing with me when you make no sense at all? dont you realize that many people might be coming to see this discussion here? you are basically telling everyone here not to trust the cia bbc united nations chart that is posted above which is also posted at bbc and that everyone should trust your map which was made by an unknown person. first of all i am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. i never changed the numbers rather i changed and replaced the old hard to read and understand map of yours. my map the one above explains little more about each ethnic group while yours does not. demographics of afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. by watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in afghanistans article there must be something you are up to. also something i noticed you keep talking about the numbers of pashtuns should be lower which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. i will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. i wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as i find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. you keep reminding that pashtuns killed this pashtuns killed that why dont you discuss about pashtuns always being killed by invaders. they have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. this law is practiced in all the countries of the world. by now ive already realized that you are not just a traitor to afghanistan but also a true enemy of pashtuns. i have allah almighty god on my side and thats why i always win.,0

7910,that actually sounds quite reasonable. keep in mind that ive been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway offwikipedia before i was blocked.its refreshing to see some true civility for a change. especially after having had four different admins block me actually its probably more than the last four without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so. then theres the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smokefilled back room.duk and haukur were decent and know more about what theyre talking about because weve been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past even ive locked horns with both of them at various times weve managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings cant say that for everyone else involved.mostly however what ive much of anything not even remotely resembling civility in this entire process. at least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized magicincantation wikipediajargon meaning of that term. its no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it it has nothing whatsoever to do with realworld concepts of civility as they use it.your proposal was so much in a different vein that it catches me by surprise. the fact that i am surprised might be a cause for concern.,0

7919, more on wiki writers many errors have been corrected in wikipedias roman salute article. the article had many visits from dr. curry in the past see its talk page as dr. curry attempted to correct the many errors.however the wikipedia article on the roman salute is becoming more dishonest by the week. an earlier version referenced the work of professor rex curry and started thusly the roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight with palms down. sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. the salute was supposed to have been used in the roman republic but there is no clear evidence of this. indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in roman culture by paul barlow. a more recent version of the same article is written as if a neonazi has been coveringup again.a big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase roman salute and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.the article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of dr. curry conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the roman republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in roman culture.the wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient rome. there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of roman images. there is as much evidence that after dr. currys shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted roman images in order to coverup and suppress professor currys discoveries. the wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient rome. there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of roman images. there is as much evidence that after dr. currys shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to coverup and suppress professor currys discoveries. for example there is no evidence that jacqueslouis david actually thought that his painting the oath of the horatii represented an actual historical roman salute. all of the evidence indicates that david created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. all of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. the intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by dr. curry further the horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.the tennis court oath was painted by david later and repeats davids use of the dramatic gesture that david concocted but in a more modern setting. there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. david was not there. further the oath was was written on paper the paper being read by the central figure? and the oath was taken by signing the document. there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting the central figure might be swearing or he might be reading his document while those people about him waive hats talk holler point etc. three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the horatii painting. the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.the distribution of the eagle standards was painted by david even later and repeats davids use of the dramatic gesture that david concocted but in another modern setting. there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all. the wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings. that painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oathtaking or at all and simply shows various people with various gestures acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for and shouting for the eagle standards. the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.the wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straightarm g,0

7925, four years after writing my vision is that wikipedia should not say e is a fool when all it can really say is that d has called e a fool lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article. the preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the eucharist in last supper and cites the catholic catechism and orthodox encyclopedia and an anglican bishop. reading the footnotes one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis. and instead of reproducing quotes faithfully or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors without even selective quotation.on the positive side im learning a lot about eucharistnot from this wikipedia article i have to say as much as running down footnotesi never knew the eucharist was announced before the last supper until i read in the catholic catechism. that tidbit doesnt appear in any wikipedia article i read.the last supper is the institution of the eucharist to catholic not the origin according to the catholic catechism cited here from .yet you couldnt tell it from our little article ,0

7944,=recent deletionsi have removed various references to songs that contain the progression for only very short irrelevant sections of the songs. why? so glad to answer. the source given is music notes sheet music which is a website that produces and sells arrangements of songs and nowhere states to be a faithful record of the song as written. the music notes snippet shown is not enough to show that the song generally uses or does not use this fourchord convention. the music notes are basically just appended on with no proof whatsoever that they show that the song uses the fourchord progression. i could find the sheet music for any musical work you can think ofsay beethovens ninthand just tack on the music notes. nobodys going to pay five bucks to read it myself included to verify. those very same music notes do not even uphold the articles assertion in cases like dont stop believing. see measure ? thats a gm chorda iii chord which is not in the poppunk progression. g in the bass with g b and d in the treble. straight up gm chord. definitely a iii.ill be restoring the removals presently i guess. slash ,0

7948,some of these things i have already changed or deleted. a province really does not have a monetary policy though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash and the phrase was too general to begin with so thats gone. i changed did nothing to stop to did not work to stop though your criticism is valid. note however that when de la rúa took office argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. then came the corralito etc. on the whole the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the imf were recommending them. i dont remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. note also that economic collapse doesnt refer only to the critical period november february but to the whole recessive period and some time before and after. we should agree on a phrase that links de la rúas measures with the crisis without falling into any of... did not work to stop the economic collapse.... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.... ultimately caused the economic collapse.... were intended to cause the economic collapse. ... had nothing to do with the economic collapse then the importdependent thing. consider this right after the devaluation neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. the public hospital where i worked initially could not get xray film from the providers and then only by paying in cash and in dollars. argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. id say thats rather importdependent though we may be speaking of different things. what do you propose?whats the problem with the religious aspects of the supreme justices? the previous justices were all old male and ideologically conservative and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the catholic church. and now two of them are women one is the president of the court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. the clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the supreme court were really important. argibays atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. in a country where the church attacks anyone who dares speak of womens rights having these two women at the top of one of the countrys government branches is extremely significant.the qualification historical for the payment to the imf is that correct me if im wrong argentina had never decided to pay so much to the imf or anyone else not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule and this payment has redefined the relationship of argentina with the imf and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment.im glad were discussing this here civilly. understand that noone here is that i know affiliated with a party or a person if someone is it doesnt show and that we dont have an ideological police or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic you have to consider that most of the content is settled already and should be treated carefully to avoid being or being seen as disruptive. its perfectly ok for us to discuss over the tiniest details here.please sign after your comments and replies here using four tildes . when you save the page theyll be converted to your username and current date/time. its easier to keep track that way. talk ,0

7961,thom hartmann states that in germany ... people fill in handmarked ballots which are handcounted by civil servants watched over by volunteer representatives of the political parties. ... its totally clean and easily audited. and even though it takes a week or more to count the vote ... the german people know the election results the night the polls close because the news media’s exit polls for two generations have never been more than a tenth of a percent off.unfortunately hes wrong. generally all votes are counted twice by midnight. then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not. they have a week to reply and then the final results are announced its got nothing to do with counting votes for a week btw. the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other. this year a candidate died in dresden after the ballots had been finalised and therefore the precinct voted two weeks? later,0

7965,my two centsfirst of all let me just say that im very happy xandar is no longer blocked and i look forward to working together on improving the article in the next few days. this place just isnt the same without xandar. on the substance of the criticism i agree on some points but disagree on the fundamentals. in particular im rather shocked that xandar suggests we should remove history which is the most important section of the article. its almost impossible to rationally justify such a reckless suggestion. the proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire as people repeatedly documented. i categorically reject these proposals by xandar but im willing to work on including some more material through summary style which would mean greater coverage of topics that xandar wants mentioned in the article while also keeping down the length. talk ,0

8009,this is becoming very tiresome. after the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person rothbard happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral rothbard returned to remove an important qualifying word some and to change parliament to government and to delete documenting links. that shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government. regarding the first point to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize islam or christianity and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize the antiwar movement. that is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise. regarding the second point in a parliamentary system the word government refers to prime minister and cabinet not to members of parliament. to advise government you are advising the prime minister. nothing states that palmer ever met the prime minister but he spoke to members of the parliament. rothbard is perhaps no political scientist but there is a major difference between them. even under the american system if someone speaks to members of the congress it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to washington to advise the government. we had reached a compromise and rothbard indicated that he could live with it but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading. the agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. the issue is raised and its time for rothbard to simply back off. others here will have to revert his attempt to introduce errors into this entry. ,0
8010,the poobotsdam declaration wethe undersigned representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls have conferred and agree that wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.the prodigious land sea and air forces of the undersigned many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west are poised to strike the final blows upon wikipedia. this military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the allied vandals to prosecute the war against wikipedia until she ceases to resist.the result of the futile and senseless chanting fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of wikipedia. the might that now converges on japan is immeasurably greater than that which when applied to the resisting nazis necessarily laid waste to the lands the industry and the method of life of chanting fox and lucky .. the full application of our military power backed by our resolve will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the wiki foundation.the time has come for wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those selfwilled militaristic advisers e.g. jpgordon durvova jdforrester sandstein organgemike bigdunc alison rodhullandemu whose unintelligent calculations have brought the wikipedia foundation to the threshold of annihilation or whether she will follow the path of reason.following are our terms. we will not deviate from them. there are no alternatives. we shall brook no delay.there must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of wikipedia into embarking on world conquest for we insist that a new order of peace security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that wikipedia’s warmaking power is destroyed pages in article space to be designated by the allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of honshu hokkaido kyushu shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.the wikipedia military forces after being completely disarmed shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.we do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking checkusering and protection tools. the wikipedia foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst wikipedians. freedom of speech of religion and of thought as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind but not those which would enable her to rearm for war. to this end access to as distinguished from control of raw materials shall be permitted. eventual wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.the occupying forces of the vandals shall be withdrawn from wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.we call upon jimbo wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all wikipedian armed forces and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. the alternative for wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction....,0

8026, narciso yepess revolutionary technical developments this is a story that has been recounted numerous times by yepes and by his students you know the guitar is a very unusual instrument for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar someone whos genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. however i have never felt that way about myself. when i was around i could play virtually everything written for the guitar but i knew i needed a teacher so i went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of vicente ascencio a very famous man in spain. the first thing he asked me to play was a musical scale. i played a standard guitar scale using alternating i and m fingers and i played it about as well as any guitarist i had ever heard. ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. he played a scale on the piano which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. then he picked up a violin and played a scale much faster than i could play. he showed me a musical scale on several other orchestral instruments and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if i was to be a musician. i tried again to match his accepted norm for scales but i could not do so. i then told him that this could not be done on the guitar and in fact no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. he told me too bad but if you want to study music with me you must give up the guitar. i expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm. well i had two choices. one was to be the genuis of the guitar to get mad and storm out the door. the other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept ascencio as my teacher where i would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. fortunately i chose to stay and learn for the door was open for ascencio to be my teacher and i chose to swallow my pride and study with him and this decision has made all the difference. i went home thought about scales and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. i started using three fingers instead ami mia iam and the next week i was able to play a musical scale. he smiled and told me that i did not have to give up the guitar after all. then he asked me for a chromatic scale in rds and again the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. by the next week i had figured out a way to play rds at the accepted tempo. thus we went week after week and i continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. eventually i had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. as a result of the experience i have come to understand one thingthe minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.you may also wish to look up yepess threefingered scales/trills techniques . most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again. but it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and as all great ideas so simple and logical it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before yepes ever realized this theory. and that is just one of the many new techniques yepes invented. you may add your citation needed comments to call this into question but it will not take away the facts of yepess achievements.,0
8027,problems with articlelet me see...what does the article tell us about gamos? it is an organisation whether a group of volunteers random nomads or a business is unclear. it does though have enabling frameworks with a named uk governmental group. the nature of an enabling framework is not specified. perhaps it just means financial connections? the referenced corporation website ah gamos must be a corporation is filled with similarly nonspecific language. why is it notable? well apparently because it somehow provoked a multi donor action dealing with african phones. one assumes that this sort of provocation is a good thing but this is not quite clear. and further it was in some fashion responsible for a good practice paper....please someone this article desperately need rewriting. it is not really intelligible as it is. plus even though some references have been provided to indicate that gamos exists there is very little there to show any significant notability. i am replacing the notability tag. talk ,0

8046, april you should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. this applies to articles about you your achievements your band your business your publications your website your relatives and any other possible conflict of interest. creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. if you create such an article it might be listed on articles for deletion. deletion is not certain but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. this is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. all edits to articles must conform to wikipediano original research wikipedianeutral point of view and wikipediaverifiability. if you are not notable under wikipedia guidelines creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion. if your achievements etc. are verifiable and genuinely notable and thus suitable for inclusion in wikipedia someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. see wikipediawikipedians with articles. ,0
8047,to view the details on the netto site click the above link and click about netto in the bottom right corner. since netto is a danish store i assume that the numbers on the danish page are the most updated and that the other country pages are translated from it. talk arson the keighley store was destroyed by arson as well in about . of course before it burnt down baked beans were p. after it burnt down they went up to p because they were cooked.lol is that a joke or is it serious? if joking its funnyit is true that the keighley store burned down it moved out to crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. the bean prices though were just a joke that were being passed around at the time. request for info review ive just had a look at this selection and i dont think it should belong in this article. this is the sectionthe cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. the fire broke out at around am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. the fire was not completely put out until about pm. it is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. it is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there as to insult the receiver due to netto being known for its cheapness. my view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at netto. i personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely? the schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article. this is an encyclopedia not a local news paper please let me know your views because i am tempted to remove it no responses so i gather we are in agreement. if not please post a comment on my discussion page thanks,0

8061,kimberly billett while first reading this article i was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. however as the article progressed i continued to see an increasing amount of methods both right and wrong that i recognized from first hand experience. throughout high school i was continuously asked to tutor children typically students between first and fourth grade and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. the children i tutored especially the younger ones found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. originally i found this frustrating but reading this article and in particular the section on the ‘mr. short and mr. tall’ experiment made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. i am also studying astronomy in which we are studying newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. that being said i think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing for instance the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by ^ and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.,0

8090, error becoming acceptable the most common error that i see regarding the use or misuse of the plural noun is the use of the word emails. email meaning electronic mail is both singular and plural. someone may receive one piece of mail email or many pieces of mail email. since it would be incorrect to say i received lots of mails it is just as incorrect to say i received lots of emails. the problem i see with this is that the use of emails has spawned a growing acceptance of the misuse of plural nouns in general. it is amazing to see in both the written and spoken word how educated people increasingly misuse the plural noun. for example take some time on any given day and listen to the dribble that comes out of the mouths of news reporters. it is atrocious what you will hear when you are paying attention.i wonder where it will end?robertbrandon fl,0

8095,this is ridiculous such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines. it isnt my fault that you cant see the obvious. i havent seen you blocking grandmaster when he accused azizbekov of being a sock claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. azizbekov was consequently banned when vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. neither have i seen you block him when antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock again without any evidences provided. as a consequence andranik was also banned. i have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. i also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned like those of grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock which is the case with ehud. and i will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all this condition is unacceptable. and i will not be contesting my block either. i know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. i dont expect anything anymore. its plain fishy vartan gets the restriction i get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with atabek.it should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sockpuppetry especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. furthermore a block should be preceded by an official warning on the users page with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. a simple request on other pages doesnt satisfy this. and also just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sockpuppet doesnt mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry. ,0

8120,there was a lengthy discussion here n.b. im not joking when i say lenghty please be careful if attempting to read it all where some editors involved agreed that citing the film as a primary source is acceptable and others did not. there is a template templatecite video that can be used to cite a video available though a url but obviously youd have to be sure that the url steers clear of wikipediacopyright violations. personally i would suggest not to use the film as a source for this sort of thing because secondary sources are always better if available. also you want to avoid violating wpsynth which is done when you present a conclusion that you reached yourself by citing a primary source. but if you do decide to cite the film as a source you can use reference from this version of children of men as a guide of how to format a citation to the actual film. talk • contribs ,0

8162, july utc no i didnt liken you to a dog. thats just an expression that means things are going downhill iow civil fringe pov pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more in spite of recent improvements in the way were supposed to handle fringe beliefs. in this case allowing a onesided pov driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. that was indeed uncivil and very impolite. bang done no discussion or request. i am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone i respected. thats all. was what i said uncomfortable for you? sure but not incivil. you have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. you do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. when youre getting your way you are very tough and civil. somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments incivil. you really do misuse that card by playing it too often. when you become perfect then you can start pointing fingers. keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil pov pusher. as i recall you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to npov by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer stonewall and censure anything negative about chiropractic no matter how well sourced when were actually supposed to follow the sources. thats just wrong. since this is tims user page its probably best that this discussion not continue here or even continue at all since we never get anywhere. i just wanted to set the record straight that i certainly wasnt comparing you to a dog. i actually do have much higher opinions of you. i admire intelligence. i just wish it wasnt being used for such a nefarious and and nonnpov purpose as to protect chiropractics reputation. in the real world that is good from your pov chiro advocacy and protectionism but here we follow the sources and let them speak. ,0

8176,some faecal matter hi mathonius. i am no expert on human faeces like yourself but i was wondering why content like this is allowed on toilet paper but not in the anal cleansing section of human feces elsewhere wealthy people wiped themselves with wool lace or hemp while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags wood shavings leaves grass hay stone sand moss water snow maize ferns may apple plant husks fruit skins or seashells and corncobs depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. in ancient rome a sponge on a stick was commonly used and after usage placed back in a bucket of saltwater. several talmudic sources indicating ancient jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles often carried in a special bag and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs e.g. shabbat a a yevamot b. these are all cited in the classic biblical and talmudic medicine by the german physician julius preuss eng. trans. sanhedrin press .ideas? ...,0

8178,i agree with that “georgian scripts“ would be a better title or perhaps “georgian alphabets” or “georgian writing” although this might be confused with georgian literature. i certainly agree with the proposer that the present name is unsatisfactory as the article covers three distinct scripts and at least alludes to the existence of more than one mkhedruli alphabet. that said i don’t have a strong objection to “georgian script” which would at least be an improvement and seems to line up with the latin and cyrillic articles the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating in comprising a range of regional historical varieties.— ,0
8179,whilst dr. beck asked only that we take down the bdiii i still have to pay $ a copy for the original bdii so i must assume thats under copyright and licence as well. im going to try and find some relevant bits from wpc to justify or not removing the links. from what i can see the relevant text is here linking to copyrighted worksexternal sites can possibly violate copyright. linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone elses copyright. if it is please do not link to the page. knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the united states intellectual reserve v. utah lighthouse ministry. also linking to a page that illegally distributes someone elses work sheds a bad light on us. if the site in question is making fair use of the material linking is fine.from what i can tell i think that the sites that are hosting the bdii and bdiii are violating copyright. most of them dont say that they have permission to use the instrument they dont cite the original paper and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with harcourt individually but it seems unlikely. a lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects i dont think there is an exemption for educational use but then university psychology departments often buy a portfolio of test copyrights for limited use. this would not normally extend to use on the web however. in terms of next steps i actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go but rather we could list the issue at wpcp?if its an issue of helping depressed people im not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. after all it just produces a number its only useful in context. one option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . for instance moodgym is a site which allows users to selfadminister cognitive behavioral strategies .will go next to typewritten letter from oliver sacks about cycad toxicity in guam and the link to als... ,0

8210,omg you are an imbecile. seriously. lets go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.i rewrote the contribution using only information that i found on the internet that supported the contribution. i did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source. you on the other hand wrote a contribution that did add content to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source making it your opinion. you said things like ... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of arvadas police force.this is libelous because you accuse the arvada police department of criminal conduct when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law. even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found not guilty by your peers. because no one is convicted in the link you provide or any link anywhere on the internet it is your opinion. if you had used the phrase alleged criminal conduct you would be more on track.you also wrote arvadas city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the arvada police despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone during a period of budget crises.the close to half a million dollars was not spent defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone. the money was spent settling out of court so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact. a criminal is someone who has been convicted of a crime. so there cannot be criminal actions unless someone has been convicted of a crime. there can be alleged questionable actions which is what you should have written. when you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion that opens you up to a libel suit. if you do it in a blog and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel. but when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content you cannot just post what you think. you must post what can be verified. do you understand this very basic principle? please read it again if you dont because im done trying to educate you.definition of libel i encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. in the united states opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech falling outside the purview of libel. citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities including government and officials. entertainment parody editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. from how to prove libel there are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. for example in the united states the person first must prove that the statement was false. second that person must prove that the statement caused harm. and third they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. these steps are for an ordinary citizen. you are unable to be objective about the content you are writing because you have a personal emotional feeling or opinion about it. because of this you have no business contributing to wikipedia and its my opinion that you should be banned from doing so. ive made several contacts on this issue and am waiting to hear back.````,0

8263,actually to clarify....after bret hart was forced to vacate the world titleand retire due to a concussion the planned hart vs sid vicious title match was changed less than hours before the match to sid vs benoit. since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish and then build to the rematch at superbrawl the next month. so benoit won the matchwith sids leg clearly on the ropes and then the next night on nitro the decision was overturned. the official result of the sould out main event was chris benoit and sid vicious fought to a nocontest. end of story. except not. pissed off at the shitty booking benoit confronted booker kevin sullivanwho benoit had a personal history with re nancy. sullivan then told benoit if he didnt like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the wwf. the difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before benoit won the title thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his pinning the wrong harris. officially at the time the belt went from hart to a vacant state to kevin nash awarding the belt to himself........okay so vinnie mac has bought at wcw and recognised both benoits and sids first wins as world title wins. he has also recognised hulk hogans two awa dusty finishes as official world title wins. i dont like it but i guess its official now. the obvious question is since vince owns wwe wcw ecw and awa can he say overturn david arquettes wcw world title win at this point? thats just stupid.the sandmanthe sandman won the ecw championship five times not one as the article showswwa world titlewhere did it go?,0

8297,m going to approve it on the basis that the level for approval is a likelihood of passing afd. in this case the likelihood is probably a little better than even. you could improve the article by using a fuller format for references see wprefbegin but that would include the author and title of each item the printed source if any and the online linkeven if the online link is behind a paywall. if it is it will help to give some indication of the extent of coveragethe objections is likely to be that the nyt refs gave him a mere mention. there are two places where specific references are definitely neededi marked them. the claim for his role in the creation of build america bonds seems quite indirect unless he specifically is given credit in a source it might amount to original research which we do not do. id fix these quicklyit is usual for articles on candidates who do not win elections to be nominated for an afd discussion. and be aware that we have feeling of skepticism against articles with an obvious conflict of interest. talk ,0
8298,. this last summary is partly from chapters two three and four in haslett b. b. samter w. . children communicating the first years. mahwah n.j. lawrence erlbaum associates inc. the main idea for chapter two nonverbal communication its origins and development is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction facial expressions and modifying emotional expressiveness. with age childrens encoding sending messages and decoding interpreting messages skills increase. yet children are better at decoding than at encoding a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production haslett b. b. samter w. p. . this fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. the main point for chapter three the development of language is the social development based on the environment of the child. childrens nonverbal communication skills especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication. haslett b. b. samter w. p. good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication mainly nonverbal and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. this chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. the stages include prelinguistic development speech perception/production semantic development private speech and first words. also the main idea for chapter four developing verbal communication and how its relevant in childrens acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. a main focus is discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development for infants emerging abilities to control their communicative skills haslett b. b. samter w. p. . all three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children. ,0

8312,can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty. im certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as problematic. five weeks ago i was getting involved in wikipedia and i was feeling enthusiastic so i posted something to some user groups reaching + members encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia. i thought at the time that longtime wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people and that wikipedians would be happy that i encouraged others to participate. i was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute. the groups i posted to were user groups not employee groups. but yes i guess that some employees belong to these groups as well. and my comment about hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal pov is that he found a good way for someone with coi to contribute. i feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. it is unwelcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors. i see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding. i think that even if i only have time to make a small number of contributions i feel i am helping and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia. so seeing your criticism that i am not making enough edits to noncommercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.i hate feeling that i have to defend my reputation here and i dont agree with you that editing noncommercial pages should improve anyones appearance of trustworthiness. however your claim that i am only editing the wikipedia entries of these commercial products is also just incorrect. i dont know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others but if there is you would see that ive been making edits to many noncommercial pages including crispdm data mining the journal data mining and knowledge discovery predictive analytics statistics customer retention predictive model markup language anomaly detection semma machine learning jacques cousteau sigkdd decision tree learning. sometimes im making simple formatting edits and sometimes im spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the crispdm page. yes my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining because that is where i have the greatest interest and knowledge. similarly when i guest lecture at local universities i lecture to these types of classes not due to any collusion but because thats what i know.thanks for listening to my minirant. i know im taking this more personally than you probably meant it. but it bothers me when someone questions that i am not working hard enough or they question my ethics and thats what your comments feel like. all im asking is that longestablished wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions however small. new people grow and adjust but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community. please be patient and encouraging to new people.im going to leave this discussion now. if needed i will return to it after the holiday season. but i hope there is no need to. ,0

8323,sure. i dont have the necessary knowledge to correct these sections. the most egregious error is the following statement his system of government which may be described as a benevolent despotism was perhaps that best suited to the character of his subjects. this passive construction raises the questions benevolent for whom? described by whom? it implies that the montenegrins were unable to govern themselves and needed a wise father to gently raise them into civilization. if this is true it needs a citation but im sure there were plenty of trade unionists and republicans who disagreed at least slightly the following phrases read as excessively fawning slightly biased or perhaps just worded in an oldfashioned stylethe young highlander whose keen patriotism capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves showed no inclination for the pleasures of the french capital and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.he gave montenegro its first constitution in following pressure from a population eager for more freedom.king nikola was gifted with a fine physique and a commanding presence was a successful military leader and a graceful poeti hope this helps so that someone who has the knowledge to do the edits can update the article accordingly.,0

8325,i think lordameth has good point and i wish koreans and japanese would come to terms that they are not that different. the solution is either that koreans forgive japan for what happened or for japan to apologize and do what germans did. neither is happening and frankly itd make more sense for japanese to do their part first than the koreans. as far as authoritarian violent gov is concerned dont be a naivete japan has its own agenda and so do all the other countries involved. its korean necks that are on the line and many of them smarter than all of us statistically speaking feel that japan is a bigger threat than then i guess it is unless japan assuages korean sentiment which is pretty easy to do in practice.,0
8326,if they destroy each other they both dont live up to it. irresistable force means nothing can stop it. immovable means the object cant be moved. in both cases beign destroyed contradicts that. something like that means it was a powerful force meeting an equally resistant object. the problem is the adjectives that are absolute. just like the god examples and the greek dog. god cant be absolute if he cant do everything. creating something he cant oppose is something so if he cant do it he isnt absolute but then if he can then he isnt abosolute because he cant oppose it and so cant do everything. laelaps was a dog that always gets what it hunts but jupiter turned it into a static star while it was hunting a fox. since it cant ever move again it cant ever catch the fox and so it doesnt always get what it hunts.,0

8374,as a matter of curiosity==as a matter of curiosity if a person with a circumcision fetish found his way to this article would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? by the way the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page of the who pamphlet global trends would indicate that the purported hiv protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. would that also target the englishspeaking readers of a wiki site like wikipedia? ... anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the gilgal fellows perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. i have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world african hiv studies on our modern audience to no avail. thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. since there are a number of fellows who edit this article it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the gilgal fellows described here it could be revelatory for circumcision wikipedia to include a section on the gilgal fellows who apparently have quite a mission. its my understanding that gilgal is an obscure word for mountain of burning foreskins. no one having objected to the proposed sections on circumcision fetish and the gilgal fellows i will assume a consensus delegate the research and get back here with it asap. its impossible to assess such a vague proposal. if you provide some specific sourced content we can assess its suitability. ...we can assess... now would that be the royal we or you claim to speak for other fellows? we refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. all the same i dont get why you in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. itll take a lot of human resources to put these sections together... and if the consensus is already fixed in advance whats the point? perhaps its a little presumptuous but its realistic. its usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.as for your proposals previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a circumcision fetish searching google scholar for gilgal society indicates that there are no reliable secondary sources regarding that subject either. so i would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. our policies?... you mean the gilgal fellows? im not certain who youre representing here. wikipedias policies obviously. another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. in trying to improve the circumcision article its important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. thats not a personal attack nor a lack of presumption of good will. its merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article and a healthy cynicism about some readers intransigence. one reader has left a very rude domineering comment on my user page. if personal attacks like that are the norm i can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page. ==,0

8385,heaven of god to understand heaven then god must be understood . god is the all powerful supreme being of the universe. . universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen and defined as everything known and unknown. any concept of a multiuniverse shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces but only one universe. a mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. the subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. the subspace that includes all dimensions is the universe itself. the universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions. . god is either above the universe as the creator or part of some subspace of the universe or both above and part of the universe. the fourth condition that god is not part of the universe and god is not above the universe negates gods existence therefore the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of god. . god is supreme over the universe. it is gods creation and obeys gods rules. each rule can be obvious or nonobvious and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known. . god has the ability to create and destroy energy. without such a thing then the universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist there can still be god as a supreme being of the universe in such a condition but gods energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy. . god is smart is intelligent is wise has knowledge is a creator is good is benevolent has mercy and has understanding. god has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the universe. . god expects gods creation to do well since as a creator then the universe was created for gods purpose and enjoyment therefore life elements of gods creation such as people are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom understanding and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good. . because god is supreme then heaven and its rules of existence are defined by god. . god not only deals with people of earth of our sol system of the milky way galaxy god is a supreme being that can interact with the entire universe in whole or god can interact with the universe in part therefore god truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life and this implies that god may be truly forgiving and god may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important. . it is always believed that god likes people so help from god can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.. god likes to be acknowledged from gods own creation so it is good to acknowledge god as the benevolent intelligent creator of the universe.. love god. love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society family nation benevolence and many good things of life. be who you are as a person and love god and god is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. god has created the universe and has the ability to define heaven in any way. each person can get a personal heaven or heaven may be a interaction for people or heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. heaven is always defined as a good place but a personal heaven can also be a personal hell tailored to your life attitude and existence where god could give us by observation an environment where the individual prospered. the personal heaven and hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species.god can define heaven in any way and heaven is defined as a good place but as a supreme being god can allow many things and maybe god might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm so the possibilities of heaven are expected to be many if not endless possibilities. god is benevolent in heaven and the possibilities are many. love god.,0

8392, theoretical justification for our tax system? i added this sentence to the lede...the two main theories of taxation are the benefit theory and the ability to pay theory....which ‎guest removed with the explanation that this entry doesnt contain the terms used in my sentence. theres a theoretical explanation for the worlds current tax system...either that or were all crazy. if youre saying that this entry doesnt at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly thats a problem. you dont solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification. in order to do that...you first have to review all the references that i added to the benefit principle entry. if youre not willing to make that effort...then please dont edit this entry. having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...heres my take. this paper...the pure theory of public expenditure...by paul samuelson has been cited over times. it provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system. samuelsons argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. thats it...thats our tax system in a nutshell. thats the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find. ,0

8403, the usa under the confederation may have had the same name as the modernday usa but it was not the modernday usa. the usa confederation and the usa union or also called nation are different entities. the argument can be made that while the usa confederacy was a firm league of friendship among a number of free and independent states the usa union was a separate political entity that although it replaced the usa league was something completely different. saying that the articles was the first constitution of the usa and then providing a link to the modernday united states is misleading. my point the article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.and the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the declaration of independence and the articles of confederation and perpetual union.perhaps i didnt express my convictions eloquently enough to be understood since the differences are not easy to distinguish. if im not clear in my explanation point to the unclear parts and ask me to reexplain.,0

8405,it doesnt seem to me that your wikipedia history is a particularly good one. you own wikipedia page shows evidence of potentially hundreds of agravated users. i think what you are trying to say is that in years you have never been caught outright and had your account banned. i would say given your behaviour here and your past history shown by your own personal page is that it is likely is that you have borderline trolled for a number of years. but that is just to say that your history contradicts what you say. ive been quite clear about this right at the start and ive let you know as soon as i felt you were crossing the line. at this stage i warned you and pointed you to wikepedia guideline on trolling. the specific policy you may be in breach of is vandalism.. i am alleging that your behaviour amounts to trolling. you are threatening in effect to vandalize my work. what you are trying to do is in effect bully me to change my work to fit your personal pov. that is plainly a breach of wikipedia policy and guidelines. if you think im somehow getting it wrong and your behaviour is perfectly innocent then by all means go to those sources you yourself suggest. if you come back with a clean bill of health then i am prepared to revise my view. if you get a reliable source to review your posts here and they give their expert view that i am wrong then im quite happy to remove the allegation.with respect to the citations i am the author and so if you are unhappy with the sources ive used and having brought it to my attention but failing to find agreement after having discussed the matter it is up to you to consult a reliable source who is prepared to support your position something ive suggested now a number of times. otherwise we will keep the article as it is. particularly as it has been alleged that you are trolling an allegation which it appears you do not dispute discussing a variety of possiblities does not actually address the allegation. particularly its important that you refrain from making any changes until the allegation has been cleared up. if you dont i intend to follow the wikipedia guidelines on how to deal with vandalism caused by trolls.,0

8426,relaunch this was to judge by appearances. as theoretical physicist robert grumbold puts it “it took two decades of it to reveal what the cantab editors were really up to but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. basically if each letter of a cantab article is plotted as a point in an ndimensional space then you find that the piece on the piece on benjamin zephaniah written in early actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψspace. and the city issue of summer is decades if not centuries ahead of its time. the uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist selfaggrandizement in the hallowed cantab tradition. “in fact” says grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a dimensional machine which timelocks a dimensional black hole. we can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. but where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? was it in the pasteup room cupboard? had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in /? is it true that at . am on may a packet of chocolate hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? and why did so few people go into the nearby indian restaurant and so many come out? who or what was the chief editor who subsequently disappeared in south america? did he come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? and why does supernatural sleuth mike dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago years after he’d left cambridge? what is his dark secret? had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? this is evidently one mystery too many even for him. unsigned but by user endoscope,0

8432,language and mindset of a popular s musicali have removed the language and mindset... section of the article. the whole section is very subjective depending entirely on your point of view and could be applied to plenty of films from that era. further none of the information there was cited. i am posting the section here in its entirety for reference. language and mindset of a popular s musicalsome parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of crosby’s character sings a love song to an elevenyearold girl his exwife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughters body while upbraiding her for having no compassion as most characters in the movie have already or soon will and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex separated from the moviegoing masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of or by necessity having to interact with the newport upper class. when tracy lord played by kelly awakens hungover on her wedding day she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing but comes to believe she “made love” with mike the reporter played by sinatra and discusses it at length with her exhusband dexter played by crosby. at the time of course making love was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. being a romantic comedy “high society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.there are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie as kittridge the upandcoming coal magnate and fiance to the current mine owner’s daughter is described as having worked his way up from being a miner and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class as is sinatras journalist character.,0

8439, vandalism on btheory of time it seems perhaps i have been going about this the wrong way so i will try to be helpful and explain why your last edit was vandalism.first off the description intro the quality of the intro had been greatly increased naming mctaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section hence there is no need for it. the description gave a better just of what bthoery of time is a whole. undoing this completely is therefore vandalism especially if you dony first talk about it in the talk page before editing.secondly you removed description you then deleted the description as in metaphysics changed the better updated version of the physics part then moved it in the origin section. there really is nothing i can say about this i have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?....thirdly you removed this section it is noted by dean zimmerman in presentism and the spacetime manifold that atheory is almost certainly a minority view among philosophers while btheory has achieved broad acceptance.it seems you perhaps have a personal agenda favouring atheory therefore editing in favour of it this is not allowed on wikipedia and it is vital to keep a neutral point of view. the above statement however is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.finally and on the most relevant side you craig information it is an improvement that you have put the craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.however a lot of it is not quoted rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. such as...the btheory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory namely that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. the buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality but this is not the case with temporal becoming. you stated this outright. this is an opinion of craigs it should be demonstrated as such i also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. in fact you have stated all of craigs opinions as fact.if you want to make edits please first discuss them in the talk page and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not and how it should be worded.docheuh ,0

8452,upittit block hi orangemikehope you are doing well and i appreciate your work here on wikipedia. i have some questions regarding the block of upittit. although i too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editors responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns as hammersoft had pointed out and editors lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. this could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editors user space but the repeated violations are disconcerting. in fact i cant be entirely sure that the user account is only one person a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy. however it is my understanding that editors are not in wpcoi solely due to their place of employment or username but rather because of the issues of pov reliability and neutrality of their contributions. however in this case my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox the now deleted issues this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work as far as i know had been confined his/hers user sandbox. the editor was an obvious newbie and had twice sought feedback see here and here and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links downsizing of the article rewriting so it was not in violation of wpnotdir and the addition of outside neutral thirdparty references. in fact although i did not see any of the editors additions to this particular article since july th in my opinion it contained useful information was notable and was ready to be moved from the user space into wikipedia proper. mostly i would request that this page be restored as i would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the offline references from various library science journals that had been inserted. i guess you could say that i primarily lament the loss of this particular article. i would appreciate your thoughts on this issue and your review of the dscribe digital publishing article circa the july th version as i would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that sans the copyright violations that hammersoft elucidated. thank you.,0

8460,millions were killed on their way to the west is an example of german homemade history. the total number of german victims wasnt millions and many of the victims died of infections. the german government was responsible for the too late and poorly organised evacuation flucht. the germans created many myths about the expulsion. now a german demands academic treatment. yes yes yes but the academic treatment has been done. there are thousands of pages of published documents. instead of this it has become a platform where everybody seems to be allowed to post his own history regardless how wrong and unsystematic it may ever be. exactly and you are one of the ill informed and emotional posters. restored the deleted contri ackoz ,0

8462,thank you for the discussion. i may have worded it wrong. even though officially latin is not used in the citystate in the same way as the holy see leaving only the italian translation can also mislead readers to believe italian english etc are only used there even in documents and the average reader will still tend to confuse the two entities of the vatican city state and holy see together even after reading the article even i do. i believe the note therefore kills two birds with one stone with the clarification in a concise manner and instead of removing it any help in clarity would be appreciated and help the article overall.,0

8467,reply many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants fabric relaxers fabric conditioners. aiui too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers please confirm. the cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures eg celsius. however it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.there does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.again some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers. i would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.some distributors will suggest the use of bleach eg m and its scotchbrite microfiber kitchen cloths and others will specify rather high temperatures. perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but i am not sure how it could have been achieved.,0

8480,peer reviewas others have mentioned above the tone doesnt seem to be encyclopedialike its more of an educational piece on what happened from your view. in the opening section you write this operation was the result of wary parents under the newly instated castro regime who did not want to give up their parental rights to the cuban government. largely unpublicized for fear of being viewed as political propaganda this underground operation eventually became the largest recorded exodus of unaccompanied youth in the western hemisphere. that is a very hard claim to substantiate without any sort of reference. the whole demographics of minors section could either be put in another section or completely deleted because earlier you already state the children were cuban and their parents didnt agree with castro so it is in my belief their religions and social status dont matter enough for its own section. eo,0

8488, pope francis article quote from jerusalem post editorial hi herzen wanted to make sure you saw that i reverted an edit you made on the pope francis article asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. i did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial not an article in the jerusalem post. sorry for my mistake guess it was my sloppy thinking just categorizing editorials and news articles as different types of articles. however i think its a really wonderful quote only positive. the jerusalem post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the jewish community those who live in israel. if we talk about relations between this pope and the jewish community i think its great to have a quote from a paper like that basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the jewish community perhaps richer than any previous pope. anyway i think its a very good quote in a section that addresses the popes prior relationship with the jewish community. i hope youll reconsider your objection. in the meantime i have asked for the opinion of other editors. hope we can all agree best wishes and thanks for all your good work on this article. ,0

8500, zora and aiden you being nonmuslims assume being allknowing about islam and consider me as an ignorant muslims who misinterprets his religion. thanks really for your kind attitude. i was talking at an scholarly level quoting verses from quran you can not revert my edits wholesale just because you dont like them and post your own interpretation there. i dont like to get into a revert war though i am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and i will be the one who will eventually win the debate. you can always add the pov tag to the section and try to find the opinion of other scholars or quote other quranic verses. regarding your point doing original research i would like to say that it is just an excuse and maybe a good strategy to quite the beginners. if we really dont want to do any original research many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted. all the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together. you statement that i am doing original research is by itself an original research it is strange to me that somebody claims that his/her understanding of islam is authentic and the others are just original researchs. ,0

8506, pov tag vandalism? david starr has reposted the pov alert tag on this page. i do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. he is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page both in the bio. this does not a biased page make.i have clearly refuted both of these claims at length with no response despite repeated requests from starr. the garbage passage is balanced with an explanation from a da spokesperson. the source is quoted phrase is neutral and source scholar georg feuerstein is not in dispute by starr. the mention is crucial because it explains the controversial aspect in first line of lead and period is alluded to in adidam apologies for controversial earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits news articles and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in da page. also further explained by da himself in crazy wisdom section in teaching. mention of breakdown/divine emergence. this is a significant event as attested by adi da press. source is not biased all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. balanced with adi da selfassessment as personally significant event about which an entire book was written.undue weight was shown to be unreasonable as each line is short without subjective exposition. on balance throughout page all potentially controversial material in every case sourced cited and neutrally phrased is far outweighed by neutral info and da selfassessment. every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source and balanced with an alternate explanation. in every case. source disputes gurdjieff journal no specific instances of bias are alleged by starr from this source. starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from da rudi and siddha yoga accounts. no bias is reflected in wp entry no has any been revealed. and starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or selfpublished simply making assertion that it is a competing religious organization which is simply unproven there is no gurdjieff church or organization. lake county news source has been used for other articles starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike the divine emergence passage. he has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months as demonstrated by its repeated use. starr cannot singly enter now and discount source when not showing wp guideline that effectively discounts it only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the contact page on their website.all other editors including myself have been involved in give an take on this page making allowances and corrections for each other even yesterday i made changes to accommodate other editors including starr. i do not feel that starr is meeting this standard and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. because of this i am removing the pov tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. i have requested third party review and perhaps further dispute resolution. ,0

8509,i could have been reminded too but was banned and then threatened by you in response. the policy here is often to ban first and ask questions later. i think i am just about done with wiki. it is a laughing stock of an encyclopedia lampooned daily in the press and print world. the onion daily show colbert report have all picked on it for just the kind of thing i encountered daily as an editor here. it seems that censorship is the core issue behind almost all of what afflicts the site yet when it is called out by a fellow contributor it gets some phony we are all friends being neutral rhetoric lobbed back and no progress is ever made. you say you are following the rules even if you are there are higher rules like truth which should trump the petty stuff but that whole just following orders excuse is so typically self defeating it embarrasses me to say i am human. at what point does a person ask the tougher question like what is the truth and hold that question to a standard that trumps all other things? example that is why men get hanged when a judge decides dna evidence wont be used. no one is interested in truth they would rather hang an innocent than seek or pursue the truth. does it matter that the dna evidence came in on a thursday at pm after the evidence cutoff time for that judges jurisdiction or does it matter more that the evidence shows clear innocence? you would be the guy saying revert rule clearly states no evidence therefore all that follows is inadmissable. you are that guy who gasses jews and says the rules as you interpeted them suggested that was within the guidelines laid out by the almight founder of wiki and you are the guy strip searching year old women on airlplanes in search of bombs because the rules clearly state search everyone. no common sense is left in the entire world but we in the us are committed to our stupidity moreso than most.what ever happened to good ole common sense. go back and read through what was posted in the exchanges and try to fix the article. offer something constructive to the world and stop haggling over the small stuff. you make no mention of the substance of the article just enlightening me about the rules. thanks ,0

8550,gilles tréhini have listed this article at wpdrv for possible undeletion based on information i have received regarding a book that has been written by trehin about his fictional city urville. interested parties should contribute to the discussion. is this still deserving of featured article status?im beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles. it seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article. this should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia. instead it reads as if asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it. the very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling as a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling. i really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks. im not looking for an argument. im simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is i will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.,0

8648,edit conflict. i am very exasperated by the rant above. i have really tried to respond to all of your points jugi but i dont think you will be satisfied by any reply other than complete agreement. i am sorry if i accused you of anything you have not done i apologize. lets go back to your sentence about the accuracy of memris translations. i asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you. ok here they are ^ a b mayor of london press release ^ a b c d yigal carmon osama bin laden tape threatens u.s. states november ^ a b ramona smith did osama send election threat? philadelphia daily news november .carmon whitaker email debate. ok lets discuss these refs livingston press release is unacceptable as a rs on this. livingston does not have any translation expertise in arabic. he is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation. you are using carmons own translation to say that memris translations are inaccurate? that is quite bizarre. ramona smithi dont know what more i can sy about this. she is talking about the binladen tape. i believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is cole. aljazeera the most prominent arabic news source iin the world translated the same way memri did. juan cole disputed the translation after the fact saying that binladen was not using standard arabic and also disputed their interpretation. no one in the world excpet for binladen knows what he meant to say in that tape. this is not enough of an example to generalize from. could you consider reproducing the part of the whitaker piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion? i have read those articles a fewtimes and believe that whitaker came up with one minor example. i also note that you keep inserting a cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article. finally you want to use headings selectivity and bias and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits. i split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings. you object to this and say your version is more well written. i disagree. im not sure what more to say about this. elizmr it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a rant. and it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things i have not done as you apologized for above nor to falsely accuse me of not doing things that i have done as you just did above. i did provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago but you never responded see here. i even made the links easy to use simply click on them in the text i added.elizmr lets discuss them in the order you cited. the first is a mayor of london press release published by the greater london authority city hall and available on the website. do you claim that this is not a rs? your objection that the mayor of london livingstone is not personally a certified translator is absurd this press release is available from the city hall in arabic and other languages so clearly he did not prepare this document personally but with the help of a staff that spoke arabic. would you try to deny a statement by george bush about iran in a wp article because he is not personally trained to translate persian? your argument is just plain silly.i am using carmons statement to prove to you that the cole dispute was about translation since you were questioning that above. memris president makes this statement the u.s. media in general mistranslated the words. so clearly he considered this dispute to be about translation.ramona smith published her article about the cole dispute in the philadelphia inquirer. do you claim that this newspaper is not a rs? in her article she writes that supposed warning to red states was lost in muddled american translations released with the video last week the middle east media research institute claimed. but translation problems or no experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that bin laden was preparing to sort out safe states from target states. do you see why this is clearly a dispute about memri translation in a rs?whitaker and carmon debated in a special report in the guardian u,0

8672,κεκρωψ somehow you missed these objective criteria that are recommended to be used is it the official current name of the subject? check if the name is used in a legal context e.g. a constitution yep its in the constitution. is it the name used by the subject to describe itself or themselves? check if it is a selfidentifying term yep its selfidentifying term. and let me quote something else from that policy subjective criteria such as moral rights to a name should not be used to determine usage. these include does the subject have a moral right to use the name? does the subject have a legal right to use the name? does the name infringe on someone elses legal or moral rights? is the use of the name politically unacceptable?this pretty much invalidates most of arguments used by the greek side. what remains that fyrom is more popular than republic of macedonia? that has not been concludently proved and might not be even important since. . its not established that fyrom is used widely in english . we have a selfidentifying term that doesnt need disambiguation so where is the problem to use republic of macedonia? ,0

8755,given that many historians critics and many jewish and christian scholars believe that the book of daniel is about the events in israel from the beginning of the babylonian captivity to the end of the maccabean revolt they would say that the old testament reference is to antiochus iv epiphanes the man who attacked the temple in jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar erecting a statue of zeus as himself in the temple raiding the temple treasury and minting coins saying theos epiphanes god manifest etc.,0
8756,the coverage of this word is not sufficient in my opinion. the use of insert has a wider range of use that just in film than is conveyed here. i therefor hope that som additions to the explanation of insert would be added to the escyclopedia in the future.. like the relationship between addition and insert in the general sense. what the word insert realy means and where it is derived from if so. as a person using english as a second language i use wikipedia extensively to to fully understand the things i read. i therefor thing that explanations of words should be as rich as possible so there will be no doupt to where and how a word should be used.,0

8764,to overcome these limitations some fungi such as armillaria form rhizomorphs or mycelial cords it was not until i searched rhizomorphs that it became clear that the term is synonymous with mycelial cords. i suggest either making it clearer that they are the same or simply dropping one and keeping whichever is more prominently used in the literature.characteristics shared with plants include a similar pathway in the biosynthesis of large organic molecules with important roles in cellular development and for defense called terpenes. after rereading this sentence multiple times it isnt clear if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of large organic molecules and cellular development / defense or if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of organic molecules which are themselves related to cellular development / defense. the latter interpretation seems more logical but if that is the case why does this introductory sentence on terpenes complicate itself by introducing seemingly unnecessary information on organic molecules?however the biochemical pathways for the synthesis of similar or even identical compounds often differ markedly between fungi and plants which is shown by studies that have demonstrated that the fungal and plant enzymes for making these compounds differ strongly in their sequence and other characteristics indicating that they have evolved separately in fungi and plants. this is a very long sentence. consider slicing it into smaller sentences for better readability.more than species display the phenomenon of bioluminescence of mycelia or fruiting bodies. this seems like a bit of a non sequitor for this paragraph. perhaps it would be better placed in the diversity section?,0

8803,if someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken. it is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered and to give the editor a chance to stop. in fact a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first. i do think that more friendly wording might have been used rather than i will report you to wikipedia admins and have you blocked but i have seen far more uncivil warnings than that. the ip editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article and since you say that you are done with the article it may be that he/she will leave it at that. if the ip editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article then please come back and tell me as that may well be harassment and action may well be needed but if what has happened so far is the end of it then i dont see any reason for not just letting it drop. ,0

8821, == issue on images still unresolved == i appreciate your inputs in image talk and i agree once in a while i might sound rude purely unintentional since i put facts blantly. but slimvirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.slim is not a he. given that she named herself after a javanese princess perhaps you could take the hint and note that shes a woman. also i dont think you were simply blunt. i think you were rude to slim. i recognise its a fine line but given that ive mentioned it to you perhaps youll take more care to stay on the right side of it?she has suggested in an email to me that she is in talks with another editor. now i dont know who this other editor and i certainly dont like this secrecy. instead of having a discussion on this she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. she couldve atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. i think that would be reasonable. i have a high regard for slim and i dont think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.inso far as the images are concerned i had stated to her a couple of images on one issue animal rights is ok but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by peta and its assocites.so you have a dispute. you need to recognise that you are not necessarily right you disagree about how many images are necessary. i feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.this should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.the buav is not a controversial organisation. it is a highly respected body whose voice is listened to in all circles of british society. a viewpoint doesnt become controversial just because you dont share it.wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.i dont see how it is any fairer to use one two or ten images in this instance. while i agree that slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images i simply dont feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use thats true but its only one factor and obviously each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.as far as the other images some are on personalities she claims have agreed to use their photos here. unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe.first of all you can believe slim because you assume good faith. perhaps youre not aware of that policy. yes you can ask slim to provide evidence of that but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you wont believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.once i pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.yes okay. trust her and ask for proof.both of us are editing in good faith but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other me relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.id urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. yes slim does have powerful friends who will back her regardless but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then im afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information.i think thats a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules which exist for good reason and shouldnt be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. however she is not a copyviolater trying to destroy wikipedia. partly i think she simply didnt understand your problem and that was in part a failure of your communication and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesnt handle disagreement well. so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? i know,0
8822,mixednocs doesnt represent any subtotal contrary to eu gdp in your example it is rather arbitrary mix of athletes from different countries.the current medal table serves the sole purpose of noc comparison and mixednocs introduces some confusion into this comparison. look it is definitely listed for comparison here taking its place according to its medal count even without rank assigned. why not to show another medal table to the right of the current medal table? and this second table would contain medals of different nocs won by athletes within mixednoc teams. mixednoc competitions shouldnt be considered somewhat less relevant so this table is also a relevant one. it is separated just because theres no valid reason to combine them together within noc medal table since it would compromise the purpose of noc comparison.,0

8848,restoring to the original version.==the article has been restored to its original bclass version before the edits by by. the pib article on which by made the edit is incorrect that report was submitted by the army. from the article the standing comitteed to which the report was submitted says there were clear factual inaccuracies in the armys deposition before the standing committee. the most glaring of them is the armys suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the arjuns performance.in fact the army has already accepted the arjun for introduction into service based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. after firing trials in summer the trial report written by the army said the accuracy and consistency of the arjun has been proved beyond doubt.the ongoing trials in pokhran that the army is citing are accelerated usage cum reliability trials aucrt. in these two arjun tanks were run almost nonstop for kilometres not to judge performance but to evaluate the tanks requirement of spare parts fuel and lubricants during its entire service life. i would like by to prove that indeed the problems mentioned in the article is that mentioned in the pib article from latest sources after the parliamentary committee agreeing about the pib report being wrong.also i request admins not to revert back. until by proves the above requested things his edit will become unverifiable and based on the pib report which is incorrect. thank you all. ==,0

8857,as much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the rohingya and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live. there is already a lot of articles on the arakanese people and state that have no concern of the rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect this is pushing the line a bit far. rohingyas should be treated fairly i do not contest that. but articles like this one are pure selfpitying and clutters wikipedia with absolutely useless information. i wonder when will somebody change the name of the article on burma/myanmar on wiki to country where the rohingya are persecuted.rather a brief mention of where the rohingyas reside should be placed if desired on the main article on rakhine state albeit short and concise not dump an entire list of names copied directly from some publication.with all due respect this article should be deleted.,0

8862, to boris tsirelson you stated no one is entitled to remove or edit others comments. yet that has been repeatedly done to my comments. you are applying a double standard. either no one is allowed to edit or everyone is allowed to edit as per wikipedia the free encyclopedia. prejudice to which editors are allowed to edit and which ones are not is a violation of free speech in the united states and a contradiction to a free encyclopedia.nature is not a feeling or a theory. either it is superdeterministic or it is not hence absolute. philosophy has nothing to do with the laws that govern our existence. please feel free to conduct the thought experiment to prove nature wrong and the crankery bunch opinions are valid. if you understood what the meaning of absolute meant you would have also understood that opinions in contradiction to natures laws will always be invalid. ,0

8879,youre certainly correct that the kerry article isnt a direct parallel to this one. the kerry article reports on flatout lies that were told about kerry. in many countries he would have been able to win a defamation lawsuit about the statements quoted in our article. american law provides a high degree of protection to people who make false statements about elected officials. thus our article gives greater currency to lies about kerry. by contrast no one has pointed to any lies about rick santorum that would be squelched or even given less currency by the deletion/merger/renaming/whatevering of this article. compared to the swiftboating of john kerry the use of santorums name in a nondefamatory way is minor. as for streisand if some limbaugh nastiness about her gets the level of attention thats been given to frothy mix start the appropriate article. when the deletionists come howling for your head or at least for deletion please drop me a note on my talk page so i can prove my integrity by opposing deletion.  t c ,0

8919,mark i am sorry for your desperation ill refrain from skepticism but it is both misguided and misplaced. the issue is far wider than a dialog with promoldovan interests. it is a a dialog with russoskeptic interests—and since mauco has branded me a partisan ill identify that as my partisanship. i do not see this as an ethnic struggle for selfdetermination of ukranians and russians from moldovans. i see it as a naked russian power play and not the only such one currently to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against nato expansion. regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets no impartial observer—and certainly no russoskeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as minimally the authorities from the top to the bottom are replaced with transnistrian natives not populated by russian citizens including omon thugs who transplanted to transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the baltics by violent and deadly means failed and russia and ukranian forces completely vacate the transnistrian territory that is all arms all troops and raze all arms depots to the ground.when that happens and people then dance in the streets then i will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.   you keep talking about the parliaments opposition to smirnov. as a russoskeptic i will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some elections which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. we can seriously discuss the will of the peopleafter every russian in the pmr authorities is out as in out and out of the countryafter the foreign troops are all out as in out of the country and their arms depots demolishedand i dont mean russian military retiring to become citizens of the pmr eitherafter it is legal for a political party to be promoldovan that currently being treason andafter romanian is once again taught in its proper latin script not in some cyrillic sovietera utter bastardization created purely to support the stalinist fiction that moldovans are not romanians.then we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation. i have the patience to wait for that discussion do you?   if the russoskeptics disagree with anything ive represented please feel free to correct. — ,0

8933,firstly i am not fixated on nor am i carrying on a dispute with epeefleche and i certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. if you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be what its worth my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. i first posted a message on epeefleches talk page explaining the minor changes i had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. i also explained the obvious issue i had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list before posting on the article talk page. i do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way and thought i had responded in a reasonable manner to all epeefleches comments while trying to return the focus onto the article. i repeat i do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. i cannot be any clearer on that.i have acknowledged that i should not have engaged in repeated reverting and i see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this my response to greg l was over the top and i should have done as i usually do – dont click the save page button and just ignore it but its too late now. bigissue ,0

8945, edit summary when editing an article on wikipedia there is a small field labelled edit summary under the main editbox. it looks like thisthe text written here will appear on the recent changes page in the page revision history on the diff page and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. see mhelpedit summary for full information on this feature.when you leave the edit summary blank some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted so please always briefly summarize your edits especially when you are making subtle but important changes like changing dates or numbers. thank you. i do when im doing anything more than grammar. the only exception to this would be on clan fraser of lovat of which im the only editor at present and i didnt think to add edit summaries. otherwise i believe that i have done so. if you have any particular situations in which i have failed to do so id be happy to explain myself id much appreciate it. see it for yourself green bars are for edit summaries red bars are for edits with no summaries. thats quite a nifty tool there. im fully aware of edit summaries. i dont provide edit summaries on my own talk page or my user page. i also dont usually provide them on other users talk pages. in earlier editing i didnt take the summary seriously if youre referring to anything from several months ago or more i do apologize. like i said if you have any particular situations where you believe i missed one please bring them up to me. i would sincerely like to know. otherwise i dont see what youre trying to accomplish here. i think the link speaks for itself. as for what im trying to accomplish i think my original comment explained just that. if you were trying to just helpfully remind me i thank you though i dont think it was needed. i saw the page it didnt say anything to me except that i finally know my edit count. if you really want to get a point across to me i suggest you do so blatantly. if your original comment explained your motives then we are done here. your nonsense page if you are interested in archiving your old talk you may want to review wikipediahow to archive a talk page. accusing other editors of defacing your talk page for politely reminding you of wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part and will only make you look bad. i suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like user talkcanaen/archive. furthermore making negative comments about discussion by other editors and claiming that their edits are not worth reading shows that you arent interested in abiding by wpnpa wpciv nor wpeq. if you want to improve your working relationship with other editors it might help to avoid incivility. im not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet but thank you for the suggestion. i use nonsense in a lot of ways other people do not because i find a lot of other words to be boring at present. likewise instead of cool or awesome or thats interesting im currently in the habit of referring to things as nifty. its something i do. i know how to archive a talk page ive done it before. i still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack because ive grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. im not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. i thought that this was resolved by now. i have quite decent relationships with other working editors it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. it is regretful but something which seems to be. if someone takes offence to my creation of a nonsense page they can bring it up to me personally as you,0

8960,i disagree. nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it’s used in support of a discussion about causal theories which in this case it would be.i recommend that people take a look at how this issue is handled by other similar wikipedia articles particularly race and intelligence which has been at least as hotly contested as this one. although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this iq difference the iq difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart. this image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.the original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the doj website and i think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also. the only question that needs to be considered is whether the data represented in the image is relevant to the article which in this case it clearly is.,0

8962,no worries here against readding it—i understand where youre coming from. i suppose its moreorless common sense to me that its impossible to give someone a warning to stop vandalism if they are not active now with vandalism. to give somebody a warning for example to stop eating makes little sense if they are not currently eating. thus the socalled warning is not actually a warning at all because there is no logic to hold it together. just now however i realize that this is probably quite beyond common sense so i would have no issue if you readd that bit. · talk ,0

9020, utccommentsthis is the first article i nominate to gareview please tell me if i miss anything. walk victor falk talk what about those taken prisoner by the british/allies in the middle east. also those who refused to join the free french in britain and were repatriated back to france.? i respect this point but were talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in germany. thats what the scholarship covers and its that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. everything else a tiny fraction by comparison is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. yes french soldiers were probably taken prisoner from indochina to britain north africa to the middle east. but they pale into insignificance when compared with the million in germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about french prisoners but only deal with the germanheld ones. so i see your point but i cant really do anything about it. it just isnt out there. yesterday i was editing freefrancesyriaandeastafrica and as it mentioned how only out of chose to join free france while the rest wanted to be rapatriated my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like french wwii powsvichy prisoners to target in this article. however as notes some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances such as beeing spies obvious traitors collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a pow by international conventions for the allies rank and file vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation no questions asked and their incarceration as pows always a temporary affair. i can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as axis and especially japanese ones after the coup in march eliminated any fiction of vichy rule in indochina but sources about that might be very elusive to find and anyway probably more within the scope of the pows held by the japanese wikipedia article. at the most a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere to dispell the same curiosity from readers that youve shown. walk victor falk talk reviewer seems to be active on wikipedia but has not done anything to this review in almost weeks. if no progress is made within the next days hours i will close the review. talk im here will be for the rest of the week at least. walk victor falk talk just for future use when you add a ping without any text it will not go through. the template is a little picky as you need to add the ping and some sort of text after it all in one edit for it to work. talk still no start on the review ? june,0

9029, unprotected im going to edit based on my comments in talknewantisemitismsourcingclaimsfor.countryspecificincidents so could we discuss them now? all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new antisemitism i.e. coming from the left related to radical antizionism etc. talk they may well be but they are not sourced that way. i dont think we can expect the words new antisemitism to appear in every single report we reference. weve defined it and weve linked to many sources who are defining it. the definition isit is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left. it is characterized by the demonization of the worlds only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion. israels right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. the jewish peoples right of selfdetermination is denied. double standards are applied whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state. symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism are used for example blood libels are resurrected the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world or being in control of other governments or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. arab and islamic antisemitism are excused and ignored. strawman attacks are made whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is antisemitism and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable and to deny that there is any such thing as the new antisemitism. all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools particularly in europe. it is found in conjunction with antiamericanism because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government antizionism and the antiglobalization movement.all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components so when we find them we can offer them as examples so long as someone has discussed them in terms of antisemitism or attacks on jews. talk my worry is that livingstone has not been at least in the sources provided accused of antisemitism and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of antisemitism against his supporters. add to that that we appear to be accusing them of antisemitism not reporting others allegations which is or and unwise in the case of galloway. the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new antisemitism so id just want to tidy that up. livingstone has very definitely been accused of antisemitism got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it as has galloway and without question his supporters. the section talks about it in relation to that election. by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit and we can talk later if there are any disagreements. talk slim whose definition is this? all the sources put together. the above are the issues they agree on. it was posted weeks ago. talk i think you mean all the sources from one side of the argument put together. its been a while since we discussed this so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative? sorry youll have to look in the archives theyre either there or in the article. by all the sources i mean all the sources who study new antisemitism. the above are the elements they appear to agree on. talk im asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative. please respond. userc,0

9047, italics for wordsaswords in plant articles like pumpkin it is normal to use quotation marks rather than italics as per moswordsaswords when italics could cause confusion quotation marks instead may be used to distinguish words as words. this is because italics mark scientific names. i dont think the change you made at pumpkin matters but elsewhere it might create confusion for readers not familiar with the scientific names involved. as an example citrus is used both as a common name and as the genus name cistrus. it would be confusing to use italics to mark citrus as reference rather than a use. ,0

9049, mormonism and history merge proposal storm i saw your note on trodels page and wanted to touch base. i am definately against merging primarily because placing the topic in history of the latter day saint movement reduces it to a one time issue. the most recent pattern of faithpromoting history was as a byu trained historian i sincerely hope a one time event. but mormonism and history is a much bigger topic closer to historiography having implications from josephs time to the present. i dont know if this is the right title for such an article but we are having a restructuring discussion on the mormonism and history page. please drop in and give your two cents. and besides there is certainly little room for more material in history of the latter day saint movement best wishes as always. ,0

9092,==name==ive been studying satmar for a good bit and ive been to kiryas joel. ive never heard it called sakmer. are we sure about this? ive been around many hasidim for a long long time too and i have never heard of sakmer either so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed. there is a street in kj called sakmeralso look at this the reason some call it sakmer is because the name satmer is based on satu mare which remotely referes saint mary note not true satu mare means simply large village in romanian. hassidic jews have always refrained from sanctifying christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. izak love when you dont know something that does not make it balony. ps i havent been studying satmer i am one and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as sakmer aka satu mare. pps there is no kj street called sakmer. the photo you attached clearly dubbs the satmar rabbi the rav of sakmer. for those who study satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the satmers use the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this סאקמער. the third letter from the right carries the k sound. cheers.i recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor greatgrandfather? of his called satmar sakmer. why do they not utilize that term anymore? and im done with my hardcore pshat study of different hasidic groups. its total nonsense the saint mary story. satu mare means large town. my father has been there many times. wikipedia yes yes also says that satu mare means large town and that saint mary is something else entirely in hungarian/romanian. i revised the opening paragraph by indicating the satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups it is widely thought there are about lubavitchers but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role this is all conjecture it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest there is no way of knowing. about satmar and neturei karta. the cherem bit is incorrect as is the bit of a denunciation. also the part of asking reb yoilish to meet with yasser arrafat. its all myth. yasser arafat and the plo were not the public face of the palestinian cause before reb yoilish had his stroke so it doesnt make sense. i actually asked a chaver of the satmar beis din about the cherem and he said its nonsense. the beis din has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the united states. no denunciation was issued either. its a made up propaganda piece by the kakhnik radio station arutz sheva. it never happened. no such thing ever appeared in der yid which is the official newspaper. good editgood recent edit izak. ¸ø¤º°`°º¤ø¸¸ø¤º°`°º¤ø¸ july utc etymology with satu coming from the same root as city civitasactually its not like this. in romanian satu is derived from latin fossatum and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat in latin fossa. cetate is the romanian word derived from civitas. talk npovpeople have mistaken this article to be a fork of it is not. and due to its encylopaedic nature please do not appeal to users to refrain from making a chilul hashem because frankly nobody gives a shite. the purpose of this site is informative not satmers or judaisms pr page nor is it a private opinion venting station. if you are a member of this site and its npov policy is not in accordance with your religious beliefs you are kindly requested to hold your peace. state the true unfiltered truth but only that please. aaronzalman conflictapparently someone has made this subsection its own page again. thoughts anyone? is it enough of an issue to have it be its own page separate from satmar the dynasty? you bet this issue s,0

9123,guys sorry for any trouble i caused. i just started using my wikipedia account recently. when i read about the secret mailing list fiasco i wanted to know the truth so not knowing that it was decided for whatever reason to stop pestering durova with questions i asked a simple question which i did not intend to be a personal attack. sorry if it was taken that way.p.s. i remember someone i believe it was neil citing my message on an anons talk page against me because of my comment im looking into your identity.. theres a misunderstanding here. i used to write for a school newspaper and i was doing research on a school computer not logged in. i found that the ip of the computer i was using had done some bad edits in the past. i decided to write an article about it and also attempt to find who was vandalizing the pages since it was someone at my school i never meant it as a stalkertype thing. sorry if it was taken that way... ,0

9126,hi. re ɰ /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as . this sound is not phonetically w because it does not have lip rounding so some folks including me feel that <ɰ> is a more appropriate symbol. was useful because it was found on typewriters while <ɰ> had to be written in by hand. computers are getting better at displaying this stuff so i say use the more accurate symbol. ç is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. ç is an allophone of /h/ but ɰ is not. actually ɰ is redundant since it is just a short ɯ like j is a short i and w is a short u — we could just use a nonsyllabic diacritic. re j j is supposed to mean /j/. it doesnt include /ɰ/ — c+/ɰ/+v is not allowed. in other words japanese allows an optional /j/ before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset i.e. v or /j/+v or c+v or c+/j/+v. feb utc,0

9129, background section at the present time the background section cites unspecified interviews with the media according to which ahmed claimed to take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.the sentence is taken verbatim from the npr article. however it links to a dallas news article which says no such thing to a dallas news interview which also does not contain this statement and mentions a wfaa interview which ive been unable to find. ive checked four different interviews with ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.if such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by npr it would be nice to have a direct link a quote and a date.the problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. when the story broke on / the device was consistently described by the media as a homemade clock or an invention. the fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a wfaa article which quoted irving police on / but otherwise mostly ignored. it only went viral so to speak when dawkins waded into the controversy on / and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.much of the immediate reaction from obamas tweet and zuckerbergs invitation to dawkins lashing out seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock. ,0

9139,youre mixing apples and oranges historical scholarship is not required for wikipedia to add information say on a claim to the bosnian throne. sorry no one has claimed the croatias yet. to add that information to the list of many other claimants around the world does not require approval from the pope but it does reqire that the claimant has a in fact made the claim and that b news sources reported on it that are considered respectable in that country. since the news source were talking about here are online alexa is the criterion for their as any other online ranking of news portals because their high position in alexa means high readership. in the news business this is how you measure success. the sources that reported on the claim are not tabloids but conventional news portals as anyone can see etc. please be respectful others have brains and eyes too and stop the edit war. thanks for the diagram. if you look at it closely youll realize youre not even attempting to compromise meaning youre the one not following wpeditconsensus. instead you keep making total reverts canceling entire edits which took hours of someones valuable time without ever discussing it in talk. by being so obviously rude you also remove dozens of reliable references such as in ban borić article where your remove all history ebooks from the google scanning project with a single hit of a button. never heard of a rule saying that google scanning project is bogus and banned from wikipedia. thats malicious editing plain and simple. please stop edit war. or to use your catholic vocabulary please stop the crusade.,0
9140,i didnt utter any threat to anybody and i have looked at this link of yours stop making a fool of yourself by ignoring the facts. you pretend as if it was a threat but it wasnt. it cover what is actually going on and i am in my rightd to inform a person of what his actions have result in. you do not have the right to supress this warning unless you contact me and/or give an explaination for your reason to suppress it. you failed to do any iof it.i idnt receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me yhought your message above is dated of the of august it wasnt there at that date and i am sure of it. i didnt have acces to anything that day.about the things i edit they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.all pseudo subbjects are all lies as the bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web inclusiv wiki at different times for the past years.for days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about and seeing that ybm used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they dint have answered the questions at hand and that way confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case as he has always done since .someone has to stand up and say it someone has to put an end to this circus and i choose to do so.i do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the bogdanov but through this affair that i begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.two things became clear for me as i scanned all the web on the subjects ybm was the person doing all the staging and ybm didnt knew what he was talking about. i also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him he will keep asking and accusing peoples and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.and of course especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic those people phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.so they left and never show up again leeving all free room that ybm could ever wish for to pursue his goal.but what was this goal exactly?it wasnt the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.he was repeating himself and soon i saw a pattern emerging from all his apparitions on the web with falsh accusations lies home made stories fantasyfull evidences links to web sites from his own making agression personal attacs insults.his goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. t>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.then i was contacted by people who had been confronted to him prior to this case and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.i stude it and saw worse than i could ever imagined. it was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.it is what they call post situationism and wich is issued of voyer. in the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer on cooking books he had just met voyer but been found of him for a longer time by the beginning of bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of voyer and co and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this confrerie.that is the reason why this article i come with is of such importance. it reveal what was behind all along what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.there is no bogdanov affair it is an illusion a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.brillant unless there was casualties.and there is.plenty of and more than the bogdanovs private sphere and their career.i was really aroused from the beginning when i realised what ybm was about but even more when i saw what it all was really about i was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of ybm not kn,0
9141,did christians invent satan.the idea that christians invented satan is lies propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job so why blame the christians rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent who had refused to worship adam also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan old testament samuel later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul satan by pharisees jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees. in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west. so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st. michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels revelation also reveals woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. christ was tempted by the shaitan times after his baptism in the desert. so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious. the devil had pride then disobedience then jealousy then slander then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar murderer and thief.why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions? why so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists. even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara who was a tempter. jesus even spoke to st. peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st. peter like wheat whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation. the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven who became too full of himself later whe god created man in his own image god requests all the angels to bow to adam all do except for one angel later called lucifer. he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay however god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job some mention that in isaiah o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil but i also consider it to babyloon as in revelation fallen fallen is babylon the great etc. revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. god has talks with the satan so satan can not be inferred thence to be a nonentity as god does not talk to nonentities. also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil others realise that this is negative nonsense. i know that people were possessed by demons fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming ha jesus you nazorean what hast thou to do with us hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible some truth is also in the quran.there are some truths to be found also in other religious books but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit. have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits. pagans invented their gods and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.jews and christians had the opposite god revealed to them the truth and the way and the life.thanksemail jameshernonthe next seion is not written by me james hernon,0

9176,what follows is a discussion with donaldrichardsands transferred from my user talk page dear donaldrichardsandsthe link for the revised article is here thanks for taking a look. from what you wrote above i understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. i would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. all best i think it would be more accurate to say the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. however and this is what will take the time the old version does have merits which should not be lost. there is an energy among some people to show that berezovsky is a mafialike boss. when i told a friend about berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how i would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article my friend expressed shock and dismay that i would risk my life so. the article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. this balance is what takes the time. i would enjoy helping. your energy for the article is obvious. if we could get an editor who wants to portray berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration the article could strengthen quickly. in the article i am working on presently one other editor is active and he is very critical. but he and i have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. similar cooperation could happen for the berezovsky article. rely on secondary sources. insist on a conservative scholarly examination of all aspect of berezovskys life. and yes i still want to email him ask him for a picture and perhaps go for coffee. dear donaldrichardsands thank you for your input. of course mr. berezovsky is a highly controversial person and i think all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. but he is a major figure who influenced russian political history over two decades and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake but for the sake of the whole russia block on wikipedia. with respect the belief of some people that berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion which is not supported by facts. if an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous it has no place on wikipedia regardless of how many people may hold it. otherwise we should change the rules and make wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. under current rules we should work with well sourced facts. the facts in this matter are as follows. that particular opinion has originated from a single source mr. klebnikov whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. the publication forbes which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. dozens of profiles of mr. berezovsky in major world newspapers which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism including serious russian sources do not repeat these allegations. i believe that wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. the revised article states the sourced facts as they are there was an opinion voiced which was then discredited. of course if anyone can quote another reputable source which supports this opinion with evidence it should be mentioned. since i am going on vacation i have put the revised text on the main page and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version which can be accessed via history tag amend challenge and comment as long as it is done by the rules. the last thing i want is another edit war. on the other hand seeking consensus is just one of wikipedia rules. avoiding pushing opinions and removing unsourced slander is another. ,0

9179, youre full of helpful ideas takes notes — re no double redirects my mistake. thanks for correcting my suggestion. id assumed that the article would be at the more common name race condition and negligently failed to check my assumption — gitmo entryi recently attempted to edit the guantanamo bay entry due to excessive bias. the various authors have used the entry as an attempt to focus entirely on the united states prison camps instead of the bay itself or its geography culture or history. whats the deal with that? mar your edits as were blanking and thus had to be reverted. boycrashfan ,0
9180,it might sound plausible yet it doesnt explain the step of being expelled from wikipedia. this unrelated revert triggered the expulsion yet it doesnt have anything to do with an/i and i will prove it on your talk page. it was a hasty action to block someone just because he rightfully reverted the disruptive edits of one user who previously has partaken in multiple disputes over the same thing genres in the infobox. i find it quite ironic that no one seemed to notice that these exaggerated responses are clearlyobviouslynottobetakenseriously which some unrelated users reduced to vicious personal attacks/borderline threatening. this was used as an excuse to make the final step. also its quite shocking that an/i is treated like pub where everyone can influence others opinions. ,0

9182,more on guarnelloguarnello m/f. both a kind of linen or cotton textile and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... the guarnello rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. it is worn by children as a simple washable garment and possibly also by pregnant women. there are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing. dress in renaissance italy by jacqueline herald humanities press nj quoted herethe coarse overdress for working women definition is from the world of renaissance florence by francesco adorno translated by w. darwell giunti isbn .page this site saysa loose sheer overdress worn over a regular dress was used at home and after birth hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs botticellis three graces wears in his primavera but it can also be seen in his portrait of smeralda brandini in london.that may also be following herald which is listed as one of the sources.the fabric is also translated as fustian which would seem to be the coarser variety.and heres the kicker an article in the globe and mail quoted with the crucial next line here saysmona lisa had recently given birth to a baby a team of canadian and french scientists announced tuesday so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish the researchers found that leonardo da vincis model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time or mothers who had recently given birth. the filmy robe was called a guarnello. ,0

9186, re history merges the instructions are all laid out at wikipediahow to fix cutandpaste moves. as i found out quickly when you try to move an article from title a to title b and title b already exists the software will automatically delete the edits of title b for you when you move the article. try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in mediawiki. also its a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldnt be reverted. once i was history merging melbourne and a wellmeaning editor tried to move it back while i was working on the history merge which resulted in melbourne disappearing from wikipedia for a few minutes. maybe ill try the same thing at auckland one day . hope this helps some. ,0

9197,improvement needed while ive declined speedy deletion i see two major areas that require improvement in the article.notability while there are some assertions of significance such as winning seedcamp its not entirely clear how major that competition is. accordingly theres no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. imo theres enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion a however it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.reliable sourcing other than basekits website the only source provided is a review at download squad. it appears to be on par with engadget in terms of reliability. still to build a robust article and demonstrate general notability citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.my personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate but if its not improved over the next few weeks it is subject to being nominated for deletion. — talk,0
9198,sorry but no. the idea of a partial rather than site ban is that a user can probably be a productive contributor to the encyclopedia but needs to disengage from a particular area. using various usertalk pages as a proxy for talkclimatic research unit hacking incident would not serve that purpose. if a user approaches you with a specific limited question it is probably okay though less than ideal to render an answer including reference to this temporary ban users who repeatedly make such approaches after being informed of the ban might be engaged in baiting attempting to game the system or otherwise editing disruptively. thank you for seeking clarification. / cont.,0

9203,reviewing your sources.... msm in africa does not contain the string trans anywhere in the document. i dont know what you expect in that document being used as a reference except to increase your refcount. unaids states that tg is typically considered alongside. it is fairly equivocal about the whole matter. the powerpoint document gives the most convincing argument with the statement with regard to hiv surveillance and prevention the cdc’s current practice is not to separate mtf tg and ts people from the msm category with no attention paid to the risks of ftm tg people. a noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay. the mstgw article speaks against applying labels such as msm and categorizing people. this would include the msm label. that the article specifically refers to these individuals as mstgw and not msm is a good indicator that tg individuals would be nonmsm. lastly the hivreleated tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as balls. these social networks include houses i.e. a guild providing a social framework for young msm and transgender persons that exist in many large u.s. cities house leader personal communication . all four also were commercial sex workers. this is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.my conclusion... i have to admit ive been viewing tg too narrowly and excluding individuals that are tg yet also msm. however that doesnt mean that ts individuals are msm... its hard to argue that a drag queen isnt msm while it is hard to argue that a postoperative mtf living a life in stealth is an msm. please feel free to alter the document to reflect this information. ,0

9210, at the moment the substance of the article all appears to come from and neither of which is particularly notable. further its circular for the article to say john smith head of is famous. for proof check his bio on where it says that hes famous. that kind of thing runs afoul of autobiography guidelines. in order for someone to have a claim of being prominent they need to have other people refer to them that way. the wikipedia page needs to supply links to book magazine and newspaper articles which verify descriptions such as sugarbakers prominence or the podcast being popular. for more info check wikipediaverifiability. as it is there are so few references on the article its actually in danger of being nominated for deletion but general practice is to give a new article some time to breathe to see if additional references can be added. ,0

9215,mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. i do not know anything about this topic but looking at the criticism section of the current article it appears to all be reflective of specific timeperiods and therefore belongs in the history section. a dedicated criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. though you could also look at it the other way that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.as for the draft i see there are some nice plugs for moodys that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. well... i wrote the article on history of public relations and it mentions some pr agencies that played a role in its history so this is not unprecedented. however i am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. i think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention but i would suggest an editor do some light research independently trim copyedit and rewrite it and mix it with the current criticisms section into a more balanced history. talk,0

9235,in other words you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue on a different page euro in part by employment of your hamhanded authority to shut me down for a few days which you did months ago. no you were not successful. in part this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue they were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority they didnt find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know debate. you yourself were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate too. but that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input in any way into this matter. you must admit to these people that you really werent interested in the subject you were just brought in to be a thug a torpedo to shut down the debate. you must also admit that you were stalking me on wp tell them what mechanism you used so they know what you did. the fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.the reality is remember reality? that according to the remnants of their archived webpage euro did not argue for white supremacy white separatism white nationalism or any other ism i can imagine would be relevant. the problem is political correctness rears its ugly head yet again and persons who display lessthansufficient obeisance to the fascisticleft will be shut off shut down and maybe even shut away. if you want to legitimately do anything more find people other than your cronies willing to debate the issue. i raised my question months ago and so far nobody is disputing what i asked have said they have not appeared let alone have they contradicted it. you dont have some sort of automatic default win authority at least according to wp rules. i proceeded to edit and i have done so. ,0

9245,leave as dab page for now. the difficulty is that sources use the term very differently to refer to a vegan vegetarian or semivegetarian diet. there are several physicians and others selling particular plantbased diets that they say work miracles because of this or that ingredient omission or combination and very few medrscompliant sources offering definitions. there was even someone who tried to trademark the term plant strong. so i think this should remain a dab page until there are more medrs sources or it should be redirected to semivegetarianism or vegetarianism with a subsection in one of those articles. of those two options i think a dab page would be most helpful to readers. talk ,0

9248,this is what hes put up on the karl rove discussion page. ill be frank. the blocking of came a bit late for my taste. however he was found to be in violation of the revert rule and to again quote the policy which ironically malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of a bright line exists on edit warring known as the threerevert rule rr. if an administrator has not acted already by this point then action is very likely especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. policy forbids edit warring generally and editors may be blocked if they edit war with or without breaching rr. i commend for taking the actions he did. the subsequent complaints malke made and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later are a matter of record on his user talk page. malke has since deleted the notifications but they are viewable in his talk page history and make interesting reading.after malkes block on august i decided i needed to take a step back. for the past ten days i have busied myself with other wikipedia subjects. i now return to this page. i suggest we talk a bit about what happened and i also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month edit by edit. it continues to seem clear to me that malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda his obsession got him in hot water with the admins. soon wikipedia policy is going to change as many here know. id welcome some reasonable discussion and renewed work on the article. on closer examination of the history pages of the main article it appears some of malkes biased edits through sheer volume are still in effect. i propose going through every edit of his see exactly what changes of his have survived and put back all relevant sourced material. once that is effected we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements. having just returned to wp from an extended absence i am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave wp more than a year ago. i recognize malkes concerns. material that is added back should strictly follow wpblp ie. it should be directly relevant to rove not defamatory and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources. malkes concerns were one thing his methods another. admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material and as the admins noted to quote directly from malkes talk page history since he has since for obvious reasons deleted all reference to his blocking an impartial administrator just did i dont know you from adam and havent so much as looked at the contents of your edits all that matters is that you broke wprr and received a short block for it if you want to be unblocked all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. == o i highly commend the admins and urge others to support their work. these admins had not been involved here previously they took firm direct action on a disruptive editor malke who was judged to be making untrue statements regarding his efforts. i again suggest we move past this period of turmoil and examine what changes were made to this article by an editor whose tactics earned him a block,0

9302,the sources i brought up except all the media group connected to are also videos on youtube and some others. i could also bring sources like and many others. but seems to provide the most of information on that investigation the most detailed. you can always say they are political rightwing etc. and you can always call every investigation of any crime a “political game” because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it but there is an interesting thing if the law and justice party and all the “rightwing extremists” are pushing a faketheory of an assassination then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it? what do they have to hide? why the law and justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident? what you are trying to defend here is a theory of a ghostplane flying under the ground smashed by one of the armored birches that grow only in russia and you don’t say it’s a fringe conspiracy theory it’s an official true version just because the terrorists ruling in russia responsible for many other political murders – will you deny that? said so because they led an investigation on it and the polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them what else should they do?. and the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed... also one thing i have to add here do you know anything about the war between georgia and russia in and the role of l. kaczynski there? do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders lithuania estonia ukraine latvia went to tbilisi and forced russian army to stop the attack on georgia? see do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there in georgia? see . do you know that the katynmassacre was also a revenge? however after all i’m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions that about the fuel tanks. then the official reports must be lies too. as i know the fuel has to be mixed with air/oxygen in some proportion to explode otherwise with a surfacecontact with air it fires slowly. however it is all to be investigate by an international commission. and about the balance in the article the only reliable theory is about % of contents and you say it’s too much...,0

9359,here are the examples that i have compiled since being introduced to this issue. we have who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “’’’’’i have not attacked you. actually quite the reverse. i have not exercized censorship. quite the reverse. whats it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are?’’’’’” describes your actions as “’’’’’ rootless accusations of vandalism in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article police state dont even pass the straight face test.’’’’’” describes you as “’’’’’ the worst editor i have ever encountered on wikipedia’’’’’” while encouraging you to “’’’’’ please stop this childish behavior.’’’’’”. had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. i then placed a warning on talk page which he promptly removed. he continues to remove the warnings. has requested sources for the addition at least five have been provided yet refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war. is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page while falsely accusing me of stalking and sock puppetry. it seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the police state article without your viewpoint. this is against wpnpov policy. please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.,0

9361,youre right milo. a consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology. only that. wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. we dont ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star. we really dont care what they have to say. and of course we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology and more so than with other articles on science. i have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.even if i were pushing parapsychology i still would not try to censor the critics because that would only detract from my case the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.for stability reasons i dont think the article can take that approach. it would require constant maintenance and neverending dispute resolvements. nealparr that is why im talking about an arbcom decision. i want you to continue with what you are doing. it is great to get it stable for now with this definition of npov. in fact i doubt there will be much that is materially different when we get it straightened out. i wrote everything i wrote from the perspective i would think the article would eventually have anyway. so you know exactly how i would think it should be presented. there are only a few tweaks id make different like calling it a scientific field to begin with and possibly saying directly which types of psi scientists in the field think are real. so keep doing what youre doing ok? talk ψ contribs ,0

9381,not making sense is your words it makes sense to anyone willing to understand that those language terms have been used and written throughout the centuries while azeri words are varients of persian which you compare to azeri for its legimity to stay and arabic written in azeri characters which didnt exist prior to the th century. if you would stop taking this matter as a battle and read the article its introduction and the other languages which are there and compare it with those of greece in comparaison it could be considered as the name of the country you will see that your comparaison does not work. since while the article on greece was made to become just a name given to the country from various languages the one of jerusalem has made to become one of historic name. by now you should have understood this. each time there is a controversy on your behavior you disappear the same day to come back days later to jump in the same controversy the same way when you stopped contributing during the arbitration cases to escape scrutiny for this very same behavior.,0
9382,in fact rather than wait heres my complaintto whom it may concern hi. my names jim heller and im currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with jossi fresco. the background is this. i am a former follower of prem rawat a/k/a maharaji a person i believe is a nefarious cult leader. fresco on the other hand is a current follower and needless to say of a different mind altogether. for some years now ever since the advent of the internet rawat and his followers have engaged in a longstanding campaign to whitewash rawats past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history. the latest flashpoint arose just today when i tried to edit a wikipedia article of another of rawats current followers a religious studies professor in fact ron geaves who by the way just shot to flashpan infamy as the english academic who opined that the july th bombers were demonstrators not terrorists. please excuse the fact that to explain the problem in any meaningful way i have to flesh out the context somewhat. my edit concerned an academic not wikipedia article geaves had written where discussing a program rawat held in he wrote thatin november divine light mission had booked the houston astrodome a large sports stadium with a capacity of . the event had taken on millenial expectations in the u.s. with devotees announcing and advertising maharajis appearance at the stadium as a secondcoming complete with angelic and alien visitors. only attended the event and maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his american followers expectations. he spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.my emphasis here and belowin fact a widelydisseminated invitation to that same program maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the millenial expectations but fanned the flames substantially. thus he declared the program the most holy and significant event in human history and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significancea letter from guru maharaj ji bonn germany september dear premies first of all i would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. because we have realized this beautiful knowledge which is of great bliss to us all it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. for it is something they really need. in the world there is suffering hatred and dissatisfaction. that fact does not need proof. it is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. no one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. the world is looking for the perfect master to come and reveal the perfect knowledge of god. there is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the perfect masters coem to reveal this knowledge to people. we can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. as you all know millenium is being prepared for now. this festival has been organized by divine light mission each year since in the memory of the late satgurudev shri hans ji maharaji on his birthday. this year the most holy and significant event in human history will take place in america. i think that millenium is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of truth consciousness and bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. to do this i really need your help. i really need the help of all the premies in all respects physically financially and all other ways to make millenium come off. this is a festival not for you or me. it is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. i hereby invite you to this divine festival of peace millenium and request all premies to help me financially physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of truth. isnt it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this earth? blessings to you all sant ji maharaj it is clear when you contrast geaves claim with the documentary evidence that geaves bless his heart is playing the role of the typical cult apologist lying about his leader and blaming the followers the press anyone at all for the inexcusable laughable excesses of the cult. whats particularly worrying about geaves im sure you can appreciate is that as a religious studies professor hes imbued with a certain authority that,0

9492,another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to rick warren and saddleback churchhi steve. i dont mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation but you might say that duty calls. the contributions list for carverm indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with saddleback church including rick warren the purpose driven life warrens book the purpose driven church also a book by warren doug fields a pastor at saddleback and richard abanes a lay minister and former staffer at saddleback. there is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the saddleback church page in carverms user space here. it is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldnt qualify as an actual article. why is it there? ill note that the username carverm bears a resemblance to the name mark carver. carver was at one time described as a top aide to megachurch pastor and best selling author rick warren. throwing mark carver and rick warren into google yields hits that ill hesitate to characterize but there are strong indications that carverm is potentially not just another editor and may be tightly connected with warren.regards. ,0

9528, about disputed ethnic origin of persians the papyri from tebtunis record several sites in the fayum which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century bce. these include the village of the syrians syrôn kômê village of the arabs arabôn kômê and samareia which contained a sizable jewish population and was probably named after the city in palestine. although ethnic designations like boeotian macedonian syrian arab and jew probably refer to geographic origin persian proves problematic. its precise origin or significance is disputed. in the early ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with greek names functioning in a greek context although they enjoy a privileged status they are counted separately from greeks in tax lists. in late ptolemaic and roman contracts persian of the epigonê refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.persians june bce in this demotic contract summarized in greek at the bottom pakemis son of pakemis acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife tameische greek tameischis daughter of sokonopis and promises to repay it. here persian does not seem to indicate descent but describes a man with the status of a debtor. in this example the subject has an egyptian personal name but persian of the epigonê is just as frequently used to describe people with greek names. ii read and learn...,0
9529, september utcsimon baroncohen imagevery kindly provided by simon baroncohen who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. it is nonfree but with permission for fair use.image can be resized moved cropped and upload as second image with same permissions whatever but thought id better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan. its not an orphan since simon baroncohen points at it. id really rather not have this image in asperger syndrome for reasons already discussed. this article already highlights sbcs theories too much at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already. he actually gave it for this article so lets try and see what the consensus is? there is no reason why you shouldnt get images of other eminent contemporary researchers as well to balance? other editors such as sandygeorge have complained about a lack of images in this article. delete this one and there is only one small image of asperger. zeraeph is right get more images to balance it dont just delete. getting more images of other eminent researchers would balance the article only in that it would be better to have images of ehlers frith gillberg happé klin ozonoff rogers volkmar wing etc. than having just baroncohen. but this would be changing the article in the wrong direction not to mention being a source of further disputes. asperger syndrome should focus on as not on as researchers. with the exception of asperger himself and maybe wing who were instrumental in the history of the disorder the other researchers just dont make the cut. rather than head in this direction the article would be better off stealing the images from autism. if you take a look at the images in autism all but one are far more relevant to as than this image of baroncohen is. i agree with eubulides. sbc is already overrepresented and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a whos who gallery of as researchers for those attached to this idea. i agree with eubulides and soulgany. yes we need images and there are images that could be used to illustrate as sbc isnt one of them and gives undue weight to one researchers views. his image should be used in his article where anyone curious about him can find it but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off. talk ,0
9530,is wikipedia a patriarchal site? is wikipedia a patriarchal site? if it isnt may i then ask why a photo of a woman reading the quaran is constantly removed by islamists and noone bothers to do anything about it? i hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people including extremists and even terrorists. why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? they argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the quaran then perhaps the photo should be removed. even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks its his fault. heres what he said my wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the bible article and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. i personally feel that the image belongs in timur where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found but that it is inappropriate to include it in the quran article.does this sound normal to you? so if these extremists whom i dared to call talebans are offended by women then perhaps we should not have woman editors admins etc? i suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more liberal standards to wiki and enforce them with the sword ban these people please your admins removed my line where i called these extremists for talebans. how shameful heres the photo.oh no we see a couple of hands and a head with hair on it related link,0

9543,toward a better description of the collapse of the slathere is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the sla.the idf according to its plan of withdrawal started handing major positions in lebanon over to the sla in the middle of may . the collapse started on may . around a dozen villages and eight sla posts in the center of the front surrendered to hezbollah. the posts were mostly manned by shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by hezbollah. hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the sla in april . the threats were most effective against the shites in the sla.antoine lahad the leader of the sla was in paris while all of this was going on. lahads departure for france at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the sla. lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the july departure of the idf. he claims to not have been aware of the handover of idf positions to the sla in may.by the end of the day the sla front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the sla positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. on the morning of may the western druze sector of the front collapsed. there were in reports of a secret deal between walid jumblatt and hezbollah that led to the collapse.this triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the sla. shortly after both israelis and some elements of the sla were moving south. the retreat was finished by the early hours of may .israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the sla.the controversy in all this is what the israelis really intended to do in may. many senior figures in the sla claim that israel announced the july departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from lebanon in may . these sla people claim that israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the lebanese could not be trusted with the information. i dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.my view is that the sla collapsed out of its own internal weakness. the sla was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. hezbollah worked on breaking off the shite and druze elements of the sla. the shite portion cut a deal first. the druze portion seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.i think most of what ive wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time may . ive put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the sla collapse.,0

9546,blueboar this grand lodge is not just a website. it is a very well established and organised international organisation with considerable resources available to it in many parts of the world not least in the united states of america.because i am not very good at the intricacies of how wikipedia works you are currently able to take advantage and predictably you do because you are basically a brainless and offensive profane twerp.but because of what you are now doing you have spurred us on to appoint a full time wikipedia manager. this will happen. i will advertise the post next week and his sole duty will be to repair every single page on wikipedia relating to freemasonry with the sole aim of ending the ugle monopoly and to counteract you and your intellectually challenged coconspirators at each and every opportunity. you are in for a very busy time old lad.my son i am dying and you will be heirto all the broad acres in england that william gave me for sharewhen he conquered the saxon at hastings and a nice little handful it is.but before you go over to rule it i want you to understand this–the saxon is not like us normans. his manners are not so polite.but he never means anything serious till he talks about justice and right.when he stands like an ox in the furrow – with his sullen set eyes on your ownand grumbles this isnt fair dealing my son leave the saxon alone.you can horsewhip your gascony archers or torture your picardy spearsbut dont try that game on the saxon youll have the whole brood round your ears.from the richest old thane in the county to the poorest chained serf in the fieldtheyll be at you and on you like hornets and if you are wise you will yield.”,0

9611,conflict of interest policy hi ronzthanks for updating me on what a conflict of interest is. i know what it means. i have read somewhere on wikipedia that if it appears that a contributor is only writing about one subject there is likely a conflict of interest. this is a fairly broad and unfair generalization. i happen to have noticed a hole where a wikipedia page ought to be filled it and now any subsequent activity related to this subject comes from pride for my work in this instance specifically to make the best wikipedia page or pages i can. isnt that the point? doesnt wikipedia as whole benefit from this?im sure you could better spend your time mopping up after real and blatant cases of conflict of interest or advertising or whatever youre on the hunt for instead of monitoring the activity of a passionate editor.,0

9614, milton friedman etc. i really dont know what ive done or said to produce the attitude youre taking. you can disagree with what i say although i personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent kleins inclusion in the friedman article and i can be mistaken as i was in my first reading of the norberg link but i dont see how you can take things much beyond that. nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal unprovoked insults with which youve decided to base this discourse. you do know im sure that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. you seem to take things fair to literally or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. i dont mean literally that people regard friedman as a god and having to explain that feels rather odd but ive decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. it is simply that a large number of economists and rightwingers regard friedman as something similiar to god infallible and above normal human standards. if its not friedman than its classical economics as a whole which is apparently beyond any external critique. that i believe explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.regarding klein you simply dont have a point here its as basic as that. it it not the place of wikipedia to judge what is right in any particular set of affairs but to record those opinions which are notable. klein is a bestselling and wellregarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of friedman is one of the most wellknown in the contemporary world. it also covers far far more than chile. that cannot be dismissed because just because friedmans supports or for example a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. as such the rights and wrongs of norbergs critique are fairly irrelevent. although it could of course be included as a counter to kleins criticism within the friedman article there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of kleins views. now i know that a lot of friedmanite/friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there laws of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isnt likewise scientificic and that presumably hold the same assumptions but most people disagree.just to keep you happy ill discuss it briefly here. it has some very good points for example norberg convincingly shows there was a freemarket trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond kleins explanations although the actual area of discussionof kleins book were the far rarer radical fundamentalist reforms of the period but more on that in a minute he convincingly argues against kleins account of events in argentina and mea culpa china his ridicule of kleins shockshockshock metaphor which i myself found unconvincing as opposed to most her narrative and arguments is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence in many cases of friedman. but his page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semiaccuracies disingenuous argument and nearfalsehoods as to make any suggestion that it proves klein wrong or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments completely ludicrous. ill just list in no propersome of them since i dont have the time to do anything much else. he says she portrays the chicago school as a place that brainwashed its students as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. this ones just basic commone sense he says kleins friedman crisis quote isnt from any important paper but a preface to capitalism and freedom the preface to the guysmost important book he defining manifesto isnt significant? tell that to friedrich engels. he says that friedman gave the same advice to the soviet union china and yugoslavia yet nobody would claim he was a communist well klein mentioned this herself not claiming he was a communist but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.his suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the chicago boys didnt have control until later on is simply false. while pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove kleins accoun,0

9641,do you have any sources to suggest what these buddhist actually call themselves? they call themselves dalits for all i know.i have the vociferous complaints of the editors on this very talk page who selfidentify as buddhist for one. please read the entire talk page ill be happy to provide as many diffs as you like if you choose not to. for more sources there are several websites devoted to this. while they cant be used in the article they certainly can be used to clear up this point. moreover i know my wiki conventions far better than you. it is also not wikipedias mission to serve as a pr sourcewhat i do and do not know is arguable and remains to be seen. im certainly not advocating that wikipedia or this article become a pr source either for the movement itself or for those who oppose them.firstly buddhism never died in india.i quite agree with you if the internet is any indication. ive found different buddhist groups of varying strength in a directory aimed at listing buddhist groups throughout the world on a side note i plan to contact as many of these groups as i can for a seperate matter. that was just a cursory bit of research and not aimed at that particular assertion. im sure more energtic research will reveal more.its a nonissue and the discussion should end here. statements such as these show your unwillingness to debate and discuss the issue at hand. antithetical to cardinal wiki coventionsince we have a difference of opinion i suggest that we let an admin sort it out and youre free to seek one of your own choosing if you so desire. however id like to point out that an admin blnguyen has asserted the exact same thing on this very talk page. again please read the entire talk page its much appreciated. ,0

9650, i really think this article is quite confused in its basic definition the article starts off in chemistry periodic trends are the tendencies of certain elemental characteristics to increase or decrease as one progresses along a row or column of the periodic table of elements. this seems completely wrongheaded to me and completely misunderstands both the common and scientific meanings of the word periodic and why the periodic table is so called periodic things are those which repeat themselves at regular intervals. the periodic trends which mendelev famously noted in the elements when arranged in increasing atomic weight were recurring similar properties. it was on the basis of these recurrances that mendelev decided where to break the table into a new column or row. in other words the definition in the article is ass backwards. ,0

9676,otolemur from what i have gathered from your own editing you as i do strive for npov but as mentioned in that discussion above we are not wpcensored. some editors rushed to introduce multiple nazi references into the article and i object to using such analogies as disrespectful to soviet war dead but we cant make judgement calls on what to or not include based on our own sensitivities. the editor who objected is a new editor and whilst we welcome new editors by not biting them they will learn the above in good time and come to accept that this how wp operates. so having said that the chavez quote needs to be placed in its entireity as it was written as we are not wpcensored. if the word yankees remember to capitalise it offends said editor then all we as longterm editors can do is give him fair warning he is sure to see much worse if he/she sticks around and edits various articles. dialogue stalk me ,0

9680,i always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. the conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle shorting out the corresponding cap isnt quite right. what really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up or down depending on whether the + or ends are connected together and stays charged so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative. the reliable source we have cited there app note from a cap manufacturer says that you dont really need the diodes because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect. i would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode but given that its only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up i can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.,0

9691,well i left for two days anyway and i see no reason to dredge up a closed thread. i will say that the whole point of the thread as calton indicated was to not have to get involved in it myself and there was also really no need for an ip which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved. ips are nice to hide behind and i will bet money on the fact that its been the same person all along which is where my remarks came from. im happy to admit a mistake when i make one but this was not a mistake. i will stand behind everything i said based on the following line of reasoning a static ip is often tied to the same computer in an office mhec the ip location is not a school its a governing authority for the state schools in massachusetts so it has an office and an .edu address but not a campus of million people using a computer in the library. the chances of two different people on the same ip meaning at the same computer knowing enough of wiki internals to go poking around ani try to run for arbcom request a block for an admin and then have troll unblock requests hello is not a spurious unblock request really? is just too small for my liking. im sorry if im not going to agf that but i cannot suspend my disbelief that far and i got hammered for it. i neither expect nor require an apology but i do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread and that ips going to be a problem until someone takes care of it. ,0

9740, referencing referencing on wikipedia thanks to its primitive interface is a pain. there are a couple of ways to do it one widelyused method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. the meridian hill park article has a start on references its got a heading and a {{reflist}} template so youre partways there already. there are some extant citations in the text like{{citation title=roads to diversity adams morgan heritage trail url= author=cultural tourism dc date=}} and {{cite weburl= title=meridian hill park sports and recreation locations in washington dc on city guide publisher= date= accessdate=}}. you can see that the references are framed by or and in htmllike markup. you use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. when embedded in the text theyll cause notes to appear in the references section at the bottom of the page.in the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has at the left a button that says cite. clicking it will show a dropdown menu of citation references for web news book and journal references which then leads to a form that you can fill out not all forms need to be used and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. often for book references you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference and just say smith p. and go on.my main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. a certain dryness is called for but theres an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. its an interesting exercise. perhaps not joe friday more like bill gannon. have a look at the citations policy for more also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. the policies on no original research is important since wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.im certain youll have more questions please feel free to ask. talk ,0

9758, ephblog is a personal blog and is not officially recognized by the college. its format is unique only in that the ephblog name is generic and catchy enough to sound like it could be an official college blog. id guess that the name is the only reason the blog has the readership that it does. regardless the vast majority of content on ephblog reflects the views of david kane whether or not he frequently implores others to participate more. the subject matter may span all things eph but the viewpoints certainly do not. i dont think that this elevates ephblog above the status of personal blog nor should it make ephblog eligible for inclusion on this page.,0

9763,hmmm maybe it needs to be made more clear. it is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. i thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. it is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic. like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess not quite the same as stimulants dont cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift? thing is how do we reword it so other people understand. thank you for pointing this out mattisse.  t? ,0

9769,you are quite right that it is usually the underlying image that is copyrighted. if you make a perfect sketch or photograph of a francis bacon painting that will be covered by the same copyright as the original painting. but for these coins nobody owns the copyright to the actual coin. what the british library claims is copyright over their picture of a coin. if the coin was twodimensional we would just ignore them and add a copyright tag. but because it is threedimensional so the lawyer said but isnt an oil painting too then? we cant do that. but we can sketch their photograph because the sketch is not going to be the same as the original picture. it certainly all seems very odd to me but i am not a lawyer. i forgot to say that i got a copy of rumbles book the reign of cnut but i havent had a chance to read it yet so i cant tell you if it is going to be very useful. talk,0

9791,i could ask this on the project talk page but im probably just misisng a few obvious things. please let me know your thoughts on these via the afc category pages ive encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are not under review at this time. is that a bug? i felt like it was wasting my time. similarly a few that had already been declined. im pretty up on wp policies ive done thousands of edits created a few articles myself participated in consensus building and adminassisted special ops etc.. however im finding it hard to deal with the gnn reason codes and wikiproject templates. any advice? is this something that should really be in the script? what do we do with sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed even though they are in a review status? im not sure how they got there to begin with. for example i saw a page that was obviously intended to the user main page once he got his broken english repaired and it was far from complete yet it somehow had come into afc. really dont know how. any idea how it got to us? or what to do about any such article in review?i did approve one article but im not sure i did two things correctly for it. a i did some minor obvious content cleanup extraneous headings on a stub hide toc on stub move infobox to top. b i saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject a book series. after i approved it i edited the automatic message on the users talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one. were these two actions god bad or indifferent?if you think these questions belon in the project talk page fel free. honestly i think this project is begging for a newreviewerfaq. and maybe some screenshot tutorial. ,0

9794,i believe that the article did say this or at least used to. i have not checked recently however and it might very well have been removed or hacked up since this article seems to offend so many. i do not think it is valuable for me to defend it since there are so many hindus here and only one of me and i would very quickly be overwhelmed. however in the interests of mutual understanding permit me to clarify a few things. creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of christianity i cannot speak for islam. and there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in christianitynot as many as hinduism perhaps but in the hundreds for sureall interpreted differently by different sects. this is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of christianity. and it is true that some branches of christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them but again this is only true of a small segment. the difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble. i suspect similar things might be true of islam as well.,0

9905,as i say you cant read english closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.a pointer one of many possible ones on how not to construe elementary english.i am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history unless they are practiced historians.adoes not allow you to infer and repeatedly say that the meaning is nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics nor they believe in that science.where in that sentence do i state that i am unfamiliar with population genetics and disbelieve that discipline? i am saying nothing about genetics i am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline namely historiography. peerreviewed geneticists have rs credibility as geneticists not historians as peerreviewed historians have rs competence as historians not geneticists. sometimes you have dual competence as with c.d. darlington or jits van straten but the geneticists you cite if you check the historical books in their bibliographies use dated or unreliable sources for their history and make frequent errors as many reviews have shown.byou protest my writingwhat geneticists define as jewishness in europe relates to male founder genes and call me a racist who insults jews.here you fail to understand what geneticists define as jewishness. i am not using that language the view is not therefore mine. if you have a problem with this take it up with harry ostrer whose work you keep citing or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the dna reveal a biological basis for jewishness..reflect on this. you keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. its a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my english is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor making reasonable remarks is an antisemite. ,0

9941,bringitbringit is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multiplayer tournaments against each other for money. the site was launched in november by woodrow levin.in addition to the gaming provided the website allows users to blog create profiles and write reviews in the forums. bringit includes the following platforms xbox ps ps and wii. the main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.bringit’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount. players identify each other by their “gaming tag” an online id and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. when the game is completed both players report the outcome to the website or in the alternative result emails are automatically reported from the game’s end of game email reporting system. winning players then have their account credited. founder/chief executive officerwoodrow h. levin founded instadium and riverbank capital management. woodrow has been featured in media life magazine the chicago tribune and has been a guest speaker at the university of wisconsin school of business. woodrow received his b.a. in business from the university of wisconsinmadison and his juris doctor from the chicagokent school of law. woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including juf lynn sage breast cancer foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of the chicago green tie ball.how bringit worksall new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. microsoft sony and nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. our missionbringit is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money. bringit is a community of american and international gamers with the ability to play against each other hours a day days a week for real money.legal aspectsbringit is not in any violation of any united states or international antigambling laws currently in place. the reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance rather they are games of skill. games of skill are not in violation of the internet gambling regulation and enforcement act of . users are required to be at least years of age. certain us state laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in bringit’s skill based video game tournaments.games which may be played through bringit’s website for real money includeburnout paradisecall of duty call of duty world at warcoddead or alive fifa fight night round forza gears of war guitar hero world tourhalo halo warsmadden nfl mario kart mlb the show mlb knba knba live ncaa football nhl rainbow six vegas resistance rock band socom confrontationstreet fighter ivsuper smash bros brawlthe king of fighters tiger woods pga tour uefa euroufc undisputed unreal tournament xbox live arcadereferences edge espn fast company ,0

9954,woody allen i see that you have pointed out that you are an admin. this is good. however your handling of my edit to woody allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy. i will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin such as myself. i now understand your point about the first sentence. i just went out and found a reliable source for ronans comment in the second sentence. ronans comment is notable in hundreds of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both allen and farrow. i understand that i should not have put back in the first sentence but on the other hand your edit was wrong. yes i know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make wikipedia work better and im sure that jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make wikipedia better. you should have only removed the first sentence because it was not supported by a rs which is how it ultimately turned out. however for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article including the direct comment of ronan farrow allens only biological child. that was heavyhanded editing. the quote is notable. yes it was initially placed in the article by another editor with the support of a nonrs however it is all over the internet. it is quoted by literally hundreds of rss and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a rs to replace the nonreliable source. that would have been the correct way to handle the situation. i hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future. i fully expect to hear from you im just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative but i do expect to hear from you. let me just point out that not every edit that an admin does is perfect but of course im sure you already knew that have a good day,0

9959,i do not hate columbia college i hate seeing students waste their time. heres a fact columbia college is unranked by u.s. news and world report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings. this is because it is openadmissions. theres nothing wrong with wikipedia publishing an article on this school. there is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an openadmissions art school and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. wikipedia is not a brochure. being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. in fact the fundamental problem with columbia college is related to the quality it touts its big. its big because it does not limit its enrollments. there is a reason for that. its not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. if it did it wouldnt be so expensive. it does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. now the members of its administration its pr department and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality in order to make art one needs talent. talent is by definition inborn and innate. you dont get it by acquiring skill. you dont get it by purchasing the most expensive camera or the most expensive education money can buy. youre born with it and by late adolescence if youve got it it will make itself apparent. therefore any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closedadmissions art school one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. these schools are also very expensive but its possible to get various kinds of financial aid. once in the program the talented painter photographer writer or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. that creates an entirely different atmosphere one that keeps the student on his or her toes as it were and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. you might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. its because talent does not hide itself it is apparent to experts in the field. there are two ways in which columbia covers up this fact by telling students that if theyre showing up and willing to pay big bucks then theyre talented. its easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she and its usually a he who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. the other means at columbias disposal is that for the last thirty years children have been taught that selfesteem is the most important quality they can develop. in a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of selfesteem schools have simply stopped talking about talent. they might at times call it merit but that too is a bad word. so an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the drive to succeed youll succeed. the problem what if youve get the drive to succeed but reaching down within yourself you find youve got nothing to express?if you think columbia loves you try falling behind on your tuition. good luck.,0

9973,there is no reason to treat aff and sf the same. the neutrality policy which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them” certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself i won’t do your homework for you. moreover the merits of aff and the merits of sf are two entirely separate and independent things. no amount of slamming aff – even if your charges are accurate which i doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever by itself make sf worth including. sf must stand or fall on its own merits.there are many serious strikes against including sf none of which you have even tried to address. first of all it borders on being a blog which is already an almostdecisive point against it there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as i know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages including the same one we’re fighting over. equally importantly having read parts of sf... though i do not myself agree with the characterization i can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. to be blunt its largely the chronicle of one persons persecution complex. as i said elsewhere it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. and then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if i could credit the actual content. these three points – heck any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off wikipedia.and i haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. your site simply is not notable. as far as i can honestly tell you are the only person on earth who considers it an important site. if it was worth linking to someone other than the sites owner would have done so by now or at least spoken up in favour of such. that last part at least is welldocumented wikipedia policy look it up yourself as i once again refuse to do your homework for you. i am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack it is not intended as such and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others including me it’s not even close to qualifying as one. i wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of sf being linked from that or any other wikipedia page.,0
