5, question sarah there is something that ive wondered about for a long time that is related to coi editing. one need look no further than my user page where i quote chris hedges they control our systems of information. and add surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporateapproved encyclopedia. at a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easilyled lamebrained losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy. what if anything is presently being done? im aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to prove that he had no coi related to the articles he edits and ive heard of this incident dozens of times since where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest. many times ive wondered how wikipedia went about finding this socalled proof. if i put myself in a position in which i was editing for pay but denied it how could it be proven that i was? i mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have wp give him/her the wp stamp of approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please. they can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check. ,0

11, the size of wim crusios wiki page as of december nd the wim crusio wiki page constituted bytes of information where as the wiki page for ernest rutherford the father nuclear physics and winner of the nobel prize only has a wiki page of bytes as of december nd and maurice wilkins who won the nobel prize for his codiscovery of the structure of dna has a wiki page of only bytes while elizabeth blackburn who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in has only bytes on her wiki page. i could add many more names of nobel prize winners but if you wish to do so please feel free to compare the amount of information in wim crusios wki page to that of most nobel prize winners. i just thought i would point this fact out to the wiki community and ask for your comments on win crusios wiki page. please comment on weather you think it is too large and perhaps should be reviewed or if you think the wiki pages of ernest rutherford and many of his fellow nobel prize winners are simply too small. please feel free to leave your comments below this post.,0

14,so you want me to lie and say le grand did nothing wrong? i think you should look through more of his afd comments. many times he lists the dont destroy essay with wikipedia policies. lumping those together with no clarification on what is what isnt the correct thing to do. im sure many people do click the essay and see its opinion but there is others that just assume its policy due to it being listed with a bunch of other policies. im not an expert on the unblock policy but i dont think this is part of it. i see this therefore if you want to dig yourself out of this hole your first step would be to understand and acknowledge that grc hasnt been doing anything wrong this last year as very disrespectful to my views in general an admin shouldnt be posting like that period.,0

40, naji alali hi iani noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to . what is your source for that? im wondering because the arabic wikipedia article which this page started as a translation from cites his year of birth as while a book i have about him the one referenced in the article cites it as . what the book says in a footnote on the subject is sulaiman alshaikh the caricature artist naji alali in the kuwaiti magazine al`arabi no. august . naji al`ali saw this date and did not raise any objection. while the book is certainly not academic its also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is khalid al`ali the artists son.on the other hand on this page naji al`ali himself is quoted as saying i was born where christ was born between tiberias and nazareth in the village of alshahra in the northern galilee and i was expelled from there ten years later in to `ain alhilwe camp in lebanon.however the same site also bases its short biography of naji al`ali on the book i used and gives the year for his birth accordingly.unless you have a solid source i think we may have to leave it as unknown.by the way that site also shows a pretty cool pflp poster about his assassination i wonder could we get permission to use it... all the best talk ,0

47,actually undue weight can also results in zero weight. as it is the whole issue is insinuation and extrapolation of given events. just because the article doesnt outright say that edwards is the father because there was no father listed it is quite clear that this is the intent. now editors familiar with me consider me to be a fnc fanboy and appolgist regarding conservatives and republicans so my objection to this is clearly not a partisan point of view. that said this is in violation of several wp policies.,0

49,actually the format of titling appears to be dl on the cover in the orange bar at the top only. on both the cover and the title page advanced dungeons dragons dragonlance official game adventure dragons of ice douglas nilesthey are not called modules anywhere in the official titling though this term is still used to refere to them in dragon mag and in each other for example dragons of mystery page . i have no problem with aerie of the slave lords as this is a clear title for this series that does not need to be distinguished from anything else. clearly dragonlance is not available though if the modules had not spawned numerous other products it may be the title that would have been used. dragonlance modules is not specific enough.i am still inclined towards dl dragonlance modules. my second choice at this time is not on your list but very similar to some there dragonlance modules dl series. ,0

59,so what if konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers? thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category. dualpane behaviour is part of konquerors functionality not its whole functionality. you can play textmode tetris from within emacs. would you categorize emacs as a tetris clone?as for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management à la classic macintosh finder. they certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches. so it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there. besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software. but again youre missing the point as ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is usage of the term in qualified circles. ,0

80,youre kidding right? you think every reference in wikipedia needs to be a web based source so you can check it? from wpcite the citation should state as clearly fully and precisely as possible how a reader can find the source material such as by external link to the source website. if the material is not findable online it should be findable in reputable libraries archives or collections. if a citation without an external link is challenged as unfindable any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably findable though not necessarily reliable providing an isbn or oclc number linking to an established wikipedia article about the source the work its author or its publisher or directly quoting the material on the talk page briefly and in context. ,0

161,== attributing and classifying of personalities == invitation. your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed. some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here. i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word. necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania. we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat. renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us. cultural aspirations of the later nat. ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of lithuania. but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically lithuanian. i mean that such authors in as čiurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of lithuanian culture when in european or worldwide context. a parallel example may be taken from literature of india. poet tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india. making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture. but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones. this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n. ren. could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in lithuanian context. they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture. čiurlionis is the best example here. in other way the later lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life see the table below. we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramūnas bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism. period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period the younger generation approx – painter and composer čiurlionis painter kazys šimonis poet and philosopher vilius storastas vydūnas dramatist sofija kymantaitė čiurlionienė poets adomas jakštas motiejus gustaitis liudas gira composer stasys šimkus philosopher ramūnas bytautas. reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and postwar years. poets v mykolaitis putinas kazys binkis writer ignas šeinius – jurkūnas artists all ars group philosopher juozas girnius modernists introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life central european modernism. note lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence. jul utc,0

164,i was just released from prison on december . during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike. actually and / days started pounds ended up an estimated pounds. generally i drank two cups of milk in the morning and drank water as needed. i was never forcefed. nor oddly enough was i ever hungry or in appreciable discomfort. i was examined almost daily by prison medical staff. probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the bodys electrolytes calcium potassium sodium magnesium phosphate and to consume just enough aminoacids to supply neurotransmitters. if you merely drink water after a couple weeks youll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance and youll feel terrible. most people attribute this to not eating but i learned that its actually due to the electrolyte imbalance not the lack of calories. at the time the longest hunger strike id ever heard of was referred to in the capote book in cold blood by perry smith in the early s days. i could probably have gone two more months. ,0

213,the liber pontificalis is not sacred scripture and not i but the source quoted said that the decree attributed to saint peters first successor is probably apocryphal. is anything else attributed to pope linus? or was this the most important thing he did as pope? by all means mention that the liber pontificalis is said to contain that information. it was by oversight that i omitted the mention of the liber pontificalis though the fact that i have no way of checking that the liber pontificalis contains that statement probably hd some subconscious part in my forgetfulness.the question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to pope linus is aprocryphal. the letter of pope nicholas i is certainly genuine. i should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are i think less likely to go to mass wearing pants than without a veil and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil. if the pants question disappears from the footnote i will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article. by all means add the point that i regrettably forgot to mention that traditionalists do not like women in pants at mass.,0

273,welcomewelcome to wikipedia my name is ryan aka . i noticed that you were new and havent received any messages yet. i just wanted to see how you were doing. wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first since it uses different formatting than other sites that use html and css. in the long run though youll find that the wikisyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. here are a few links to get you startedhow to edit a pageediting policy conduct and structure tutorialpicture tutorialhow to write a great articlethere are a lot of policies and guides to read but i highly recommend reading over those first. if you have any questions feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. please be sure to sign your name on talk using four tildes to produce your name and the current date along with a link to your user page. this way others know when you left a message and how to find you. its easier than having to type out your name right? i hope you enjoy contributing to wikipedia. we can use all the help we can get have a nice day.sincerely . august utc,0

305, and use the confusing redundent yet common phrase north america... not refering to the continent. either of two reasonsa desire to place the united states last on the list by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find.simply an oversight. well nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u.n. subregions. its amazing that this list puts the united states last even though it has most of the people and / of the area. is someone trying to deemphasize americas importance? no its just in alphabetical order. talk about... any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states?? yes in the human geography section namely the rd paragraph. other related terms are also treated in that sxn. talk central americans are not north americans we are own people and we are not northerners. we are seperate from them and are nothing like them you can try to correct me but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down and sometimes other ignorant groups of people. i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this. i dont care what the white man tells us. theyre not us. we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be. this is just another way of bringing us down. i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us. if we have been living here for the longest time should it not be us who decides who we want to be? tito a. martĩnezthis is a lovely essay but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling. central america happens to be located in north america so central americans are north americans its a geographical thing not a cultural thing. perhaps youre thinking of latin america and anglo america? actually tito can undeclare himself. if youll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america you will see that spanish language defines north americas southernmost country as mexico. esnorteamérica redirects to esamérica del norte which lists the lists the following political units in north to south ordergreenlandcanadaunited statesmexiconote that central america is not on this listwilyd is also right as far as english language goes. north america includes mexico and central america. i think america terminology should provide a better explanation than it currently does. a section on english vs. spanish terminology would help. i dont speak spanish but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. maybe ill recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this. okay but ill claim the fatal flaw here is this américa del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america. tito may not be a norteamericano although i dont think he declares himself here either doesnt spanish have an equivilent to lacademie? but hes still north american. actually i dont think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans. his country if its in central america is a part of the north american continent but the cultural division is what hes concerned about. want to help me update america terminology? i think america terminology reflects correct english usage. maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints although im actively involved in that article and know itll get shot down as original research. roughly speaking there arent political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america not that im convinced the term exists in contrast,0

334,unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once. frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page. rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions. ,0

404,no apologies i make no apologies for what i said on the humanities reference desk. at times i may have gone too far elsewhere in wikipedia but not in this instance. when people say stupid things on the reference desk i have no qualms about pointing this out and am not likely to change any time in the future especially when it is unlikely the person who asked the question is being sincere. note that assume good faith doesnt really apply in the reference desk else we wouldnt be able to suggest that users are asking homework questions which we do all the time or otherwise just wasting our time which we do as well. i rarely frequent the humanities reference desk mostly science only so perhaps you dont get as many cranks at humanities but really i dont care. stupid questions deserve pointed replies. anyway ive said my piece and dont want to debate this anymore. as such im likely to ignore any further follow ups by you. if you feel my comments so bad that you wish to seek outside assitance thats up to you.,0

407, this article is a perfect example of doublethink. the leftists are making george orwells come true and turning our society into a bizarre illogical politicallycorrect nightmare where male and female are the same thing and interchangeable. this is postmodernist nonsense run amok and delusions by lunatics become accepted as fact by the leftist media. xy is a man. xy is a woman. xy has always been a woman. he is a woman trapped in a mans body. he does not have a mental disorder despite the fact that it is proven to be a disorder by psychologists. why are you calling xy a man? thats transphobia its racist and sexist and misogynistic and transphobic xy does not does exist he has never existed she is xx she merely looked like a man but has magically become a woman by her thoughts mental thought determines biology she is a transwoman not a man soft science psychology trumps hard science biology there is no such thing as biology whats a biology? thats transphobic you are a transphobe stop harassing this poor woman and respect her magical mental thoughts,0

411,first off i am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. i dont know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. as a life long resident of miller having both parents from miller i am well aware of the boundaries of miller. and your account is false...also i am not talking of this original town of miller or is supposed boundaries but the miller beach area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call miller beach a neighborhood of gary makes the very notion of miller smaller than it really is... i dont have agenda here. i just dont want my home town slighted by misinformation. it is the word neighborhood that is of issue. miller beach has several neighborhoods... it was settled almost years before gary was established. it is town that has been annexed. it is not a neighborhood of gary. it existed before gary. these are historical facts. is miller under the municipal control of the city of gary? yes...is it an area within the political boundaries of gary yes... is it part of gary? no,0

439,great but what i meant about weakest link is that i dont see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources ive seen have you got a source that places something called postindustrial in the context of the history of noise music? im presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag.unless the sources are good on this its too divergent in my opinion to include right now. some of what might be called postindustrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesnt warrant inclusion. you might as well do a section on deathmetal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music.personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composer/artist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i dont think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and thats why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. we now see a number of artists for example jeff mills being redefined as a postindustrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now. i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic. ,0

527,legally there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the schengen area there are such criteria for joining the eu but this is a different matter. the only possibility to join the schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu which includes a clause that schengenrelated eu law would be applicable in the associated noneu state. the associated state would only have the right to be consulted. thus the u.s. would have to accept each and every majority decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. and the u.s. would have to accept that every thirdcountry national holding a residence title of a schengen state could enter the u.s. without even being checked. to bil guadeloupe and french guiana are not inside the schengen area because this would e.g. require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french guiana and suriname brasil etc. with hightech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe. i can understand why they do not invest any money into this.,0

563,request for help = request for help hi again cat as perviously i have noticed a strong antigreek bias on several articles related to macedonia. ive had issues with both furper and beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour fyrom. ive officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious fyrom pov members of wikipedia. specifically balkanfever as i said verbatim on politis talkpage...this is a difficult battle because so far i am alone at the moment i am a newbie and as i said to one of the admins on notice board... i feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policemans ball. however i still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what i perceive as nonnpov behavior by these admins. i noticed while researching this issue youve also have problems with them. would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so i can add them to my report to show i am not alone? furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more greeks than me around here. would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if theyve also had problems with those two... and if so add those incidents to your list? and perhaps get them to contact others? where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. i will check back here in a couple of days. have courage. regards ...,0

589,replied talk please note that i did restore the revisions to talk rockerhi i couldnt help but notice that you have deleted several of my contributions that i worked very hard to create including several brand new pages that i had just made. yes i know these pages were short and lacked content but you must know it takes time to write a long and informative page on wikipedia. im just trying to contribute and i dont know why im having such a hard time doing it. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs im not sure that edits such as this back up your claim of just trying to contribute and neither do the three articles which you created this afternoon which were as you know were just made up nonsense example if plato was a christian this is what his philosophy would be called. qed. talk 飞天号航天服 飞天 deletion hi you deleted 飞天号航天服 飞天i think these qualify under since they are the original language names for the article in question feitian space suit so are indeed likely search terms. if someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name shouldnt they be able to reach the correct article? ... you used csd reason r recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers. however redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful as are redirects in other languages.this says redirects in other languages are generally useful ... hi there this is a difficult one i can see both sides of the coin. ive tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through categoryredirects from alternative languages but im still not sure. i have always read the redirect from another language as being more related to things such as kyiv topical one that one read the talk page but i digress or das wohltemperirte clavier rather than a literal transalation of every articles name in to other languages particulary those with nonlatin character sets. this is why i feel that the two mandarin? words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the english language wikipedia. but the bottom line is that i am one admin one opinion which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable. the redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. if they are renominated for deletion i will recuse myself from the process and well see what others think. sound ok to you? kind regards talk well theres the essay wikipediaredirects for discussion/redirects from foreign languages . the articles name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. ie. its a chinese spacesuit the actual name is in chinese not english. from the bit about nonlatin characters doesnt that indicate bias since english is used in hong kong as an official language where chinese characters are prevalent or india where nonlatin script is common and english is widely used. but we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type,0

593,thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously. to reiterate my original explanatoin to james im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about. for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article. see for example something like roe v. wade theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case. even if you really consider moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of godwins law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be. similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there? jul utc,0

683,i looked at the vandalism page and i have not vandalized the big o and dukes page.vandalism is any addition removal or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of wikipedia. the most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor page blanking or the insertion of nonsense into articles.any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism. even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. for example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — its just not helpful and should be removed or restated. not all vandalism is obvious nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial detrimental but well intended or outright vandalism.committing blatant vandalism violates wikipedia policy. if you find that another user has vandalized wikipedia you should revert the changes and warn the user see below for specific instructions. users who vandalize wikipedia repeatedly despite warnings to stop should be reported to wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism and administrators may block them.,0

719,i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteattempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape. if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader.i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do. to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal. and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway.further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists? paperclips? light bulbs?some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out.am i missing something? p.s. what do you mean about wpciv?,0

723, obviously there is some antiamericanism in canada. this means nothing necessarily with regards to the structure of this article. i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans. and i asked for another side of the story and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. your response here is confusing. as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article not making additions to the article. several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim antiamericanism on the basis of involvement in the middleeast... that doesnt mean its a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries. as far as your sources go you did not comment on the obscurity of them. you have still not properly defended james tagg yes that was me who removed that a year ago. i dont see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or rather inappropriate to add. i read that source left you detailed comments and you said something like dont pov push and reverted my edits. you are not making an argument here. re culture clash in archive again there are two sides to every story. please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed and why do students opinions have so much weight by the way?. but there likely wont be many sources to support this because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldnt exist for a counter argument. nevertheless ill take a look...one last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality and onesideness breaching neutrality. i am not trying to say that what youre saying is not true at all. im sure it is true the the extent that it is. but how much is that? the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article that they should be immediately moved.,0

727,deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists. so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert/yorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environmentfrom a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two. if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy ? this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.this scenario is dennetts and to some extent everetts. since the question doesnt even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. you might conclude that this question doesnt make any sense. but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not. in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy .to give an example of actual or and synth ill go beyond dennetts example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective. for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later. what is the subjective experience? from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? boltzmanns brain is a similar idea. ,0

771,there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white. users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view cited sources or not its obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong. i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what .% of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this .% obviously not including alun slrubenstein. when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another. all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke. you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist. so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a white person is just do us all a favor and either delete this article since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you get over it and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesnt scientifically exist. /end commafest ,0

804,as for your claims of stalking that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation. i have assumed good faith and good intentions on your part and have never suggested or seen reason to suggest that you might have some ulterior motive in massadding links to one specific companys web page. nor for that matter have i ever made any suggestion that this is an administrative matter or even mentioned such a role. clearly as a party to this disagreement i would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest. i would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. chatspy ,0

841, request regarding current rfar/clarification there is an open request for clarification regarding a sanction decided at wikipediaarbitration/requests/case/abdwilliam m. connolley see live link or permanent link. is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. i agree with him and unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised i support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. my reason for this it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at rfar/clarification and that i was blocked while this request was pending for comments made in the request itself is an additional impediment.there is no need for extra debate or argument. i have stated that i am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which i interpreted the sanction pending clarification by arbcomm. so the status quo is that the restriction is tight though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. i do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits and id argue that he did so consider. i accepted sandsteins decision clarification as a neutral administrator pending arbcomm review not future perfects who was already involved and i had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.i will continue to respect sandsteins tightening as standing and binding on me and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated and it did permit legitimate comment before arbcomm when i am an originating party as is normal. normally i can having filed respond there to comments from other editors also made there which is what i did. arbcomm specifically allowed me to originate a case and if im clearly involved as well i see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.i will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors and i will avoid in such a filing if it happens unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. obviously if i file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin i will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required which would only mention other disputes peripherally and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.i hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual rfar than there has been to the existing rfar/clarification which as it stands includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material i filed. its been pointed out by with clerk attention requested and nothing was done. nevertheless if the request is closed without action its moot. the real point here is that if clerks were following filings before arbcomm surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved and possibly the editor warned. ,0

859, response to third opinion requesthi im here to give your third opinion. i think its important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions. its not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards. it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused. theres no dash key on my keyboard. i know how to make a dash however —. but i do web dev and work for a printing company. and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and. i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and im writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page. so in my mind the question is whether this is a misconception or just ignorance. i believe that to properly call something a misconception it must be believed to be a rule when in fact such a rule is not correct. ive never heard anyone say just use hyphens for everything. it has only become the default because we have no dash keys. so i would lean toward excluding this entry unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes not just misconceptions. hope this helps. ,0

994,ive been working for some time on categoryroman bridges but you certainly provide new infos here. this is what a webpage says about the alconetar bridge destroyed in the th century arches left moved in i hope they did not change the arch structure then. here the most authoritative photo el puente de alconétar sobre el tajo en garrovillas cáceres cerca de alcántara estaba en la vía de la plata. debió de ser también monumental. fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo xiii y nunca después reconstruido. hoy día es un puente sin río. al construir el pantano de alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. en el año se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. apenas quedan tres arcos de los que tuvo. se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones. as for the pons fabricius there are some roman bridges and even more medieval ones whose arches are designed somewhere between semicircular and segmental. this is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. this means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semicircle character.,0

996,thanks moonriddengirl. wikidea im sure youre an excellent lawyer and i admire your goal to turn wikipedia into a superior reference work for law students its one i share with one amendment. wikipedia is not a legal resource for lawyers and law students. it is not a casebook. it is not a practitioners text. it is a work for the laypeople to explain as simply as possible in this case how the law works. thats what you should aspire to with your articles and its what i aspire to with mine. the layperson is more helped by thirdparty references and summaries than to them unintelligible case citations and full body quotations from judgments. while such quotations and citations have their place this i feel uses such case citations well but i might be a teensy bit biased they are the obiter not the ratio.,0

1000,have you looked at the ribbon international page? ,0
1001,{{unblock i am appealing a hour block that was placed on me before i could post my response via the administrators message board. i apologize in advance for the length of this but i believe that its necessary to include all of these details. i wrote a summary at the end so that administrators could get an overview if they dont have time to read the whole statement.i will be addressing the claim that i violated the rr rule in the second paragraph of this article according to wpblp biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subjects privacy... in a book written in a foreign language with a lot of jargon there are often competing translations/interpretations. and a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes misquotes dubious translation and outofcontext statements. as per wpblp i think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used and for the same reason the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.with than in mind on the th of february i improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with wpblp based on this source.userzero responded to one of my edits by stating that i cant read. and in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a wikipedia administrator told me in as many words to get off wikipedia.take a break i didnt take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which i was told by said individual that i had behavioral problems.said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics i started to write a complaint against you why do i need to know that? he can let me know when he posts it and then later responding to another edit he didnt like by saying that it was on my charge sheet.now the reason i am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the rr issueafter posting my version of the paragraph userzero subsequently changed it to this.i will post only the first few words of his statement and the sourcesource there is a reason to kill babies on the enemy sideuserzero babies on the enemy side may be killed .after those first few words userzero continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. now at best this is a serious distortion. and when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing sometimes contradictory sources rationales theories proposals and ideas many of which are subsequently discounted limited in scope or just tossed by the wayside the disparity the statement may be done and there is a reason is even greater.aside from the distortion mentioned above in contradiction to wpblp userzero also opted for a particularly liberal outofcontext translation.why did userzero replace my edit with his own. his statementprefer source with an actual quotationas i showed above he didnt use an actual quotation.furthermore after seeing his comment i searched but wasnt able to find any wikipedia reference to a such a preference leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own wpjustdontlikeit on me without explanation. his actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multipronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in i.e. encouraging me take a break.newlin,0
1002,this is untrue. i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true. it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me. usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing. the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false. i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently. having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulent..ism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me etc. is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate. in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so. although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc. that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system.there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this.you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc. so that is also impossible.                       ,0

1018,janettedoe i appreciate your finding and uploading the rao articles. however this can easily become an endless discussion. for some other yadavapologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than rao and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the yadav apologists are not and have no intention aware or unaware of being—will go scurrying again for the article. after that we all will try to interpret it weighing the pros and cons again to a degree the apologists will not for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path. i think we cant make the determination of whether rao applies here or not at least not yet. let the secondary sources do that. we need to rely on recent scholarship especially that in textbooks published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds. two such books by susan bayly and christophe jaffrelot both widely used in universities around the world both reviewed extensively in the literature are being used in the article. let the article writing or rewriting proceed based on these or similar books. once the article has been fleshed out we can come back to the issue of rao. otherwise nothing will get done and those of us whove taken time out from our other wikipedia not to speak rl pursuits to attend to the article will slowly walk away out of touch and out of sympathy. «talk» ,0

1029,yes you got it the govt lied. see the talk page for cselr ok im lazy and not typing current page name. they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from. i have provided the link to the index of papers produced mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw so you can confirm that the business case was never provided. there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary. some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and posttfnsw publications such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are % lower.. i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about. that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language. the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions. the terms of reference open to the public to see for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this. i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past selfproclaimed senior executive of tfnsw. so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group. = link to index of docs produced for st call that is why there was the nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at. by making the nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the st call they made it public. the outcome they expected was what ended up happening.,0

1032,this article is being rewritten at jack abramoff/abramoffrefactor. please take note of the existing notes and outline and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. comments welcome. thanks archives archive friday th august talkjack abramoff/archive i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. copyviothis article and its sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia. theyre essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal. both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia. they need to be deleted immediately. alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio. tyco as below was edited the text was accurate but half the news story was pasted in here. you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story attribute a link and it not be a copywrite violation. its called plagerism. tyco almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article. ive removed part of it as it needs to be rewritten. i think ive cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up hopefully. there is alot of nonessential stuff in this article about peripheral people and not about abramoff however. it needs to be cleaned up more as the article meanders alot here and there. i reverted some things you took out outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about delay. that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted. it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it. just providing a link is not attribution and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism not fair use unless you are quoting. also if you are going to say the los angeles times reports you need to source the times not a secondary source i.e. democracy now.i modified the quote and attributed properly. the speech from tom delay is a direct quote its in quotations so of course it is taken wordforword from the source. ill tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. heres the primary source for the other thing. no problem. if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first and then rework it i dont usually just leave it out if the quote is accurate. btw have you found a link for the franken quote i cant find anything other than on blogs. honestly im not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is really anyway. the forced abortions part was originally reported by brian ross at abc news for / on march . it also appears in al frankens book the truth with jokes in the tom delay saipan sex tour and jack abramoff casino getaway chapter. since weve agreed that primary sources are key ive change the attribution in the article. the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed norquist etc pages to it.basically we need fewer facts and more context. at the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. i moved the whole scandal to its own page. this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players in particular ralph reed. i am not doing this to hide the scandal i think that people looking for info on i,0

1084,speedy deletion of mass masud a tag has been placed on mass masud requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate such as at articles for deletion. under the specified criteria where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted it may be deleted at any time. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. talk ♦ contribs ,0

1127, i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world. you still prefer previous title i.e. united nations statistical divisions to the current one i.e. united nations geoscheme?if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones. google this statistical divisions site the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments. google this statistical divisions sitetherefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m. . un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical. i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping. natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country. i use it quiet often. it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as un geoscheme. try google book search and you will find at least the followingthe best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia. as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories....the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region ....country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification....were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme /unsd/methods/m/... that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme. in fact ...i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc. have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research. this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better. although it is not official term or a technical term un m. i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m. . moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm. of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidence/citations here before i bring it to rm. comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ,0

1221, april utcyou are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. in your last revision of the article you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. once again the statement about public schools and id materials was unsourced when you first added it which is why i removed it. upon further examination i removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the centre for intelligent design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. it is actually very unlikely that this centre for intelligent design did so in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in and this organization arose in . finally believing in the historicity of adam and eve does not make one a fundamentalist. many christians reconcile the genesis creation narrative with science see the biologos foundation for example which advocates evolutionary creation. the entire roman catholic church billion people teaches the historicity of adam and eve and that does not make them young earth creationists or fundamentalists. i have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. i hope this helps. thanks talk ,0

1339,=some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cultlike fashion according to some accounts the third international operatives from various countries in the s were treated virtually as cult zombies by stalins cynical bureaucrats. arguably himmlers ss included cultic formations trained at that castle wewelsburg? where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air possibly this is a street legend. as to north korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leadercult religion probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a stalinstyle personality cult since even stalin never strove for such a level of quasireligious worship and regimentation. but im not sure the term political cult is appropriate in reference to north korea since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that dont wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secretpolice power of a postrevolutionary dennis king sept ==,0

1346, israelipalestinian conflict protect? yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this. it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc. wiki articles i have referenced why not this one? thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints. and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict. it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus. i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic. you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased. do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source? please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous. if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers. there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise. i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks. apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page. i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on wiki saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see. repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive. protection is not an endorsement of the current version. zman the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. clearly there is something seriously wrong. as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan. worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes. if the events at this article really offend you it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk ,0

1372,csd aokay sorry about that i was just really confused as to what they were pertaining to but i now see that there is a main la liga article that does provide context. thanks. sorry that was my mistake i misunderstood it. thew user i know its this guy. the article clearly should be deleted and an afd would be pointless. if i were an admin i would block him right away and delete his stuff. well blocked isnt banned. repeated block evasion might result in banning though. moreover i actually deleted an artcile of his per wikipediaarticles for deletion/quantum ring theory. that mentioned some naveen dankal so the latest account might be also be likeminded person. ill give him a welcome page and then well see. oh youre an admin? i thought there was some sort of rule that admins had to say so on their user pages.he might not be technically banned but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were. i dont know how else to deal with this. not sure about the rule but i actually forgot to restore my user page after latest wikibreak.for the moment i assume the two accounts are not the same. if not well certainly notice and can take action. heisenbergs scientific method naveen dankal with due respect to heisenberg and his contribution to science i don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidual.i have only stated some of the limitations of heisenbergs works with due references and just brought out a fact how heisenbergs method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way lopesidedness of our universe.i just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia. on the other hand i also disagree with the block you received resp. the unblock denied and have raised that point. thanks for unblocking...appreciate your step...will try to keep wiki rules in mind may well let me know once you have further concerns or questions. naveen dankal i am making a few changes in the article on heisenbergs scientific method.i would like to know wether any refernces to banned members works jeopardizes the articles chances of getting hosted or such refernces can be incorporated without any hitch. moreover before hosting the articles can they be emailed to the administrators for a review so that the users are not lead to the worries of being blocked or banned?there are two different issues. the . while that doesnt mean they can never be cited it is unlikely to go without discussion. your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations. what is missing is the intermediate step what reliable sources have written about e.g. the mystery of the scarcity of the dineutron or limitations of the copenhagen interpretation. without including such secondary sources it will be a wpsy,0

1381, msa garratts hithe idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error. that is understandable as the subject is complex. the wagr first imported the m class garratts in . these are very important locos because they are the third class of garratt to be built and the first main line garratt showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated. so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. both classes were built by beyerpeacock.the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops. apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.the story does not end there but moves to victoria. the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. outside framed garratts are very rare even in the smaller gauges. but wait there is more no not steak knives. the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g.so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed.personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients. some work would be required to hunt down variations though. so yes i think it does deserve an article.please feel free to use the above if you wish.cheersmichael.,0

1492,ahh yes. by mormons in this instance i do mean members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints. i can see how youd read that section in this way. perhaps we can clarify what do you suggest? it is not that the doctrines changed but rather that what smith emphasized changed. what is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and as you likely know has always been the case. many things that church members believe to be doctrine is not but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members. in any case the teachings of smith and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate or that he changed doctrines or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters. we have to balance this to be historically accurate with what is believed and taught today. not an easy task. im open to suggestions in how to change wording. lets discus here and then make the changes. suggestions? also id invite you to join wikipedia. we always need newcomers. registration is easy ,0

1497,i disagree that vowel harmony is the place to discuss imutation in welsh. i see no reason why this article or umlaut and amutation for that matter should be restricted to germanic. i think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid regardless of what language its attested in. likewise amutation shouldnt be restricted to germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well again an example from welsh gwyn white masc. < windos vs. gwen white fem. < windā. umlaut should mostly be about the written sign with an indication that it also the name for processes like imutation and amutation. vowel harmony should be about the lefttoright processes typical of uralic and altaic languages. thats what i think. /comhrá,0

1502, yeah i think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors arent just mere repetitions of the authors statement and dont elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. also ill like to point out these mistakes in your comment per eliade approximative understanding partly of apparently nonarabian rites so not mucheildae never says it was nonarabian. shes talking about monophysite rites and monophysite was the largest branch of christianity in arabia. per watt details that may be surmised by close analysis muhammads lifehe also argues that these verses might be attacking christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. also in the final ill like to say again the subject of the article isnt about quran and its historicity and interpretations. so adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text. ,0

1506,=the signature of the atomic bombthere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of japan marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per october or dhu alqidah or heshavan . butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. except from this it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. first. art by artists working both before the world war ii during and after can not necessarily be defined as more or less contemporary because of this timestamp. contemporary art did explicitly exist also before world war ii as this label contemporary has been expressed as a mark of quality pertaining especially to modernism by art carrying an ideal summoning from the artist or his genius making some kind of composed expression of what in such case are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world in the event of the artmaking process including its publication or presentation. another trickster is for me that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. it is absurd as a norwegian to not consider henrik ibsen a maker of contemporary art. his plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. i sincerly believe that henrik ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed or may i say be transported by the unfolding of time. the retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the th century. i think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.,0

1591,the ezekiel passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclopædidia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to yahweh along with jeremiah .. both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable. the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god. it is cited in encyclopædia britannica moloch with the comment note also the attitude of ezekiel in xx. seq. references which cannot be explained away. the article the international standard bible encyclopedia molech moloch treats it rather strangely remarkingthat this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live ezekiel given by god to his people by way of deception and judicial punishment as some hold is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.it is not clear what this means quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold. this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to yahweh. it also brings in bogus molochworship in connection to carthage. not a good article in any case.three different rabbinical interpretations of the ezekiel passage appear at . the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning disliked by trs but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. that would not be a reason to suppress rashis interpretation and the writer does not do so.there is a discussion at which covers in part john days treatment favorably but also discusses the ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the peoples belief and apparently ezekiels beliefs that commands which ezekiel saw as bad came from yahweh. note john day believes moloch is not yahweh but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.in short the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by yahweh. it has long been in general a problem pasage. but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response which seems to me weak. but add it with a citation if you will. but do not suppress.the inclusion is not editorializing by me. i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. the ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to yahweh and normally used as support for that argument indeed one of the main sources for that argument. my own pov as much as i have one is that the evidence is confused there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to yahweh. even when when that interpretation is rejected the ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.i dont believe that anything i have included in this article including the ezekiel passage is nonstandard for discussion of moloch. i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. one obviously cannot agree with all sides. moloch cannot easily be at once yahweh an entirely different god the name of a kind of sacrifice. passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. please let the normal statements used as arguments stand regardless of the positions.i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound,0

1602,its in the history or more conveniently in your own contribs. thank you for the explanation but that wasnt a big deal. i was more upset by your second post—waving me off with a sneer about growing a thicker skin and a fingerwaggle about profanity—treating me as an insensate piece of internet polemic rather than a fellow human attempting to give an honest account of herself. an account which mackensen promptly removed as you say. well i understand that trying to contribute to the workshop was a bad idea in the first place—running full tilt into tony sidaway after managing to avoid him on irc for a whole month to the immeasureable improvement of my quality of life. anyway. ive always seen you as somebody who stands up for the underdog — i remember praising your addition of this edit to the harassment guideline—and i was sad to see there was no mutuality of respect. talk .,0

1612, sorry that you feel this way malangali. i dont suppose that i can persuade you but i did try and do my homework. iringa is not offically designated a city at present unlike mwanza dar and arusha you asserted this in the article but it is simply factually incorrect. a seperate question is whether iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the tz governments definition. ok. first i assure you that urban can imply either town or city particularly when contrasted with rural see urban area. i checked two english language travel guides for tanzania both of whom use town. moreover i contacted some tanzanians in iringa who agreed that it was town rather than a city not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in wikipedia just to try and convince you that the town thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint or whatever it is youve decided i am doing. i dont believe in individual ownership of wikipedia articles. however city is not the best word here and its entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. again i regret clashing with you on this and im very happy to discuss and change my mind on things and im glad youve improved this article but im afraid i will not simply agree with whatever you say just because im english and you i presume are a tanzanian. ,0

1648, ufc afds those were never transcluded to the afd page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing. im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the afd banners from the articles ill delete the afd pages when i get the chance. i havent been able to spend much time on wikipedia lately. looks like theyve been officially listed as afds. ill leave them alone for now. jake bostwick ive only nominated a few very obvious mma people before. bostwick was deleted via afd discussion. a speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied. to me he still fails wpmmanot but im in no way a mma expert. what do you think? at first glance it appears that bostwick hasnt fought at the highest level of mma as required by wpathlete or whatever the guideline is these days and wpmmanot. if i had an interest in having the article removed i would afd it again. hello it has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. can i first point out that jake bostwick is a former ucmma middleweight champion and currently the ucmma welterweight champion? ucmma is along with bamma and cage warriors the biggest mma promotion in the united kingdom. secondly after glancing over wpmmanot and wpathlete i see that they are indeed guidelines. now i may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in afds as the sole reason why to delete any article. thirdly i have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page i have found very strong sources from websites such as the sun the mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called party wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a wheel clamper only strengthens his notability. the very sources on him alone helps him pass wpgng which is all you need to pass a page on wikipedia in my opinion.i would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion i find is a bit disrespectful towards me however i fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now i have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more. userpoundpound since you filed the spi i wanted to update you that ive reversed the block. i requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation. i had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however i fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case. i completely see why you reported it i did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here. just wanted to update you. ¢ © join wer alpha chi national honor society copyright i made changes and enhancements to the alpha chi national college honor society page including citations to sources. the director of operations contacted wikipedia granting permission for material from the website to be used by wikipedia. she received a reply indicating that it was safe to move forward with the edits. nearly a month later you removed the edits. is there something im missing here?a copy of the email sent to wikipedia and the replydear lara noahthank you for your email. our response follows your message.// lara,0

1761,hey. it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. you have to change this attitude on your part. your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. you guys are of course wrong. you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine. your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia. i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason. it is just plain innacurate....,0

1869,lol you know what i meant. whichever president came before hafez i just new he was president before assad has considerable foreground of support in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. they would have claimed instability would arise as assads supporters are trying to use in their defense. what i am trying to say is that although bashar assad had good economic and international policies for syria you should not fear a nonbaathist potentially being elected. syrias economic and international policies wont change iran would still be a major factor in syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms and for the better. also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. the muslim brotherhood in syria is weak even weaker than the islamist prescence in libya. the rebels in libya had % support as we see now and yet could hardly take control without nato. what chance does the syrian muslim brotherhood have? none. if anything nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the muslim brotherhood making them less of an influence in the everyday life of syrians. as you know i am pro syria and armenia just not pro assad. unlike armenia where people like sargsyan and kopcharyan were democratically elected assad was not no one ran against him because they were not allowed.,0

1878, talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you. peter iii of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin? your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. the reasons to prefer the coin areit is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w/ a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese kingin your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. srnec the problem is that we have different criteria.you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information.i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. the two representations have the same chance of not being % accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other.if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing. but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time. i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary. do you have an argument? why are your criteria better than mine? really? when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons. but i do not want another long discussion with you. i offer consensus. would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? both of those are improvements over the thcentury image but not over the coin. at least one other editor agrees with me. sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. this discussion is already too long. both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life. either both seem right. imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. you are not allowed to impose your will. both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles. they were reviewed by several editors. stop with your edit warring. lecen is aware of the threerevert rule. are you? youve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours. you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.,0

1911,the titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles. you see the nature of fiction is that its not necessarily coherent. since this article is not about malcolm wilkerson in the first episode of the show malcolm in the middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. for the entire rest of the seven season run the characters name was only malcolm. this is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy. a title like malcolm xxx my appear clumsy but wilkerson is not an alternative. in my opinion. if cant build consensus on this between the two of us i suggest asking for additional input at wikipedia talknaming conventions since i didnt find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although im fairly sure the fact that the characters name was wilkerson only during the first of episodes of the show means that calling the character wilkerson esp. in the title is inaccurate. — ,0
1912,thanks. i nearly drowned when i was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath but somehow i managed to swim back on board s.s titanic. ironic really given what i see coming up ahead. perhaps i should have saved myself the trouble and just stayed in the icy water.your comments are interesting and may well be correct however they dont really address the point i was making regarding the gross almost embarrassingly obvious errors in the academic geek created/mindless computer driven financial models currently used around the world. the most similar theory to the one ive pustulated above comes out of this piece from the prophet robert k. landis where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis. ludwig von mises obviously had similar ideas but no one has really done the hard financial modelling on this austrian school theory and tried to collect longterm historical data tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels the frequency and severity of socalled black swan events in financial markets. my hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels you will see bifurcating bell curve returns i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness.landis comes close but still no cuban cigar. anyway his piece is very topical right now and made for interesting bedtime reading tucked away here as i am in my tiny little third class cabin far far away from the mad money crowd. ,0

1918,i actually hadnt even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization audio that you both have proposed. i could make the issue a little more complicated though graphic equalizer not yet written smiley face curve parametric equalization and british eq all have to do with what ill call music equalization for lack of a better term. this includes sections and of the current equalization filter along with possible future articles tone controls loudness control combine with smiley face speaker equalization etc. oh im certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles but could as well be topics in one article except that a few of these already exist separately. the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer but has become the accepted term since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someones taste not strictly to compensate for a channels frequency response.then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization or some such term which would include section of equalization filter telecommunications lines riaa equalization fm pre/deemphasis as well as equalization of nonaudio channels this is the orginal meaning of equalization. such equalizers are generally nonadjustable by a user at least and transparent to the end user. so i call it a different subject even when it is audio. anyway i dont have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems. though id be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues. come to think of it i dont have to ask for permission ,0

1953,with respect you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. getting off the subject a little but it does have some relevance the nz herald routinely refers to nzers of european descent as pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. of course i would not include this in any article and defintely not this one without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of hits for rooster found in nz media. many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry. clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the countrys readership than poultry.just stating both cockerel and rooster are used is factual whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.also i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both cockerel or rooster are common.,0

1967, locations thailand.while phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in thailand that includes sex tourism. pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism. i dont know phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more nonsex tourists so if i were going to identify a place in thailand if not the world i would mention pattaya instead and i am tempted to edit. i hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more sex for money going on in pattaya than phuket. but for someone considering the phrase sex tourism as not necessarily pejorative i have to qualify this conclusion. note that bar girls in thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general thai population also. although i beleive that there are words in thai for prostitute they mostly at least the girls prefer to call themselves rented wifes albeit for short time rather then long time. i therefore need to be qualify my pattaya versus phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the longterm married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the wifes direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both. there is no such thing as a free lunch and everybody pays for it. note that i neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing and moreover consider them culturally aware particurlay thailand wise. the fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones one must be aware that labels concepts ideas such as sex tourism carry suggestions associated with religion particularly judeochristiamislamic jdi pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the religious worlds worldviews outside of some tribal village usually buddhist and what i like to call giesha cultures e.g. japan thailand etc versus virgin cultures typically jdi that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. note that thai society is strangely contradictory in this regard arent we all but then thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west. perhaps some historioreligious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also. i hate value laden western and religious labels that dress themselves up psuedoscientificly as culturally universal. exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more exploitation going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like chinese factories where labourers girls included work excruciating long hours for a few yuan or rmb. ,0

1982,ideas ideas hey hows it goin ginkgo? i had a couple ideas i wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought you’re the editor. heres what’s going on in my headfirst i was looking at the bill ritter politician article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. you scored that good shot of ritter at the cdc and thats about all the color weve got. so i stopped by ritters campaign site and found a great screenshot off kusa of the latest poll numbers drop by and take a look if you can. i thought maybe this might be worth uploading if applicable didnt check yet and using in the ritter article and colorado gubernatorial election . what do you think?in a related thought i stumbled upon the video of the ritter/beauprez debates from aug. heres a link . other articles ive read have contained video but this one might be a little to long any thoughts? and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto wikipedia.second im going to plunge into a cleanup effort that looks a little challenging over at national western stock show take a look and youll see what i mean. if you can and you like whats one of my favorite events in denver drop by the article and help me out a little.thanks for the help ive written a lot here my apologies. see ya around have a good one.,0

1993, north korea actually gained approximately km² from china in the treaty. and heres a th century book by chong yagyong titled koreas northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by peter hacksoo lee a long time ago the area north of the tumen river was the land of the sushen people. it has not been under our control since the time of the three han. the southern slopes of mount changbaek where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters lay within our territory but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. however emperor kanghsi in the final years of his reign ordered area commander wula wula tsungkuan muketeng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. as a result the border between those two rivers is clear as well. emphasis mineheres another study of the usnorth korea border in by the us dept of state which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain. and another which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in . the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border and of course a few ultranationalist sites but please enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. on another rather amusing note it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits and which prefer to judge a book by its cover and lash out emotionally. should be made in a new section on the talk page. no further edits should be made to this section. the result of the debate was no move. requested movechonji → tianchi – the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus for pov reasons cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean its on the border between china and korea. another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well. however a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi and and less than each for chonji and cheonji. thats two orders of magnitude in difference. the preceding was quoted by yuje surveyadd support or oppose followed by a brief explanation then sign your opinion with support for the most common name. searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake. the use of chonji as a clear common name doesnt apply because its not common. support — per yuje. naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. oppose per visviva and my previous comments. like i said before we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china. as shown chonji is nowhere near common. chonji barely shows up any hits therefore isnt a viable alternative for a clear alternative name. oppose look at my reason below. comment the proposition seems to be flawed... given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else perhaps tianchi changbaishan or even heh heh tianchi paektusan but then again maybe tianchi jilin... if we must have a straw poll it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is. comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldnt be ignored. thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi disambiguation page. either one is a reasonable alterna,0
1994, november utc and i dont believe this is just a minor set back. and i wish you understood the gravity of it all especially thibbs who has seen this behavior overall even in my own talkpage. but like i said the torture is not even knowing what the disruption even was. i would like a direct answer please. thibbs you are the one who pushed for a consensus and claimed it to be necessary even when it was confirmed broadly construed.im willing to work on several articles that appeal to my current schedule and need to have an interest in the subject . wpvg and wpanime had allowed me to access mostly online sources. so i would like some that can be up to ga class using mostly free online sources. i would also like to participate in a wikiproject that definitely gives me enough room to start. i dont have the time to look for something completely online.but only if someone can give me an answer. im going to say it again it is torture trying to move on in wikipedia and knowing absolutely nothing. ,0

2032,i repeat the text was about a minority school these schools were the same for every minority not about the treatment of germans in the public. secondly the weak identity thing is a nice lie because then you have to explain why the slovaks did not have weak identity in romania or in serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in hungary although the opposite was the case after the population exchange i will answer you because their schools were shut down in the s. thirdly you somehow forget that whether the minorities not only slovak have a weak identity or not the hungarian government unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction you can play with words but that is a fact bilingual schools even if they would work which they did not are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the magyarisation and this aim was successfully achieved. or are you implying that since the minorities had such weak identity the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language?? do you actually read what you write? ,0
2033,xkcdhey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me randall munroe labeling it patently madeup information. understandable and taken in good humor of course and nothing on the page is sourced its more of a stub than anything. but im curious why you were so sure it was fabricated. xkcdi find it hard to believe that a yearold could have been working fulltime for nasa. of course you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe. schreit mich an i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated. i stayed for the better part of a year until late . nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects. its not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.anyway the information is taken from my published bio page but youre right you have no way of knowing whether im lying or not. i guess its probably safest to assume that i am.in that case ill admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place i know very little about science but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area. feel free to readd the info although the impression i got from the original version was more than you werent just a contract worker. if thats not even a valid distinction in the states its increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance. schreit mich an honestly they never really explained to me which one i was. i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots and nasa paid me through a government contractor. when i said i work for nasa no one argued. it was a lot more dilbertesque than you would expect. old echoing tile hallways with quiet gruff middleaged men working at blueprintcovered desks mild office politics lots of presentations and buzzwords and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way. i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work and it was good in a lot of ways but i was happy to leave. xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. actually this thing is new to me. thanks sure thing. the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook. that gets put onto the suggestions page which ill move it to in a moment. over the next few days people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long if it needs sources whatever else. if youre able to respond to those comments if there are any made then your article might get selected. schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what its not easy to do that since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page so i really cant just point you to a page and say here you are. what particularly do you want to see? if youre after examples of the kinds of comments people make just keep an eye on the suggestions page. schreit mich an caucasian ethnicitiessemites are caucasian. or indeed not. see for example semitic which clearly indicates otherwise. they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indoeuropean people who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless theres some startling new research out there i dont think that comment is accurate. schreit mich an im not even going to dignify this with a response. use,0

2088,thanks for the copyedit omg it reads so professional. i appreciate it a lot. yeah i knew that that would be a problem. okay heres the back story to it. danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. during the after party in which the theme was a black light one everybody could see that danny still had paint on him as it hadnt washed off or something. to be sure jack had a black light switch in his apartment and when liz came in he turned it on which resulted in liz having the paint all over her see here. or if whatever i just said doesnt make sense read here and here about the paint still on danny and the black light attack.yeah i thought maybe if people saw that the ga note they wont leave me a message. though that didnt work as a user left me a message regarding an article i reviewed. this has to work in the future. im a have to make it better. i still havent gotten the chance to see it but i have to see it. i need to know what happened and stuff. well after i got the news that he lost i started watching his dvd and telling myself that ill never see his wrestling moves again. i didnt cry i was just sad. the night on raw i lost it and cried. whatever i didnt think that was cool. shawn didnt mind but i did. not really i still dont see that face like quality to him. i think theyll play randy out like triple h you know good with the crowd but still have him heelish. maybe cause all the new people are heel and they need some faces... who knows. speaking of randy todays his birthday turned . well if you remember his first punted victim was shawn so nice to see that he did that to cody... all in the storyline nici. you are welcome for danielson and miz i guess. hit ,0

2103,negatively biased articlethe following was entered into the article text in these edits by ... whomever wrote this wikipedia information has a clear bias and is absolutely against dr. albert rivera. in this biograpgy he is promptly attacked as a fraud before and after stating the life of dr. alberto. the refrences of public magazines where dr. rivera is pointed as a fraud are commentary opinionated and are not mere fact. it is clear that dr. riveras life is quite controversial and to discredit him is the easiet form to invalidate his claims. out of evident knowledge dr. alberto was not anticatholic he only spoke what he lived. it would be quite contradicting to have been not only a roman catholic but a jesuite and then be margined as anticatholic. obviously this would be the best label in order for catholics to reject and discard whatever dr. rivera has said.,0

2185, can someone explain criticism to me? this is taken from the criticisms section of the article. since logic is inherently constant and that some things are more true than others it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. an example of a similar phenomenon is the gay marriage debate in the u.s. an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. can someone explain what exactly this means? i do not follow the first half of the paragraph the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me especially this part...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.i do not think thata the majority in question believes that it doesnt apply to them. though im not sure what it is in this context so the sentence may be true. the majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society which of course applies to everybody in that society.b the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views. its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed for the benefit of society it is aware of the effects and does not object to them. ,0

2213,banging your head against a wall hi i see jayjg has been leaving messages on your page with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness. in reality jayjg is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light. along with many of his cohorts.the problem is that jayjg is part of the wikipedia cabal. when there were elections despite massive efforts to the contrary a number of people got a higher vote percentage than jayjg but jimbo wales put him on arbcom anyhow. jimbo has shown his true colors as well.these people control wikipedia. they are all together and attacking you. no one is coming to your aid. this is because they control wikipedia with jimbo at the center and have more or less driven off everyone else. you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up disorted justified etc. anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here.my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative like a wiki encyclopedia that is not prozionist and antimuslim like this one. or if you do continue here for a little bit to spend less time. it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than . eventually you will give up here everyone does. you are fighting a losing battle.,0

2299,hello deacon thanks for the kind words. your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar? but theres no great preference here either way.oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the th century ... have a look at the skene reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way.it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony. northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly mercia and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones. im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons.the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article. regards ,0

2318,ivo banac...a bit of nonteleological historyone of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. for example if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. croatia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river a little bit to the east of the city of split. down the coast from the original croatia we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus the tenthcentury byzantine emperorhistorian called pagania literally land of the pagans zachlumia most of presentday eastern herzegovina with the croatian peninsula of peljesac terbounia the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina with dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs and dioclea the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of presentday albania around lake skadar/shkoder. serbia is located in the hinterland of zachlumia terbounia and dioclea its center around ras near todays novi pazar in the sandzak. bosnia was apparently within this territory but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river where we now find sarajevo and its environs. and dalmatia? in the tenthcentury this was a necklace of byzantineruled roman coastal cities and island territories from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south.moreover modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. thus unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnicas opposed to culturalcontinuity. the croat historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of dioclea a twelfthcentury text from bar in contemporary montenegro and its various translations for example marko marulic which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and dalmatian histories of mavro orbin and ivan lucic ioannes lucius . these works then became material for the croatianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic croatia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of ljudevit gaj and that of postrevival integral nationalists like ante starcevic . curiously the same histories orbins were serbianized through the translations of sava vladislavic which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of jovan rajic and were bulgarianized in the history of paisij hilandarski . the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more selfcontained. it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan notable selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia for example antun knezevic whose book was published between and .clearly something has happened in the span of ten centuries. pagania zachlumia and terbounia have disappeared. the center of croatia has migrated from the adriatic to the north into medieval slavonia literally slavic land with zagreb at its head. this happened in stages. during the high middle ages the heart of croatia was on the una river now in northwestern bosnia. this territory turkish croatia was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia. during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century the framework of modern croatia emerged in two extended shanksone to the north to modern slavonia the other in the south in modern dalmatia. at the same time the zagreb area which was only dubiously croatian in the early middle ages became the heart of modern croatia.the story of serbia is not much different. serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated dioclea. then it moved to the ibarmorava valleys then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia. it reached the danube only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. and its modern capital belgrade became truly serbian only in the course of karadjordjes uprising in . bosnia too expanded under ban or prorex kulin r. into the donji kraji literally lower lands around the vrbas river and the soli literally salt lands for centuries ottoman then modern tuzla and usora in its present northeastern corner. later on at the height of its power in fourteenth century bosnia expanded into hum herzegovina and the drina river valley. the westernmost regions were inc,0

2353,sure theyre subjective theyre rhetorical i was arguing a case. i still think that the single arrival point article to which all others direct should be the most neutral. i believe that that when dealing with periods in the past should be assumed to be the title used in the subjects own time necessarily adjusted for the english language in an e lang encyclopedia here philip the tetrarch. the herod philips have to be there because people will search for them. these pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time and then send the seeker to the historical name. if someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that theologians use ... and historians use ... that would be a welcome addition. this means that all the terms would be in wikipedia they would all be findable and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information and i trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. i dont want to move any pages just tidy up the way of finding them. i dont think this is as strong an advice as you do more of a signpost perhaps a better image than guide? in particular i was astonished when i began this by the confusion over hp i hp ii. evidence for the elder philip seems minimal.,0

2370,history of primal therapy articlei read through the recent discussions on talkprimaltherapy. i also added two more comments to the talkarthurjanov page. did you send an email enquiry? the date for france ds marriage to art is without credibility. after the divorce to vivians great credit she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov. after all he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated. chapter . and according to france d. janovs own admission in the primal centers video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. so its a fact that art married a former patient.my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. it isnt really the place to dissect janovs reputation. i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies but in many cases it has got out of hand. i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article. the conocer piece doesnt strike me as a sound source of verifiable information so i put together some links to articles which can be found onlineif you type emotional intelligence into google the no. result is steve heins website. he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janovs primal center in the late s. you can find his interview notes here labelled cautionary note.janovs bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr. janov’s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr. erik hoffman former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university. you can read what erik hoffmann ph.d. is doing now at hoffmanns website.on this page you can find a transcript of dr. e. michael holdens account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute.carol mithers book therapy gone mad identifies case histories from janovs first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy. simon thanks simon why cant you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page? i dont think the history idea will come to much there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingolds latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. i have already read the michael holden swan song twice sad case. you seem to be applying two standards of evidence. the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janovs books alone which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. last september i wrote in the primal therapy talk page will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbachers method or the international primal association or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the s? there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article for a start two books about the center for feeling therapy erik hoffmanns bio and the transcript of dr. e. michael holdens audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in . the books by carol mithers and tomas videgård are already referenced in the main article. i have a copy of videgårds book by the way. also professor steven rose wrote a onepage account of his research with arthur janov in lifelinesas janov had hoped it turned out that before therapy the quantity of these particular receptors in his clients platelets was considerably below normal. within six months of therapy clients depression had lifted and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for normal nondepressed people of the same age and sex.further down the same page he addedi obtained similar biochemical results when a couple of years later i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other less dramatic forms of psychotherapy so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.having participated in the editing of articles in t,0

2377, recap i decided to withhold further comment until i had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. i am delaying a trip this morning so that i can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.your supporting statement for deletion is as follows the result was delete. the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic and i have counted those opinions as being from userjulie dancer. kevin talk as for the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm... in reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance. within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by at that other algorithms exist namely examples of relevant works are a fast bottomup decision tree pruning algorithm with nearoptimal generalization and an efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees. which are capable of performing the function the article title namesif this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.in anticipation of these other algorithms being added i immediately changed the body of the text to read the algorithm used for this purpose... to one algorithm used for this purpose... since i do not now have access to the articles history as the result of your deletion i can not give you the exact date and time. however it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. incidentally it has been suggested by a professor at cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.normally as a wikipedia user i would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the wikipedia was setup this way. the wikipedia still claims to be ...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. the impression i have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. they simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. as for ...references not supporting the notability of the subject you can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. all of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which i deferred. just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. i know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.as for the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... this shows you did not read or comprehend the response i made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. i explained that each of the user names were created so that i could track the use of my own resources better similar to the need on the part of the wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots but currently i am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the wikipedia and mining it off line.since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w,0

2382, why will gwen gale not read the sources? on august i posted a section on talk death of adolf hitler titled “random questions” which started “i am not a scholar i read wiki but would not think of editing it. but i was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so i am asking some questions. perhaps someone else will read and address them.” the section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with “as to sources the last books i have read are the murder of adolph hitler by hugh thomas sort of shaky and the last days of hitler by anton joachimsthaler english translation i buy much of this.”gwen gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at she replied with ”as the article lead says...this said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. i say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought up...dodgy. gwen gale talk”by this reply it appears that gwen gale is not familiar with the work of joachimsthaler who i have just referenced and thinks that i am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one. at that time i apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions.at i posted” if i had read kershaws nemesis chapter note and epilogue note i wouldnt have wasted your time. you cant get much clearer than that. should be required reading. perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article. thank you for your time.... talk”at i posted “i would like to direct people to the work of ian kershaw hitler nemesis isbn . chapter and the epilogue relate to this article. please pay attention to his notes and sources. be warned his book hitler a biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....the source joachimsthaler is basically an english translation of a germans analysis of s postsoviet interviews of bunker survivors. the original transcripts must be available somewhere. there are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree. wm talk“since those posts i have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which gwen gale has disputed. much of the material i have posted i have later deleted often because i felt that the endless conflict between gwen gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. anyone who is wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. was i sometimes rude and argumentative? absolutely. was i making legitimate points which related to the article? i thought so. did i receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? i think not but you judge.my main point was that joachimsthaler had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which kershaw backed. i repeatedly begged anyone especially gwen gale to read joachimsthaler and kershaw specifically two footnotes i even told the pages of the footnotes. gwen gale clearly had not read either source. i posted under the heading “question for gwen gale” the following ”i lost you but i’m confused myself. it appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.my very low budget suburb is in a system which serves people with million titles numbers approximate thanks carol. kershaw joachimsthaler thomas trevorroper beevor shirer ryan toland eberle/uhl lehmann/carroll o’donnell victor petrova/watson. vinogradov hit a snag reordered. these are books which i have had in my possession and read parts of since aug . i can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but i think that should be addressed. if someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressed...i know that this is p.o.v. and that i am personally involved. but i can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s talkon gwen gale posted “for starters the russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule. gwen gale talk”. by this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either joachimsthaler or kershaw that gwen gale is still not familiar with either work. joachimsthaler was first referenced by me at august and kershaw was referenced by me at august and i believe that they were both on t,0

2410,i think it is both a khmer character and a tamil character then. the problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly but that it did not represent the sound w like the other characters in the logo. the khmer character does not represent w either. talk according to wikipediawikipedia logosalphabets represented in the logo they do represent the letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the english w as in wikipedia.however according to nohat at user talknohat/archive trouble in all the logos only some of the symbols were selected to represent wikipedia— others were chosen at random. and threads at user talknohat/archive say the same thing. angela says the same thing in metatalkmain page/archives//error in the wikipedia globe. zocky repeats it at talkmain page/archive wrong devnagari symbol for wi in wikipedias logo. the only remaining tiny flaw i can see in your logo thue is the topright piece klingon r is lacking any depth there should be a black edge to the piece but instead we see the grey of the inside. not very important at all though. ah i and the person who reported the problem with the tamil/khmer character thought that all the characters should represent w. but that is obviously not the case. imo the klingon r is within stylistic freedom so i guess the logo is correct now. when at first you dont succeed redefine success . talk acousmatic hi there you suggested a merger but you did not start a discussion i think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. instead i would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to acousmatic sound so that the page can function as a subsecion of acousmatic music which is a particular form of electroacoustic music one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. the acousmatic sound article might focus more on schaefers and chions theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context. ,0

2574, silesians andrew i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia. i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project. assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. i inquired about silesian/polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist. good luck with the article. olessi thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion. you are right that the work of a person is most important.however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace. if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up. to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist. i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition. seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german/silesian/polish guy. it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well. so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement.with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned. for some to hundred years there were under german governments. they had bad time as you possibly can imagine. many of them married with german and were/are of course confused who they are. you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued. finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. there in poland was complete disorder. soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way. “national” government just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. polish borders were shifted. we lost some % of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland. you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people. they spoke different polish dialect also. on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately i am. this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally. thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much. i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans.now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations.finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often naïve. not many realize that politic need caution. those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers. i am also convinced there exists something like national character. you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own.returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column on polish terytory in addition.sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich i still have with ge wiki. they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. that sucks.sorry and thanks again. feel free to contact me any time you need.best regards andrew december,0

2578,i have to laugh when watching the supposedly british national news with guys barely up to their ankles in snow implying that ragnarok is upon us yet on the same day when trees are being blown down and main roads being blocked by snow in scotland it doesnt seem to be noteworthy. scotland routinely gets ignored on the national news and even people from the north of england were complaining about the fuss made by the southern oriented news. tourists appear to be amazed that things are falling apart because of something like this. my mother had a very good giggle at the reporters live in trafalgar square in a couple of inches of snow or beside a main road barely ankle deep.... lance tyrell,0

2591,article revised for flow and minor correctionsi have made a start on editing the article’s minor errors of grammar syntax and flow. i hope this is acceptable to the other editors who have already done such a good job here. although i have changed the order of some of the information trying to lead from the general to the particular i have not removed any so far as i am aware. i have added some details about the attack on the cornerstone ceremony. i have also revised the numbers of aggressors and victims in this attack in line with those in the existing cited sources. i’m not sure where the article’s original figure of serbs came from. have i overlooked a reference? if so i apologize and ask that it be restored. anyway this change may well be temporary if someone can find other equally or more reliable souces.if the established editors here are unhappy with what ive done please feel free to revert.i think the article could use quite a few more cites.,0

2707,the marvels and mysteries of cite web hei sorry i didn’t respond earlier. was through all the material on using and the time got away. only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet herr professor omberg for breakfast and then on to do what must be done for the day. but now that there is time to write this is what i understand using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent and apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into webcite to request a permanent archive. somehow – should the link rot as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from webcite and repoint the reference so it is still live if this is a correct understanding then using is a virtuous thing to do and i will do it. for this insight thank you skål ,0

2728,the fact that azeris are mixed turkic speaking people that sprung from the turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear. they were and are in the location that was arran that consistent of albanians and iranian tribes. furthermore the fact that the entire area was called arran then for some reason was renamed azerbaijan is another indication that azeris were not a turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the caucus next to the sakas. no one said azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other iranians in fact iranians are a multiethnic multi lingual group much like the kurds in the west have a different language/customs as do balochies in the south. what happened to iranians in arran intermittingly in which the turks invaded their tribes and the albanians were driven out and imposed their language on them via elite dominance does not change their original ancestry. you have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the azeris came from why they even appear/are part of iran even today and why these ethnic groups even have a persian culture? in all you can concentrate on their differences but fail to explain where did azeris come from? it is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts and write pages of texts about germanic peoples in an article about iranian peoples. i think i’ll stop at that.,0

2822,hi i just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. i think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. also none of the information under applications is cited. if this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. under references reference list is misspelled. also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. if you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. the analogies in the hologram and holonomy under theory overview was very helpful to understand the concept. ,0

2867,i think theres little doubt that there is taking in both directions here. more than likely the world golf hall of fame used the wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website. unless the earlier wikipedia article copied from another source which they later also used. she was inducted into the world golf hall of fame in and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point. but the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in this evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in august it was sources probably circularly to the wghof and the snippet of their text pasted in.meanwhile not all but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with wpcopypaste. for now ill clumsily address it with quotation marks. talk,0

2901,so i hope you will oppose any version of fr that would not have prevented this case as not being fit for purpose. in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have % prevented the ted kennedy incident.i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all. i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare. why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? and any interested observers please stop before you say it these valid concerns with what fr is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant advantage of fr of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles.and to further address the specific example you give maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim when it was added to the article along with another sentences which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax and at worst screams delete me now for being total wpbollocks. we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is % complete bollocks? even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. a systemic failure perhaps?and finally as an admin perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now blocked irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. incidentally the now famous bad account on ted kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article. another systemic failure?im all for criticla analysis of cases fr would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer about the whole model of wikipedia never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations. ,0

2936,pretty much what i said the first day this was posted. now i have neither a problem with the cabals decision nor in the cabals logic as deamon does. my concern is why a vote that basically said i dont know means it stays at burma. by the cabals conclusion...if the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation and we had the same cabal it would now be a myanmar article. i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy. however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision? you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma. husond is right where does this end? when i first looked at this mess i said and posted that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. there are good points for each argument. im in the burma camp but that is how i see things. so im looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. choice just doesnt look that appealing. ,0

3004, narciso yepes please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. yepes collaborated with ramirez not bernabe to invent his guitar. bernabe an apprentice of ramirez later formed his own shop and yepes subsequently played a bernabe string. as for your comment about yepess hands this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of yepes. i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available depending on what best served the music. do you have these proofs??? no. so please stick to what you actually know. fyi yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first strings d together with the low g on the th string by using the left hand thumb. again we have the proof of this. it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... your discussion at narciso yepes first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for yepess death. and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious...second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and yepes invented his tenstring guitar. as i said bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then but the first yepestype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar. moreover ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar. this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical. it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings. you want a verifiable source? here ramirez iii jose. . the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar. bold strummer. pp. . isbn third i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar. furthermore yepes frequently uses the th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor th higher than the th string. moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions. being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepess entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. this has nothing to do with yepess own performance practice on his instrument. as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepess leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about. yepes even frets a and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing.,0

3011,i disagree. the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if cameron were to die/resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt. clegg may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.,0

3060, removed pov i removed undo criticism of secretary boutwell and pov. wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. the following has been removed from the article.boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation. intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. he believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception henry adams wrote in a muchquoted analysis in . he believed in common schools and not in political science in ledgers and cashbooks but not in adam smith or mill as one might believe in the multiplicationtable but not in laplace or newton. by a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.henry adams the session north american review july p. . but in a very corrupt time it spoke well of boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his cabinet post either for himself or his friends. living within his salary he lodged in a boardinghouse throughout his tenure. his only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money. chicago times march . he is an inaccessible man uninfluenced by fear favor affection or hope of reward and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred a new england politician wrote his brother. henry f. french to benjamin b. french march benjamin b. french papers library of congress.boutwells financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments but while boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of washington remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.,0

3068,featuring your work on wikipedias front page dyks thank you for your recent articles including partita penderecki which i read with interest. when you create an extensive and well referenced article you may want to have it featured on wikipedias main page in the did you know section. articles included there will be read by thousands of our viewers. to do so add your article to the list at ttdyk. let me know if you need help reply here wikiproject assessment tags for talk pages thank you for your recent articles including partita penderecki which i read with interest. when you create a new article can you add the wikiproject assessment templates to the talk of that article? see the talk page of the article i mentioned for an example of what i mean. usually it is very simple you just add something like {{wikiproject keyword}} to the articles talk with keyword replaced by the associated wikiproject ex. if its a biography article you would use wikiproject biography if its a united states article you would use wikiproject united states and so on. you do not have to rate the article if you do not want to others will do it eventually. those templates are very useful as they bring the articles to a wikiproject attention and allow them to start tracking the articles through wikipediaarticle alerts and other tools. this can help you too as the wikiproject members will often defend your work from deletion and try to improve it further. feel free to ask me any questions if youd like more information. reply here ,0
3069,good information going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible should we then create a different article for the gong baotian and xie pieqi styles? rather than dilute the style information of each style my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm. perhaps one called xie pieqi line yin style baguazhang and another gong baotian line yin style baguazhang. for each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources splits from the main article seem to make sense to me.,0

3074, the less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is british irish isles. believe when i say that the manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the u.k. as a protected and supported territory republic of ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the u.k.did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the british isles. place names reflect current realities thus we have istanbul and not constantinople. a better example would be the aegean coast of turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the greek coast and all the islands were greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the turkish state has jurisdiction the only islands which are now greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of greece. if you were to rebut by saying that british refers to something more than a political term but rather than an ethnic or geographical one then the same argument or even a better one can be made of greek. the greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient greece e.g. southern italy sicily turkey armenia etc and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated greek are ethnically and linguistically greek but live in the state of turkey and therefore the islands and coast are turkish. thus you could not refer to the island of ireland as british.,0

3105,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized. however the term fossilized is not a very precise term. there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil. one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc. and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc. talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned.the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in? experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue. the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains. flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working. much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains. yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.,0

3113,well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wpdbad here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here i mean the talkinternational recognition of kosovo page. as far as the wprm if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure im still not sure that there is one. moreover im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed. persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wparbmac probation this article is under the scope of. concerning the closure of proposal. im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wprm. actually i find wprm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wprm but then i might misunderstood something. i might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter. hus as a formalist as i consider you at the moment i must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. i suppose i pointed out one might consider ive used irony i apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least. maybe some other place exists which im not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself. not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action ? / . sorry for that.ijanderson you asked why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia? well actually i do consider this title is biased also. but personally i consider the irok more globally important not just to me as one might think it is. if the bias is dealt with this issue irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also. and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place > maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea.all the best. s talk ,0

3262,is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent? dont answer the questions beyond thatwell the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here. first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean really. second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand. id is just making up their numbers. finally your example has a>b where b was deliberate design. thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown. your a>b example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him. you dont have that with life on earth. you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test. so in that sense a>b is not scientific if youve never actually observed b. btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed. so in that sense no it isnt science. ,0

3282,edits by keraunoshi keraunos. i see you added to and rearranged some of this article. i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. but actually that isnt physically accurate. the universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy. where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear i.e. the universes taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. hence i went ahead and cut this edit of yours.if people read further into the body of the article under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free. you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.i kept the ressurection link. i understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar. the term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means. you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to tipler will occur between x ^ and x ^ years from now in proper time.one should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of artificial intelligence ai as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate. hence im changing this to from that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term.i also removed your quote of tiplers estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his book the physics of immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on. so tiplers current estimation is different now. for more on that seef. j. tipler the structure of the world from pure numbers reports on progress in physics vol. no. april pp. . see also here. also released as feynmanweinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything arxiv. april . you added the section criticism from string theory.i kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. i changed the section title to implications from string theory since brian greene doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to tiplers omega point theory in greenes book that you referenced.this section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under wikipedias rule concerning original research. as its written its a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction. you moved the see also section to underneath the references. you also added a number of links therein.based upon wikipedias featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously before the references. hence i moved it back. i removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce,0

3367,it should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including muay thaiwhich mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper bodyboxing as it is calledand many other martial art techniques not exclusive to maui boran or maui tha etc... women are not considered true martial artists anyway. that is because the arts are designed used mastered and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. a womans training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. this is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. it is sad what has happened to karate and tkd in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practionersby way of parents unconditioned elders and women. but that is another debate. regardless female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. like it or not gender is of the physical mental and in my opinion the spiritual as well. play to its strengths not its weaknesses. it is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.,0

3390,responses i was not referring to this only your posts on wikipediocracy recently. i was not referring to these events dating back to it does not appear relevant to your actions now. i am sure people can refer to the arbcom case for the facts if they wish. i did review the situation with a sitting arbcom member before starting rfa as you are aware. this is the first time i have heard about it. it seems a bit late to be digging this up now. i know nothing about this your page was not even on my watchlist until today. no i was not even aware of revenge nominations. if i ever commented in a dr related to this it was not as part of any pattern and i do not recall ever doing so. i do not watch everything you do on commons nor did i watch everything russavia did. i am not russavia nor do i take responsibility for his actions. if you wish to have my help on commons please leave me a note there. i briefly looked at s contributions to assess if he was active as an otrs volunteer on commons. the copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes shocking for an otrs volunteer granting verification tickets to images. this was selfevident even looking at the first thumbnails some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review it is not like i was deleting them on sight i am leaving the review to others. if you wish to discuss ktrs uploads to commons i suggest that happens on commons.your responses appear to avoid the central issue which is how you are now using wikipediocracy to hound me. you appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. if you have allegations to make please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then i can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.again you are digging through history some of which is years old and the most recent is now years old. it would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud most of which i have forgotten as i have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.thanks ,0
3391,im sorry you are wrong on both counts. northumbrian is a different dialect to geordie as you have said. the other dialects from the area are makem and pitmatic. northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of northumberland. i being from northumberland myself actually know what i am talking about. if you live in rural northumberland bearing in mind that the shire as northumberland is a shire county is mostly rural you would have a different dialect to someone from newcastle prudhoe or gateshead as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a geordie accent. also no serious linguist would call all these different dialects geordie. i have heard them grouped as northumbrian dialects but not geordie dialects. calling them northumbrian is correct for two reasons one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as northumbria that is northumberland durham newcastle...etc...on the other point you are mistake. england though not the whole uk can be rightly called a germanic nation. it is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say though it is connected in some ways however traditions language laws and history are england was of course founded by...you guessed it germanic tribes whether they are the predominant dna is besides the point. these tribes were the angles saxons jutes and frisians. you cant deny this as before the english kingdoms england did not exist. our language is obviously germanic though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries it is still west germanic. most of our common traditions such as yule yule itself is a germanic word derived from the norse jul are germanic the eating of a christmas ham mistletoe christmas trees yule logs...etcare all germanic. many of our laws come direct from anglosaxon and danish laws though i agree many were modified by the normans who though descended from norwegians are not culturally germanic.as for selfidentity i would say that the english identify themselves with germanic culture albeit in a subliminal way for example the fact that they use anglosaxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. they are identifying with tribes that were danish and northern german and thus germanic so on that score yes the english are a germanic people.and as you bring up dna casually then firstly i will point out that it isnt proven either way whether the anglosaxon dna is more prominent or whether the british used in this sense as preanglosaxon is. different surveys have different results and none have actually been accepted by all experts. and for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the north east of england the germanic percentage is higher than the british thus the predominant dna is germanic the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is anglosaxon or danish viking blood but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is germanic. i dont care whether the modern english have british or anglosaxon blood as i am partly norsegaelic and partly english...thus being a mix. i just do think that the anglosaxon blood is prominent as do many experts in north eastern england.either way germanic blood or british blood...the english are ethnically germanic.note i am not going to lie and say i am not proud of germanic culture as it is obvious especially by my username but i do consider myself british as the uk isnt about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and i am proud of that also. and by the way there is a good case for northumbria being one of the more germanic parts due in a large part to its folklore especially its creatures that include dvergar which they are actually called...they are dwarves and álfar or more correctly ælfe as they are in old english who are known by the common english word elf but are the older and if i may say more correct type. ,0

3398,speedy deletion of phi rho eta a tag has been placed on phi rho eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. for legal reasons we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material and as a consequence your addition will most likely be deleted. you may use external websites as a source of information but not as a source of sentences. this part is crucial say it in your own words.if the external website belongs to you and you want to allow wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement i name am the author of this article article name and i release its content under the terms of the gnu free documentation license version . and later. you might want to look at wikipedias policies and guidelines for more details or ask a question here. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0

3421,no i will make sure that will be removed permanently. i will not do this for awhile to avoid violations but hope that someone else will consider and agree. there is no reason whatsoever to put the late in front of his name i will list several reasons and although i think that is somewhat pov there are other reason as to why i remove the infoeveryone dies sometime does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put the late in front of everyone that has died?poor writing its just sloppy/filler writing to put the late in place. would you ever see anyone referred to as the late in a print encyclopedia?recentism wp has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective. would it make sense years down the road to still refer to him as the late? lets make things as static as possible.precedent at one point several dozen articles referred to steve irwin as the late steve irwin now this is the only one that does by doing a search and there seems to be consensus about that.knowledge of his death lets face it a vast majority of people especially those that would look for this article know he is dead and the few that may not be sure can click the link. maybe people dont want to know that hes dead or be reminded of it and putting that acts as a spoiler. even anna nicole smith had a few the lates put on pages of hers and those have all been removed a few by me a few by others. saving a click is not a valid reason for this we should assume that the readers are smart and things like that can go to the simple english edition.irrelevance why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming? his shows will probably be reran for many years to come and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.well this is my case i would also like to point out wpown which i feel has been violated in these reverts. i also am starting a discussion on wpwords to avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that i am doing the right thing. i am supremely confident that i am and i look forward to improving the peta article in the future. ,0

3442,ok obiwan. youre starting to make me suspicious. what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions? own up. either way you did not answer my question directly and i also suspect you know it. does this mean that wpo is not useful to you? but you did answer it indirectly. so you get an even more direct question in return why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? for one you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. if you dont mind im going to take this straight to the source wpo peeps what the dealio? ive asked people on wp to put up or shut up. ive asked the wmf to walk their talk. in fact ive staked my rep several times now and im not done yet. now im asking you why dont you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? onwiki or off obiwan certainly isnt the first to question your selfrighteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia. i for one have been wondering for a while now. so lets see what you can do besides making snarky personal comments. heres a pot and heres a kettle. need i mention what color they are?onwards with obiwans points. i dont believe in nasty people. deciding anyone is bad nasty etc. has only one purpose one can feel better about being bad nasty etc. to people theyve so judged. i dont think this is particularly productive. in fact imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides or more often others have convinced them that they themselves are bad people. we could talk about this more in another thread but weve got to get back on topic here so. . . you know that the wikipediocrats are smart. you have spent more time there than youre willing to admit directly. i immediately wonder if its just in reading or in writing too. they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoningwise that ive met so far. but emotionally. . . less than average. how do you think many of these smart mer fers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? a lot of them fell from grace not because they werent an asset to the community but because they didnt seem to know when or they were completely unwilling to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. thats one part of the answer many of them are banned or blocked whether rightly so or not from editing on wikipedia. also its normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. youll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. frankly we could speculate about these peoples motives and methods til the sun goes down. lets be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here. what we as a wikipedia community cant do is ignore them away. and even if we could were doing a pisspoor job of it because i almost always hear about whats been said on wikipediocracy from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site. ultimately i go back to my old standard i dont give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are alls i know is that they are saying something interesting and i appreciate the fact that i dont have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it. obiwan no use playing coy. you know exactly what im talking about. d ,0

3452,==street gang==mr. davisthanks for your note on my talk page i really appreciate it and its an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book. as this articles creator and main editor im sorry that you thought the review section was so negative. please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book. in my rush to get the article published i did a google search and those are the reviews i found. also please understand that this is a wikipedia article and the article as it now stands will never be complete. its a work in progress. i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there. i am by no means a professional writer so im certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors. i wouldve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work. i appreciate your feedback something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor. if you are aware of other sources that i wasnt able to locate please send them my way on my talk page. ill repeat this message via your webpage to ensure that you see it.you should also know that ive taken it upon myself to improve all sesame streetrelated articles on wikipedia. its a big project and a great need. for example sesame street at one point was actually a featured article but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons. its an unfortunate state at the current time. your book came out shortly after i took on the project so its been a boom for me. i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start so your book has been a valuable resource. ive already started working on this article history of sesame street and if you look at the reference section youll see that ive used your book extensively. its also a work in progess and no where near finished. my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame streets th anniversary in november. i cant tell you how much your book has helped me.on a personal level i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book. it was a fun read and immensely interesting. i was brought to tears many times especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air. see im turning this year which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it. i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized they did all that for me i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly and now the life of my own children who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do. i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia and ive taken it upon myself to help accomplish that. if you as the ultimate expert could assist me in that goal i cant tell you how valuable that would be. again thanks for the feedback and communication. ,0

3508, may utcprince felix of schwarzenburg is at the right location. his uncle and then his cousin was the fürst while felixs position all of his life was that of a prinz this distinction is tougher for families where all used fürst like wrede and also titles like herzog and graf but it is easily determined. i am as certain as you are about alfred iii because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals other than the heinrichs reuss were the heads of houses and families. friedrich johannes jacob celestin von schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway he was zu not von. he was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also the prince john adolph ii. i dont mind leaving the german von or zu for princes of territories if the title isnt used. for instance felix zu schwarzenburg and prince felix of schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. adolph von auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source i have gives adolphs title as fürst which wouldnt make sense. i would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. prince karl of auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the fürst but again i would ask on the page. charles ,0

3644, tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and u.s. jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. i appreciate that the situation in the u.s. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech. to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city. in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas. saying that dla has has offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china ... would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research. i do accept that dla with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible. ,0

3661,a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies phylogenies i.e. dictomously branching processes are processes that involve things that is objects and as such have to be modeled by objectoriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria. now as an objectoriented model the model actually represents two consecutive objects i.e. two objects in a row by each of its internal lines i.e. lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node the former belonging to the category i.e. concept objects after nodes and the latter to the category objects before nodes. if the model includes all objects of a certain category then both of these make up this category. in summary phylogenies consist of two categories i.e. concepts of objects objects before nodes and objects after nodes and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category then these two categories make up this category.cladistics or cladism as i prefer to call it confuses the concept objects after nodes with the concept objects before nodes by defining lines between nodes as single things thereby confusing category with object that is kind with thing thus confusing conceptualization itself. the approach is actually a return to a prescientific stage this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. if this approach could ever be proved to be correct then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. luckily einsteins discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach i.e. claim and this it did even before the approach was born. cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged. consist presently at ... ,0

3685,changes to this page open discussion ==since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a démenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris. i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors. i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page. i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there. this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved.the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page. the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window. the same for paris history or paris fashion. here i am but repeating what i have already written below.in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages. my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own. this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity. my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own. just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have. with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt. in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary. please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all. addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here > please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out== ,0

3687, mediawikiduplicatedefaultsort do you realize what a wonderful thing this is? when you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created? i hope not because i have been although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under s and t while i finish l and do m through r i will not complain.when i stumbled across the category there were pages in it. by the end of today there will be fewer than . my goal is to get all the nontrivial items resolved by the end of next week so i can start on the pages in categorybiography articles without listas parameter a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life. because i am resolving the conflicts in the first category i have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks like you who know why the banners work as they do. i have also leaned what items can set the defaultsort. as an added bonus i have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts i did not know before and i have become almost addicted to preview.the absolutely best part about the dupds is that the category it has created that i will continue to monitor on a daily basis is a safety net for me when i mess something up on a page in categorybiography articles without listas parameter. the easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it wants it and will throw a fit if it is not there.thank you ,0

3728, suggestions to improve readability hi guys the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read at least thats what i read in the reader comments. i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing. before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money explain the intent of the system missing right now. sthg like it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party that can dictate credit worthiness or price of transactions as in banks or paypal etc.then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description ive read is when a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. bitcoin miners scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger. by morgen peck in ieee spectrum feb a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. another faq from a washington post blog is here and an article days ago about the death of the mt. gox bitcoin exchange by morgen peck was on science friday today is herebitcoin was also discussed on point last november in conjunction with the senate committee hearing about it. ,0

3744,midwest accenti see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the general american accent in the article midwest which quite wrongly implies that general american is owned lock stock and barrel by that region. its nonsense. the general american accent is spoken all over the north from seattle to connecticut. you are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the midwest before ikk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. it certainly is not unique to the midwest a region which was not even settled by english speakers until barely years ago after the northern accent was known to exist in places like pennsylvania and upstate ny and connecticut. it really bugs me to see the midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the northeast. the original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. anybody from my region the syracuse ny area formerly albany ny knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the midwest. i challange anybody to put a group of midwestern speakers sidebyside with upstate new yorkers and tell which is which. its impossible its the same accent utterly and completely the same. and weve been speaking this way since before the midwest was even settled so its nonsense to say its a midwest accent.,0

3814, well have a look at this photo especially what the grabber is doing with his hands its very plausible and highly likely that there were scratches. i use grabber guardedly since a person who by force of arms takes and carries away is a robber at least here under the common law so a more accurate description would be attempted robber. as for your argument about idiocy... thats like saying rape victims are at fault by wearing skimpy dresses. whats wrong is wrong is wrong and using violence against an innocent civilian to promote a political agenda is wrong and you cannot justify it by the tenuously connected actions of another. talk ,0

3819, utcas a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers. swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here. i can well understand how fennoswedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin. august ,0
3820, hie dvdm. i was writing what follows while you made your edit. i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example.thanks johnuniq for your advice and input. concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s early s. adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats. but thats not the really important issue here. the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there. btw in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out. at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved. there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for. cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place. throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute. so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length. ,0
3821,i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth’s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. i think that the img reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty. i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teethbut bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article. i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by offriorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth’s biography. perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which i suspect should not be difficult—that it can be reincluded? i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment. actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle. ,0

3846,to cool hand luke i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. from the wikipedia deletion guidelinesdeletion process main article wikipediadeletion policydeletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes. . another quick method is the use of proposed deletion simply add to the top of the article. this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the tag within five days and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required.i thought i complied with this policy it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag. it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. beyond meeting the criterias specifics the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia and that the proposal to delete along with the reasons given which i believe are not in good faith therefore violates various wikipedia policies.the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the users prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of as demonstrated by his reasons or comments to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object wikipedia is not a full time job for most users who only visit the site from time to time and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass redirected the article to another article effectively deleting the original article. in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay and when i hit save the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings in bad faith for what i believe were good faith acts on my part and had me blocked before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.it seems quite clear in light of the above and further facts that can be marshalled in support that this users intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy.recognizing this i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform. i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not as the user had made the dispute personal.as for my being blocked by you as per the revert rule i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a users his apparent violations rather than reply he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times in violation of the rule in bad faith turned the rule on mei did not delete anything and technically i did not revert anything either i think but was adding to previous posts and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post.other indications of bad faiththe user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonics rendezvous band by removing the delete tags. my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove,0

3908,regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada my reading of his csr transcript is exactly the opposite. he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five stolen? canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan.regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to khaldan for years? i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team. but if the camp had been a college i think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer. a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted. az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training. and once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones. he had helped grads slip into bosnia during the civil war there. i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp. his location was a secret for four years. he was found in a libyan prinson in april by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him. and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide. i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version his pretorture versions of what the camp did.,0

3911,your source states about the black–white difference in iq which at the time was about points the neisser et al. article stated there is not much direct evidence on this point but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis. that conclusion stands today there has been no new direct evidence on the question. see rushton jensen a b gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black–white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.please stop lying. ... then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no. do you see the problem here? ... question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view? the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars. yes. ... question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist? the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology. the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article. no. nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having virtually no chance of being true by a reliable tertiary source. ... ,0

4163,in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims. it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp. the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue. this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.,0

4173,records of awesome editors who truly want to help==as this is not a study of peoples hesitancy it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for peoples hesitancy. it would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. if this study is the reason for peoples hesitancy then we should be pointing to a reliable thirdparty source that states that its the reason not to the study itself. if we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film jaws we use as a reference the source that makes that statement not the film itself. so no its not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. nat gertler talk that has got to be the clearest explanation yet. so what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality then cite both sources? or should i use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. is this where wiki gets the facts from opinions then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is wpor? it is built by popular opinion of the editors from opinion pieces not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though i hope notdcrsmama talk no im not saying cite both sources. references are there to verify the facts that are being stated in wikipedias voice. if the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy there is no need to cite the study. even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study we might mention this study in the text but the study itself is not reference for the statement. and i am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. if you have concerns about the other sources in the article you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. nat gertler talk from wprps==,0

4194,marnanel your talking nonsense there is no dispute in the real world.money magazine wrote that article after complaints were made is now out dated. stevensons legal battles have been settled for some time. all the text vary from each other which is reflected on the page. there is no dispute between powers and myself. her attorneys were contacted and since then her products have reverted to her particular text only. the problem was these people thought they could cheat me and they got caught. now they have suffered terrible embarassment over it. the matter has been resolved and i am not willing to sacrifice my legacy with the public hog washing these stories. enough is enough. money magazine never interviewed one single author for that story. my legacy does not revolve around money magazine but my authorship. and if you want to present the footprints poem in the wikiyou must show the chronology of the poems history. what is it that you need to present reliable source to this article?be specific. i removed my published book from world wide marketingis that enough proof of authorship for you. if so then see authorhouse for details or contact me. thank you carolyn joyce carty,0

4196,further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede . since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards. sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it. ,0

4205,dect isnt really a new technology. its a newer standard but tdm/tdma/fdma digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of dect. dect is itself a successor to ct japans phs is very similar and of course gsm damps and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. to suggest there are special health issues with dect would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. dect is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces both during transmissions and inherently because even when in use the td nature of the system means the system isnt transmitting continuously.as i believe ive said before there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of lowpower radio technology and there being a link in the see also section of this article to it. that article of course should look nothing like the section i yanked. there is nothing about dect however that merits a special section on dects dangers especially when new technology or otherwise there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.,0

4284,relevance? in a new zealand tv series presented by rebecca gibney called sensing murder which aired on tvnz beginning in three psychic mediums from australia and new zealand sue nicholson kelvin cruickshank and deb webber armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. the team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains. skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources and it was further satirized in the season finale where host jeremy wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.just how relevant is this? granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show. we are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. if high profile mediums were used i would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.cheers,0

4306,its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement. there was a recent newspiece a quote by putin times of israel putin first soviet government was mostly jewish. apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact. in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article.,0

4324, section needs to be edited this line about new hampshire is not very accurateon january for the first time martin luther king day was officially observed in all states. prior to that new hampshire and arizona did not observe the day.in fact new hampshire passed civil rights day in to honor dr king and other civil rights activists like rosa parks and malcolm x. since the article states clearly that other states such as utah have different names for the holiday including combining it with confederate military heroes this sentence does not seem justifiable. the article leaves the impression that new hampshire was some sort of bigoted state that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.i am a newbie to wikipedia how do we fix this?,0

4331,i know derex very well. he has been stalking me ever since i wrote the campaign finance article months ago. i tell him if he finds anything incorrect in what i write to help himself and fix it but he then ignores me and i find comments of his later on talk pages with vailed insults about spamming pages and calling me a zealot. he is clearly a stealth idealogue who has no intention of making constructive edits. his only goal appears to be stalking other constructive editors.as for your statement that i am placing a relatively long fundraising scandal section into this article hogwash. a short two sentence paragraph with a link to the main article is not a long section. wikipedia rules clearly state we are to link relevant articles to eachother. as the dnc was fined for illegal fundraising and many of its fundraiser were convicted of crimes this page is the most relevant page to link my article to. an article by the way that has featured status and has been showcased on wikipedias main page. i am putting the info back into the article where it belongs. i am not waiting months for some imaginary discussion to take place here. no one reads talk pages and the few that would actually stop by will be partisans. if you continue to delete factual referenced history from this article i will report you to the moderators. good day ,0
4332,from my standpoint you are the confused. im looking at it in the rd person. what the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. fact is that the britons were in an antiangles coalition and the angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. if the britons had contact to the former roman empire is unclear but possible. they lived under roman rule for centuries and were romanized. this defeat was something like deromanizing to them after years of roman rule. this can clearly be seen when you read and understand the roman britainanglosaxon battles in germanic wars.,0

4586,criticism > the oohashi et al. results reveal some interesting contradictions. while full bandwidth sound was preferred to cd limited bandwidth over a speaker the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. additionally the preference for hfc was not replicated when using headphones only with speaker presentation ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. these are not contradictions. they are an essential feature of the study specified and discussed in the paper. there is no contradiction here. out it goes. contrary evidence and abx tests oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. abx tests only tell what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. if same research methods had been used and results were drastically different that should be called contradictory. i will state that even more generally than previous there are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to but nevertheless they affect humans wellbeing and happiness. for example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. we just dont know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. some signals could be processed half consciously in humans brains one feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.,0

4609,yes i do realize a lot of people made contributions to the article when i approached it. this is why i made a lot of effort to get other opinions on the rewrite and what the article should cover. see talksexrewrite of article wikipedia talkwikiproject sexology and sexuality wikipedia talkwikiproject biologysex and wikipedia talkversion. editorial team/core topicssex. no secret has been made of this rewrite—you can see how difficult it has been to get feedback. this article obviously had no steward as you so aptly describe on your userpage. i chose to become that steward when i proposed and made the rewrite. i would eventually like to take this core article to fa and its been difficult to get any feedback.perhaps you didnt realize it but a see also section is deprecated material should be covered within the body of the article. this came up during the genetics fac. im sorry your link got removed i thought i had covered everything in the article. as i noted on the talk page i think the article should have a top level section on evolution and i think this link could eventually go in there.i like you. im surprised hurt and disappointed that youre so quick to be angry with me. in my past experience and up to now with the sex article ive been too hesitant to throw away old material and too slow to rewrite. because i got no response to my proposal and because the article was so poorly written i went ahead and did it. wikipedia encourages us to be bold. who works on gender seemed happy with it. ✉ ✍ ,0

4611,the table of sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the three sacks in order to raise the yamiking and likewise hydrate to the surface. typically a being from the reverse maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions we see when crimson love and the sacks return to the dark world they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface. my assumption is that an object such as the yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use. thus the table of sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals in the form of a clock to power the yamiking. after the sacks summon the clock crimson and love throw over defeated opponents already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff into each number with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the yamiking. ,0

4645,so far nobodys reverted me so that gives me hope. meantime let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. in recent years wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers clients and others considering doing business with someone. naturally the one doing the vetting has the lions share of responsibility in judging an entrys reliability and supplementing it with other research. that said do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents as far as possible an accurate wellrounded picture of the subject? in the case of ms. caesar i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny. what are your thoughts? ,0

4710,firstly some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts? also the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said. perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant. perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily. i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia but i also exploited loop holes in the rules. so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning. and im so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page. you asked that we do something i.e. explain the significance of the clan etc and we did but you deleted it anyway. and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us. also one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that? if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth? also if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right? if you say no then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit. before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. ,0

4728,first of all i have told to many pages from the first day that the account is coming from an office that giorgos works and that is giorgos that told me of what is going on here in relation with the discrimination personal attacks enforcement of an anticypriot propaganda deleting all edits that do not follow this anticypriot propaganda despite their well sourced evidence the double standards in blocking the blocking of anyone that is basically not following a specific anticypriot agenda on the matters of cyprus after a war edit by a specific team the same team that is trying to enforce its own agenda on cyprus matters and trying to block anyone else from editing propaganda tactics e.t.c. everything has to do with a discrimination the effort to dictate personal attacks and the effort to enforce an anticypriot propaganda on cyprus. second giorgos is not writing in wikipedia anymore so he has no active account. third as i see all the things that giorgos is saying are true. you can block the account and you can block it forever if you please i will take the matter to the highest levels and we will speak from there. i will give all the names and all the evidence necessary and i if i dont see anything happening you will see all the users involved in this in popular newspapers and newsportals and often explaining exactly what happened what is happening and what is going on with evidence. evidence matters to the rest of the world in contrast with here.,0

4821,ok ill try to sort through your latest post here. let me know if i misinterpret something.first you specify a theory axiomatic system namely zfcp+ppomega exists. lets call that t for easy reference.now you argue that t proves the existence of a model lets call it m the because its not a model of t but of a new theory such thatm satisfies zfcppomega is in m. now do you mean the real pomega or do you mean that m satisfies pomega exists that is that theres an element of m that m thinks is pomega? im guessing the latter that m satisfies pomega exists.you say aleph is in the model and is less than or equal to the cardinality of pomega. again im guessing you mean that this is in the models opinion that is m satisfies the statement exists and .ok so going with my guesses thus far i agree that t proves the existence of such an m. m might be for example mg where m equals which is a model for t and g is mgeneric for the partial order to add cohen reals.,0

4891,my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. that was like the nd day almost two months ago.all of my references are nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation. i didnt put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge.i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. for instance i wrote to the aba and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article. i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view. those references were deleted by someone i cant remember who and dont know why. at this point the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid transcript. the guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers. even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for. i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.i dont believe that i did any original research. all i did is search the internet for references for the article. i really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article. i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf which date back to . also when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst.i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway. same as the u.n. covenantcant really hide that. i didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously. like today i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which i think is because of judge learned hand who was in the fifth circuit. and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se no there was not. what i found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly.i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing. i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. ive been an entrepreneur. i didnt know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article. that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article. the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article.arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself. one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i havent got it yet. but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state slave state border state. also there were issues related to indians in some of the western states. the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too i think. so did the history of workmens comp which is of course related to unions. ,0

4893,well i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article. it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress. i have two problems first it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in to science as a specifically western project. second although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge the history of science is rather more complicated than that.one way to deal with this if others find my criticisms valid is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck etc on the one hand and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other. for example i think everyone agrees that aristotle newton einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims. id hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of say thomas kuhn and bruno latour could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously as well as the claims of those with opposing views.i am glad ed has begun this article it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. sr,0

4911,quoting hoppe first detailing kinsellas important pointsat this diff i put in the democracy section hoppes earlier comment first and followed with more about what kinsella said i.e.stephan kinsella writes that hoppes critics have accused hoppe of homophobia bigotry and the like based on these passages. kinsella wrote that that hoppes discussion of physically removing homosexuals and other groups only applied to private covenantbased communities centered around traditional values. he shared a letter hope wrote to him saying the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society.as i said in my edit summary just because some choose to totally take his comments about of context and attack him does not mean that wikipedia should be used for the same purpose. talkie talkie🗽 ,0

5032,==another specific example====under genetic explanations wrn has written this to support these claims they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in iq . black–white–east asian differences in iq reaction time and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. in the united states significant blackwhite iq differences are observable at every age above years within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested in every region of the country and at every time since the invention of ability tests. . jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different iq subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability. from these and other findings they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis. . the rising heritability of iq with age within all races studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at % in infants rises to % in middle childhood and peaks at % in adulthood and studies showing the virtual disappearance . by adulthood of shared environmental effects on iq for example family income education and home environment with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in iq than with strangers from these studies they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for iq difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on iq to fully account for group differences.. studies of us comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races for blacks and for whites across the entire range of iqs despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examinedthis seems to be excessive detail. wrn has essentially recreated rushton/jensen arguments and placed citations in his citation. this essentially allows wrn to write an entire section as if it were incontrovertible based on various references without any possible response. the npov fact that should be reported is that rushton and jensen make some assertions not that they make some assertions and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up. if anything every one of their lines of evidence should be attributed directly to rushton and jensen as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the genetic hypothesis depending on the viewer. it seems very weaselly in any case. can we agree these four points should be removed from the article? comments? ==,0

5036,my c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a criticisms section. then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground. for the record i completely agree % that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders just as good if not better that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain task force that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches tth migraine cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin and inconclusive and controversial for nonmusculoskeletal disorders. part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for lbp. this is the most succint and precise summary there is. we can toss the reference in and call it a day. a majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence both in research and rd parties governments favours chiropractic care. we cant let ernst conclusions which have been rebutted and invalidated skew what is now generally accepted. notice the terms too generally etc.,0
5037,i found a better reference.in page theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women. of these only the first is common.and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous and per cent for monogamous unions.the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either. this had been sitting on the shelf for over years deep in the recesses of the basement. murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.,0

5048,yes i agree wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now. vitali has considered fighting huck after huck defends his cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching chisora. he wants to fight haye but haye wants to much money to make it happen clearly hes trying to cash out. that might be it for his career. since other pp boxers have more sections i dont see the issue with adding more for vitali. but we can decide that in the future after his next fight. for now there is only the chisora fight. given the slap in the prefight conference spitting in wladimirs face before the fight and brawling with haye in the postconference i think this is worthy of a headline. its also one of the most defining fights of vitalis career as he won it at an old age with only one arm.,0
5049, redennis browns final warning i didnt mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. i didnt violate the final warning curtisnaito did multiple times. the exact wording of the warning was if either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility bludgeons a discussion violates wpidht acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of hours. at no point did i push the boundaries of civility bludgeon a discussion violate idht act in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. curtisnaito displayed the exact same kind of idht behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions and when told explicitly that he was violating dennis browns final warning he kept doing it.your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual when nothing i had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning was an offtopic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.i understand you dont like me but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly? 聖やや ,0

5062, i was thinking about this last night and came to two conclusions first focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor if possible to global warming and denialism. dont tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous.. second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions. join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate. and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert. done the page is impregnable. take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer. using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end. barbara boxer is a politician. every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both. even more — and this is important — barabara boxer is not a runofthemill politician. it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. in short the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what? test. i intend to delete that one sometime soon too. i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thankyou to the editors who revert me every time they do so. or maybe a barnstar? i dunno some token of gratitude or other. •  ,0

5182, the truth about the sinn féin ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party. how he broke the sinn féin constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn féin membership. and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. in section b. of the sinn féin constitution read as follows“no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. the adams leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis. its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle.b. shall not draw their salaries for personal use. parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser’s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as followsthat section b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the ard chomhairle. obviously motion infringes section b. section b. was in effect at the time this resolution was presented. its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure. he should have sought a majority decision to amend section b. in and returned in to propose entering leinster house. trying to amend section b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist county parliament” in the same resolution was a logical impossibility. can anybody say that the wording“that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle?clearly adams was in breach of section b. and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution .brian feeney in his book sinn féin turbulent years puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section b by introducing a motion in allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the sinn féin constitution. this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section b in any way. to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. in fact the line adams added in was superfluous as the sinn féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.of course its not illegal to amend or remove section b. section b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies. it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority. the reason for doing so could be many. perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic. in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason. but you,0

5257,i have removed the china section if in the future someone comes up with several reliable sources that state that certain events that happened in china from whatever period was a genocide then it should be included on this page but currently in my opinion there has not been enough scholarly sources presented to justify its inclusion. it is better to have no information about a subject in an encyclopaedia wrong information. i can not emphasize this enough. there seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative i heard it somewhere pseudo information is to be tagged with a needs a cite tag. wrong. it should be removed aggressively unless it can be sourced. this is true of all information but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons. –jimmy wales see wpproveit ,0

5305,and paganismsouthgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university rejected catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition’ including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a ´ satru´ alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party. further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins. southgate believed that wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity’. another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate roman emperor julian ii.this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’. the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmler’s ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’ the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’. for southgate as for evola tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene. this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothicindustrial dark ambient black and ‘viking’ metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth. although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging ‘antiantiestablishment’ probush rightwing punk movement. although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’. southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.this is not simply cynical manipulation. southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. his fanzine tribal resonance ‘the voice of the racial avantgarde’ reveals southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’. through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’ southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance. by creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.the struggle for cultural heg,0

5495, pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offlinehiim not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous.does this mean i hadnt registered? i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have. i always use my real name in signatures.and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link.thanksdennis bathorykitszbathorybathorythanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear. whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name. i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w. bush at least if its not already taken. wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently. all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself. thats what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym. it is not independently verified against some external identity database. and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia. we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials.by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathorykitzs. that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system. such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you. that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia. when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit. users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia. but those are all manual checks. there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.likewise no one can inherently trust the email address. the way internet domains are set up anyone could register and create any email name they wanted. like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority. and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.most people are honest. but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not. thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security. the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours. how can a bank know that youre really you? and how far can that trust be extended? under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable? how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible. unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate. anyway ill get off my soapbox now. thanks for your message.to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia. the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top. that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols. you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages. you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes . when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp.again welcome to wikipedia. talk ,0

5556,hi math. thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. i find it very interesting. her pictures of womens bodies as commodities are very disturbing while her photos of morrissey are beautiful. i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book but i couldnt order it from amazon apparently they cant ship it to my country.anyway i know what youre talking about information on linder and ludus is very hard to find. besides the ludus biography you quoted ive come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in the guardian article and here is a long and indepth articleher real name is linda mulvey. the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth liverpool and a bit on her background.i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article.besides the importance of being morrissey linder also appeared in southbank show on the smiths. what other magazine articles have you found about her? shes usually mentioned in connection with morrissey and even that is very rarely. the only magazine article i can think of is that infamous nick kent the face article on the smiths. there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance but its similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to plus some interesting quotes by richard boon and trotter. apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle that pete shelley wrote buzzcocks what do i get as a plea of unrequited love for her and that she inspired a lot of devotos early work. her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life besides cemetry gates shes mentioned in entries for miserable lie wonderful woman last night i dreamt that somebody loved me in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single and i wont share you. in the latter theres another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled crepuscule ludus restrospective the end of the note sounds very familiar oh linder. oh linder. ill see you sometime somewhere. however im not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again its not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours morrissey page is one of the examples but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so i dont know. ,0

5590,rsa labss now emc mit and acm are wrong? vquaker. i am used to accepting correction when it is due but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source rsa labs on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing. i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know it must be spurious. some people know that its better to get their legal information from government sources not wikipedia. if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide exposition or sanctioned resource then i believe the u.s. government would like to hear your ideas. further someone you know or knows you is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance. needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat. though i suspect you know this already. im not offended though just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard. i would ask you this if a user loses their smartcard i.e. cac and forgets their password with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person? there are organizations that will terminate you but i couldnt have said that in my expounding of the th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge. when we set out it was to provide reliable information if the mission has changed well who could tell? consider me a noncontributor from now onwe arent allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work it is an anathema. say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. i should expect nothing less after all i teach. what changed the tone was your dumbingdown and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone. smell? nonsequitur. you gave me things to read but im still waiting for you to cite wikipedias policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister. i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style organization and applicability be inline with one or more regulatory bodies?now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases do you have access to them elsevier jstor edas ieee springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them youre stuck in a google funk but i digress are full of references to fourth factor. that cash register key the manager uses when you return something yep someone you know. an thats been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful. i just didnt realize you alone set these standards. i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly. ,0

5649,moncrief do you even know what a shepherd is? i used to work on a cattle ranch so i know a bit about this stuff. to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep usually in flocks in the fields... unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others. the s werent biblical times. shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that downandout laborers got when they could get it. in fact thats an important part of proulxs story characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. afterwards ennis worked with cattle and jack worked most of his life in an office job not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark. however the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer the summer that so defined them. therefore id say that the relevant description especially in this paragraph discussing that summer would be shepherds. that however is more up for debate. i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. although anybody whos ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that thats just a circumlocution for shepherd. but since i dont want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page ill settle for that as a compromise. chris ,0

5685,the othello error ekman refers to the sheakspeares play of othello killing his wife who he suspected to love another man. all this based upon his wifes distress failing to listen to her alternative innocent explanations. the interpretation of behaviour. when a subject under questioning show signs of fear and/or distress it could indicate the subject is not telling the truth. the othello error refers to the fact that honest people may experience fear during questioning and show signs of fear while perfectly telling the truth. in essence you can not rely entirely on signs of fear as an indicator of truth or lie. you have to look beyond the signs.,0

5689,none beefart repliesthanks for you comments. few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles. i disagree with you about none. the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one. in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one. it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs. it has to be no one is a dinosaur. here are two examples from the oed e.j. howard except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable. p. rose people sought her... but none was a companion. however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from graham greene who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited. this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight. maybe i ought to as well . there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. e.g. none of the increase is due to.... here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing. i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase... ,0

5697, is this map accurate? =i see some problems with this map it seems to me that this map only shows the very first homosapiens immigrations not the further ones... a for example regarding new zealand this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that i suppose to be the morioris while we know the maoris the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them were actually polinesian... b europe is shown being occupied by settlers from anatolia those were the certainly the paleoeuropeans... this map does not show the further occupation of europe by the indoeuropeans who originated in the caspian basin migrated to europe and pushed the paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.c the brazilian amerindians are not of colombian ancestry they are either of caribbean origin the caribs and arawaks or of paraguayannorthernargentine origin the tupiguaranis. the bulk of the amerindians who were in brazil about the time of the arrival of the portuguese were these tupiguaranis. they came from paraguay and spread all over the brazilian coast till the valley of the amazon river. when you show a map where brazilian amerindians are all coming from colombia you are showing a totally contradictory information. d the dravidians reached india from ethiopia to yemen from yemen to oman from oman to southeast iran from southeast iran to the valley of indus. what is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of india by the indoeuropeans from iran through bactria.e the hipothesis of ancient waves of paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of north america is ignored while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the mithocondrial gene x xenia among northamerican native americans.f this map also seems to ignore the australoid migrations to south america some people claim that the australoids have reached south america before the mongoloids due to some archeological findings in brazil.anyways i believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homosapiens show on that map are only the first the early migrations and the route of their early settling in india should be corrected. also i would suggest a second map showing further homosapiens migrations now including the maori migration from polinesia the correct migrations in south america and the settling of the indoeuropeans in europe.... r. alberto,0

5724,reverting to last known edit by me. the article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. if sysops examine the network log files they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from / truth sites and the vast majority of exit links go to / truth sites. therefore removing that information was damaging wikipedias reputation. visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that jones is currently involved in which of course includes everything relating to / that was on that page.using the ct term to describe / theories is ad hominem and also not npov and therefore not civil. anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not npov and ask them to not edit the / pages.as the zogby poll shows % of america believes the government is covering up / and % want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.for now on any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using wikipedia protocol.also even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation i do apologize for them. anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. i expect anyone and everyone to be civil.,0

5789,referring to her as catherine i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone living or dead by their st names on wp if a female had a title she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy or lady dudley for amy robsart even though lady amy was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become lady dudley until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amys life nor was she then lady amy dudley as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke. i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just amy throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles but was told it was against wp rules though i wasnt pointed to a link for it. noblewomen are usually called by their st names round here as far as i can see even when they have surnames are not of something mary boleyn is called mary not lady carey or lady stafford catherine neville is called catherine not the duchess of norfolk etc theyre not royals. as for males i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley. i was banging head on keyboard going but no one just says the king all the time or refers to them as plantagenet or keeps changing their titles ie henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as catherine throughout the article without her title appended? ive only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me as my main interest is british history i am quite confused.,0

5800,actually im in complete agreement with you about the picture caption sorry i wasnt more clear.i know that in dye lasers its often common to have a filter tube around the lamp usually just for water flow to absorb the nir before it causes thermal shock in the liquid. ill look into this more.thanks for your explanation of spectralon as that makes a great deal of sense. yes it wouldve been helpful if the article had not been deleted. it is often helpful to include a small parenthetical explanation of specialized words anyway. i can see where using a polished and ar coated rod would be beneficial in such a cavity coupling more light than difussing it through the surface of the rod. i know from sad experience that keeping the light diffused either way is almost a necessity to keep the rod from cracking. { i believe i also read that on the kentek website and in one of the most accurate sources ive found on lasers principles of lasers by oratio svelto although the book is a little difficult to follow as % of it is written in math.anyhow thanks again for all of your assistance d,0

5840, disruptive activity please stop your disruptive editing. if you continue to vandalize wikipedia as you did at paracetamol you may be blocked from editing. 🍌 email yeah so i add two interesting and important new relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the paracetamol page. these are removed because you guys dont like primary sources? this is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with wikipedia. my wife is pregnant. i for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. i would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the first do no harm idea. the fact that you wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. ive continued to run into this kind of thing. you would think that academic journals have taken over wikipedia. the idea that i have actually improved the article with my additions and that others can improve it further has completely escaped much of the wikipedia culture these days. wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. you guys are disgusting really. you are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created wikipedia in the first place. the fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply. im sorry that ive upset you but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. that is why weve written wpmedrs which i pointed to when i reverted you. there is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at wpwhymedrs. the fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results cant be transferred into clinical practise. medrs is no catch all but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. i would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically for example by having fda warnings automatically added.i understand it may feel as if youre being reverted by a faceless mass but i assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive. 🍌 email this isnt about my feelings it is about your behavior. you revert me with no reason then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. this is why wikipedia is dying cannibalizing its editors and edits in a kafkaesque farce. congratulations im sure your nodoubt proper and uplifting zyzzyxrd will be cited upon its demise. you may want to try and comprehend your own actions and not my feelings. see . ,0

5852, as daft as it sounds yes if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wptruth wpverifable wprs wpnor and wpnor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. talk contrib as it says on my talk page i prefer to have discussions all in the same place. i am watching this page so please reply here. to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here. so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either youll insist on a source for that too? seriously you are mistaken on a few points. i think you need to read wpverify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace including everything in articles lists and captions must be verifiable. all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. emphasis added jeh note the distinction. you wrote if it cant be verified it gets removed. but first the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified. not only is it part of the definition of the term the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. so no we dont need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. and second except for blp issues wpv only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. this material didnt need a source and even if it did it isnt required to remove it right away. even for claims that really should have a citation to a wprs the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template. see templatecn. this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someones edit rather than simply reverting it. i suppose you could say well since i removed it its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source. yeah fine. so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs thats already there and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. no its not much work but consider does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? was it the best use of yours? and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future? also in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices. in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to sic. well that is true but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article nor even claim that such were wrong. so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. finally i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. after reading wpverify you should probably look at wpvandalismeven if misguided willfully against consensus or disruptive any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. edit warring over content is not vandalism. careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial detrimental but wellintentioned and vandalizing. mislabelling goodfaith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wpagf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it. in sum please be careful about undoing others edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wpverify. consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material. please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism. and you should never have intentions of editwarring so the statement that you dont have any here is troubling. why would you need to state such a thing if not for the possibility that you might have s,0

5861,what vandalism? jibba jabba you have two. btw what vandalism? communicator/kills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo? the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise. the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts. however the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots. obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time. ... dlomme //yup. communicator/kills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting. is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl? who cares? and believe me im no patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum. this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur. actually protection is not something to be taken lightly. being an admin and even though i am a diehard pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos. . farive nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere. protection this article is starting to get vandilized again. if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected. i wonder why vandilism is returning to it. get over it people the superbowls over so you want me to request semiprotection? communicator/kills bias?? the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots. whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given. when it gets to the part about the patriots winning superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them. ie under belichick the team went to three super bowls in four years... it should be consistant one way or the other.the sentence the patriots however were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii after winning the first games of their season. is very clumsily tacked on to the first section. i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev,0

5901, philosopher rfc philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead. this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career. note not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present. the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place. definitions obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article. philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ... anarchocapitalist anarchocapitalism ... is a political philosophy... voluntaryist voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy... athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy... primary source as stefan molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims. if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place. i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to. freedomain radio about page my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens. i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio. i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy. freedomain radio the show that molyneux hosts has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly universally preferable behaviour upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods? a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies. strong atheism the case for evacuating the middle ground article why i am a philosopher? video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy. an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts reality knowledge truth gods/religion ethics and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable. proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video philosophy questio,0

5903, why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.i reject such a stance. i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial. where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth. this is wrong. wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is. any attempt to do that is original research.instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability. put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources. if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that. if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict. where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or pov on the topic at hand.i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. obviously is because some users jadger and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their pov thats not discussion about the npov edits. thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ ,0

5933,wrong licensesi have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. the exceptions areimagewankhede on the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free creative commons licenses but failed to actually change the licensing. image concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a creative commons license as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. as such the photo may not be used on wikipedia except perhaps under fair use policy which probably doesnt apply or under panorama freedom depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic.image image description page implies that it is licensed for noncommercial use only contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia. in addition the link to the original source which could clarify which condition is correct of the image is missing.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved. image to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim the author should probably email the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.image the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons noderivative license a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia either.image no evidence of the image being under a free license.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image creative commons noderivative license.image all rights reserved.image creative commons attribution noncommercial noderivative license unacceptable on wikipedia.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image the link to the original source is missing no evidence that it is under the creative commons license.image taken from wikitravel. uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.image who made this image?there are several issues here. there are multiple creative commons licenses not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia. in particular licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and cant be used on wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy creative commons atrribution and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay. also there are multiple versions of the licenses creative commons atrribution sharealike . . . and . are all distinct licenses. the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the . versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older licenses you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. as far as i can see flickr only uses the . versions of the licenses.in addition some of the flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient either. you should ask the authors to do one of the followingchange the flickr page to license the image under creative commons attribution or attribution sharealike license apparently this would change the licensing for all images and this may not be what they intend to dopost a message to the image page with a text similar to the followingi creator of the image agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license link alternately under the creative commons attribution sharealike license link. this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.email the wikimedia foundation permissionsenatwikimediadotorg with a message similar to the above also specifying which image images the user intends to release under the license. this would be the best choice if the author doesnt want to reveal his identity on wikip,0

5935,as i suspected complete nonsense. your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is. you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided. i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption. i am not a stupid person. i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick.you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability commentby the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.heres a few points for you to think on.wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.then lets consider the arbcom an article. what then is this articles content?hmm lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of? why members. so that means the content of the committee is its members. so an election is a decision on the content of this article.so.members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.you dont like that?wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.but arbcom is not an article. it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions.is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership? if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid? would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder? if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing? can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? the questions were politely put. they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom. they were not deferential. which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully. do not try to bully me.finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here. ,0

5944, misleading reference to study? in the section on lead paint in art which i largely wrote someone added the followinglead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids often from fingerprints. as a result many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited. their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that wasnt absolutely clear. but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle dont usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections. and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artists paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead. normally flake white is used only by oil painters and theres no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. cooperstown is a wellrespected institution but as of now im sticking with the classic ralph mayer. flake white may get slightly yellowish after centuries but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. if someone has more information on this please mention it here otherwise when i come back im going to delete that paragraph or water it down no pun intended.,0

5966,with over college students studying abroad every year theres bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around. while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.misconception studying abroad is very expensive.truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad. lets say the tuition at your school is $ per semester and room and board is another $. now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry. you are now well over $ for the semester. well all but one of our programs in spain is under $ per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.tabmisconception i cant use my financial aid to study abroad.truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans pell grants etc. can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well. it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money.truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program. the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had. if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends. since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year its a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. misconception ill be so busy with schoolwork that i wont get time to see the country im in.truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about + photos from a long list of countries. students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad.truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then its true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad. if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine. the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.misconception most of the world hates americans so i wont be safe.truth theres no doubt that there are a lot of people who dont like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people. if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous. there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe. go to the u.s. state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.studying abroad is a onceinalifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of. before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts. i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you youll be hopping the first flight abroad.one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad. here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countriesstudy abroad spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid salamanca and sevilla. study abroad england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london. study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence. study abroad france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aixenprovence and avignon. ,0

6035,first i just realized via your question that i could answer here. assuming it saves.yes i finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary? i confess i did not at first even this morning.i realize i made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way. i would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies.what to do differently when groups go after me? write a better wikiquette name several people? go to wpani naming several people? do userrfcs naming several people? that is where i admit i need further advice. since a . year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it i dont know how to defend the recurrent references to it. let me say again it was a stupid overly generalized and exaggerated response but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent. i feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents/issues/etc or stating in detail my current views would be inappropriate even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different pov. but if theres some policy on this that i missed i sure wish people would help me out with that.,0

6046,hello zwack gb and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions.i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article. your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. to reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. to start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other. if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. here are a few other good links for newcomersthe five pillars of wikipediahow to edit a pagehelp pagestutorialhow to write a great articlemanual of stylei hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date. if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page. again welcome,0

6066, september utci love how i specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission. your line response was the equivalent of nananana booboo as far as i am concerned. lets dissect these lines.you dont understand propaganda.that is a loaded statement if i ever read one. i have read up on the term propaganda thanks very much and my readings are not simply limited to this website which i feel is narrow in its scope. i have been on a program that toured the death camps of poland and studied the use of propaganda in nazi germany. i am currently awaiting a response from a phd who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry and it is with respect to our point of contention here. funny i cant find any work you have done on this subject mr. jensen yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. i have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. you use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.i am not denouncing advertising for products i consider harmful and this is what you need to understand because i have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. this statement you have just made is a personal attack. additionally it is incorrect. i dont consider the product to be harmful. it is harmful. this is not an opinion but a restating of facts by the iarc/who and health organizations worldwide based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. if it were simply an opinion i can understand why you could be frustrated. but the irony mr. jensen is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer among other health risks please take the time i urge you to read any or all of the references i quoted in my submission all from established medical journals. the industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant says that uv exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed not proven whatsoever and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven e.g. cancer prevention base tan exaggerated and can be achieved through safer means e.g. vitamin d exposure. so please enlighten me mr jensen as to what propaganda is? is propaganda not a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?. thats the definition on the wiki page right? i am sure you have head of a systematic review that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. it is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. well thats what i use and thats what the world health organization used when they came to an unbiased conclusion that uv exposure from tanning beds as well as the sun is a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes. in my submission i think i clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points including the systematic reviews i mention. is this not the same as presenting one side of an argument to influence the attitude of the community? or is it that as you say i just dont understand propaganda? i have to say it yet again to you because i think this is such an important point that i have to drive home this is not my opinion. tanning beds cause more harm than good fact. tanning industry sites present the good which is partly true and negate the bad partly false and this is also a fact. if you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of good business its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product and the result is advertising that is propaganda. the industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics e.g. suggesting that cancer society and neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children blaming o,0

6079,untitledalso see infobox vote codes and minor state please stop since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there. is algeria minor? iran? its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted. as for making ma a country code for western sahara its not. ma is a code for morocco and so it is in moroccos infobox. eh was created for western sahara so that is its country code. as far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the united nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places. ❤t☮c☺m☯ it does not need a definition to be in the article. a minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council ... etc. as to the eh domain it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for ws but it is not assigned .ma being the one used in the territory. the same thing applies for the currency the mad is the currency of morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. the same thing goes for the iac the time zone + utc etc. they are the ones used in the territory. these things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. as to your ridiculous claim of the un considering the territory as occupied i already explained to you the difference between a un position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in of the algeriancuban drafted document that has no obligation on the un. the zionism=racism example is the brightest one for you to understand it. i will revert to the version that was in use before the anon ip started this mess. it does since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense. what states that .ma is being used in the territory? do you have any evidence of this at all? the same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. to ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards. western sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states im not going through this with you again. ❤t☮c☺m☯ ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. minor states is indeed a value judgement although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena algeria is not a big newsmaker per se. but in the interest of neutrality merely noting african asian and latin american states seems reasonable. at the same time if koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. same standards on language. evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in western sahara provinces using .ma. it is trivially easy to find that. koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding. what is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in western sahara? « d. trebbien talk may utc good question. since effectively all internet service to the western sahara is via maroc telecom or other moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in moroccan territory exws provinces largely in the casarabat area. technically i am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service. presumably the regional investment office of laayoune may have its server physically in laayoune. other similar offices may also. it strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the moroccan address .ma. polisario partisans may not like that but its effective reality. country codes i find it reasonable th,0
6080,i see that this debate has in any case been preempted by userkotniski who has created and populated the categoryconstituent countries of the united kingdom. in my opinion this is unacceptable as the debate is still in progress indeed it has barely begun and the new category name has the rejected term constituent countries and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main articles name countries of the united kingdom and the term found in most other relevant articles. personally i dont see why wales et al should not be categoried as european countries. i am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here. this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the proper and logical alternative i.e. countries of the united kingdom if the need for it is proven and accepted. ,0
6081,editing edits on wiki improve by evolution only the best survives. they become best by change after change after change. i find i make two kinds of edits. ones which add content and ones which improve language. i fancy i am quite good at writing smooth prose but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. if i have a fact to insert or point to make the primary thing is to make or insert it. then someone else can smooth it along or i may do so myself when i have more time or after leaving the piece and rereading it. it can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go because you do not spot your mistakes. as to our last exchange in severus snape yes i agree i put in a clumsy statement but i was trying to express a particular point. you improved the flow but slightly altered my point. i changed it again back a little to my original intention though you also added something. cheers.,0

6099,thanks hi davidthanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at talkdepoprovera. and for reminding me its guy fawkesi feel that i dont need to assure you that i will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re pfizer/lacroix/bmd in the current disputebut just in case please be assured that i will not. it might actually be helpful to have other people than mastcell and i making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere as well if not enough editors contribute in a week or two weeks time.i will be slowtorespond/disengaged on the depo talkpage in hopes of keeping things cool while still continuing to advance the discussion. there is no hurry and deadline after all.i dont know if youve been following the discussion at emergency contraception but mastcells first post to depo occurred less than minutes after the conclusion of this exchange . it seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking but it also seems to me that he arrived at depo already quite upset/confrontational etc. because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e. he is angry re ec page and following me to depo and dalkon shield to express animosity i think it is better that the depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.remember remember ,0
6100,matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title. witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics ashkenazi hebrew cantonese linguistics american english sephardi hebrew etc etc... arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or arvanitika language are out of the question. i dont want to use arvanitika albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title. therefore the only options are arvanitic or arvanitika. they can and should be used. arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used. what is wrong with it? it is neutral. it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica etc aree wrong. macedonian and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect. if britannica or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such. no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. why should they be treated as such. every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title. arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies. what unesco britannica etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor. i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will. are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english? no so stop that straw man argument. arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy. the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia. we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them. regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies? that is what you are asking me to do,0

6170,ndpaffiliatedi added a fact tag to the fourtimesreinserted modifier ndpaffiliated to the mention of bill tieleman other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty nor are publishers such as canwest which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the bc liberal party also one of the partys major financial contributors. its not that tieleman isnt an ndper but his credentials go beyond his ndp politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party also. im responding partly also to this edit by . ive puzzled long and hard over my own realworld coi on bc political articles but i see no reason to recuse myself from participation in bc political articles though generally i give them as wide a berth as possible but when i recognize pov political activity/wording as a responsible wikipedian i cant not say something about it or challenge the povism and coi/spin edits when i see them. my interest here is to prevent wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine of any party and to make sure wikipedia principles are observed particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect wikipedia guidelines or concepts like wpnpov. in the case of this item about bc rail theres lots missing including the search of the clarkmarrissen home during the opening of the investigation and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case. but theres also lots of other commentators particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like sean holman laila yuile and bc mary who have similarly spoken out about clarks involvement in the bc rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public and of the informed media. she may have been out of teh way for the hst fracas and the big media have pronounced her clean of that but he big media also have maintained a veil of silence over bc rail. the current text says that she resigned for family reasons but its wellcitable that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the bc rail affair. and about the tieleman thing unless every time conservativeaffiliated columnists or bc liberalaffiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims often false its not fair to single out tieleman for this thats the reason for the cite tag tielemans own byline says only bill tieleman is one of bcs best known communicators political commentators and strategists. bill writes a politics column tuesdays in hours newspaper and the tyee online magazine. bill has been communications director in the b.c. premiers office and at the bc federation of labour. bill owns west star communications a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour business nonprofits and government. and frankly seeing whats going on with the ndp and teh things the party council/james supporter types have been calling him he may not be ndpaffiliated much longer.... ,0

6223,note from the subject bookśrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta«and he did not have to flatter anyone support anyone or manage anyones life. his mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. he saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. despite his advanced age he felt that he had barely begun his work. yet he felt confident. he had his vision of a world association of devotees. it was not an idle dream although he was not certain how it would all come about. but he knew his duty. for the present he would go on describing his vision the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters in articles and books. but as soon as possible he should go to the west. westerners he had concluded were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding more than his fellow indians they would be open to the message of the absolute truth. he knew he should go. and he would goif kṛṣṇa desired.abhay lived frugally in vṛndāvana keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. he carefully kept a ledger just as if he were running a substantial business even though his purchases were only a little milk a few vegetables charcoal for cooking bus rides and his major expenditure postage.abhay composed a bengali poem vṛndāvanabhajana. its opening stanzas were especially selfreflective and personal.i am sitting alone in vṛndāvanadhāma.in this mood i am getting many realizations.i have my wife sons daughters grandsons everythingbut i have no money so they are a fruitless glory.kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material natureby his strength it has all become tasteless to me today.yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye taddhanaṁ śanaiḥi gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom i am merciful. how was i able to understand this mercy of the allmerciful?»śrīla prabhupāda is here in the advanced age of – his supporters friends and family left him broke.śrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta another reference«prabhupādas most ambitious literary undertaking the completion of śrīmadbhāgavatam was to be no less than sixty volumes. he had begun in india in and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. now kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing vedic literatures and for travelling and he was working at an amazing pace.»prabhupāda is here in advanced age of starting to write his bhaktivedanta purports – i guess in india it was an advanced age but not in florida.,0

6310,i understand the confusion. you would think that since a primary source is a firsthand account it would be the most reliable. however the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. also there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. thats when a secondary source comes in. a secondary sources author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion evaluation and/or conclusion. furthermore secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. it helps us avoid original research. one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions whether intentionally or not which would be considered original research. you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wprs and wpsource. ,0

6336,delete example?would it be appropriate to delete the example section at the bottom? mar utci think so dont see what it adds. mar utcyes. moreover it is not an example of random variable. its just a realization of random variable. hardly misleading. mar utci thought this was very useful because it showed an example where the map was not the identity map. i propose putting it back. false statementa continuous random variable does not always have a density. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... definitioni dont like the definition here not that im letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting but could this be considered a clearer definition?random variablethe outcome of an experiment need not be a number for example the outcome when a coin is tossed can be heads or tails. however we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. a random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. the value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.there are two types of random variable discrete and continuous.a random variable has either an associated probability distribution discrete random variable or probability density function continuous random variable.i think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.s which are neither discrete nor continuous for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type the current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. the above definition is far better on both counts and so i will put it on the page. btw sorry about the no summary edit i hit the enter key accidentally. examples a coin is tossed ten times. the random variable x is the number of tails that are noted. x can only take the values ... so x is a discrete random variable. a light bulb is burned until it burns out. the random variable y is its lifetime in hours. y can take any positive real value so y is a continuous random variable. i think the above definition for the original reference pls search via google explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value rather like a numeric index to a database record. this would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. the earler wikiedia definition led me to comment on another wikipedia definition incorrectly because i think i may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this wikipedia definition.a random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. this examplejust assigns another event to an event. could we change it to something likeconsider a game where if a is rolled on a fair sixsided die player wins and otherwise player wins. let x represent the number of times player wins. thenandor maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? what do you think? this section should begin with a sentence of the form a random variable is .... to avoid this is to show that you don,0

6348,an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the passover holiday. the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover according to tradition.some jews currently live in iran. the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years. while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. so seems to be the way to go. ,0

6423,controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip. in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology. in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around. so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy. mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw. i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw. rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means. i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for. however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine. the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines. the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable. agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines. the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips. just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that.what i suggest is a compromise. i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or. mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use. do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated? without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage. im thinking something like this....clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however mw defines it as such.this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated. i think this is fair. note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here. im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly. ,0

6473,apparently other editors agree that the edits i made were justified. a group of meatpuppets working as a team to revert an article to their own pov is what has caused this block. at issue was the advert tag which is justified was placed on the article by one editor replaced by me replaced again by another editor and replaced again by me. three editors so far have indicated the tag belongs there. im sure a forth editor is going to weigh in on this side too. the article is riddled with brochure language. please note that i was removing brochure language right up to the lockup of the article. theres still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed. additionally i dont believe i broke the rr rule which requires a fourth reversion. ,0

6477,i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article theres a problem. either the history and characteristics should be expanded of the list should be culled. i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between and others...myself included. we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples. there we did trappist abbey and foreign. foreign includes all nonbelgium examples. this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia not a list. people can find lists anywhere and the article should reference this. also the style statistics are bad. when you say style statistics it sounds like a prescription not a description. an encyclopedia should follow the latter and if the former is used a citation should follow...and youll not find a valid one for this style in its country of origin.,0

6491,im back. i already created id occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class c when i do i collected a massive number of diff edits on balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is on record getting blocked for saying this about greeks under a previous handle. not to mention his personal talk page is one big antigreek rant fest pointing to questionable fyrom news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titlesno assfuckers has a nice ring to it d use it as a pejorative term. i was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin futper and a few others e.g. macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antigreek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking im going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. as for the current naming disputing article... i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i dont think that reduces the existential threat to greece. communism fell years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left. there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately. i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasnt greek i didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didnt think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. assuming you see it as relevant yourself of coursefebruary the fyroms president kirov gligorov at an interview by the foreign information service daily report easten europe stated we are slavs who came to the region in the sixth century. we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians.january the fyroms ambassador in washington d.c. mrs. ljubica acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great. we are slavs and we speak a slavic language. greece is the fyroms second largest trading partner and its number one investor.february the fyrom.s ambassador to canada gyordan veselinov in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great. we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian. there is some confusion about our identity.i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior. he directly contradicts fyroms own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognitionprime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan who claims to be related to alexander the great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient macedonians. and dont get me started on that incident where gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of united macedonia was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article,0

6510, about your comment on elaragirls talk page hello dev i couldnt help but notice your comments on talk page under the heading esperanza so im sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy or elaragirls. i wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with esperanza and some editors how shall i say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others. as for the governance issue i personally dont understand the current structure and i dont feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.i still think that an offwikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on esperanzas page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on wikipedia. whats one more click of the mouse? just so you know i had participated a little in the coffee lounge but i got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which i felt were sexist offensive and not at all belonging on wikipedia. because i had participated only to a limited extent my overall edit count as of wasnt seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.i had proposed a hypothetical merger between esperanza the kindness campaign and concordia and while i still think that many of their stated goals overlap i also feel that esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. i was unaware that esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. if you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant chalk it up to my own shortsightedness not to esperanza as a whole.i know that we may differ in our views of what to do with esperanza but at least the mfd and in particular comments by you elaragirl and others have given the impetus for esperanza to examine itself. thank you for that.since ive typed this much i might as well invite you to review me at editor review. thanks again for your participation in all of this. ,0

6612,for what its worth i suggest you refrain from pushing the socks remarks around as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. given that an spi has been opened and checkuser denied due to stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone it serves no purpose to accuse him further just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. no one is going to win that type of argument. also i suggest you stop calling cowboy jake from now on as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. clearly he is determined to push his case and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. but if you give them enough rope theyll eventually hang themselves with it. challenging suspected socks nonstop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. spi does not support the claim at present and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf whatever the outcome. im sure by rotating ip he probably means proxies. it isnt important though. cheers  chat • rff ,0

6628, utcan interesting comment convict leasing isnt the same as slavery where theres ownership and title. however i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery...true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. one ended w/ the th amendment and the other was legalised under the th amendment not the corwin amendment of . in other words what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause? wwhat do you think they were referring to? futhermore i dont see a problem including this in the article so long as it is a small reference and not the focus of the article. as to scholarship there is reputable work on this and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business plantations mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. yes they were mostly black. the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery though not chattel. this was systematic and went on until ww though todays version is slightly different. now some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. slavery by another name by douglas blackmon who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic. thats the point. this is far from original research and there are other scholars whove written about it. now i havent edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here but id like to know the issue as it is now. how do other editors feel? one other thing american historians do not always agree on things and i have noticed at least one conspicious neoconfederate argument in the article unsourced though on a different part of the article. so yes its important to look at historians but on some topics theres a whole lot of rubbish particularly w/ slavery issues so a consensus by historians may never happen and sadly ideological agendas do exist and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources. id say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important. july,0

6724,please consult the article ball culture which states drag queen or transgendered. wpor does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together. as well the term femme queen does not have an article so the term is currently of dubious usage as its a neologism which wp policy suggests to avoid using. you state a source tgmsmnet however neither this page nor the mainpage refer to such a reference. from the way you talked about it i linked it to the mstsw reference. in the future if you could could you please site resources on this page by using this form? that way it shows up like this and one can simply click on the resource rather than search through the article for the reference itself. your data is backed up there as well. however we still have issue... how would the cdc consider a postop mtf living in stealth as anything else but a female... the mtf would obviously not admit to being a transsexual and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female. i wait for further evidence that tg/ts is caused by biological factors and thus the term biological male/female becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with cais is biologically a male... as well i understand the point of not using wp as a soap box... however in talk pages im still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having urap... ,0
6725, the bands legacy beggars banquet etc. an anonymous user is repeatedly misreading the guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it. heres the direct quotethe spark for fairport taking this watershed turn was the bands album music from big pink the record that along with bob dylan and the bands basement tapes bootleg brought about a widespread musical volteface in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. among the rock aristocracy its influence was evident in the beatles illfated backtobasics project let it be the rolling stones purple patch that began with beggars banquet and eric claptons decision to call time on cream.the anonymous user takes issue with this statement claiming that music from big pink could not have influenced beggars banquet because of chronology i.e. that the stones were almost done recording the album when big pink came out. but read the statement it does not say that it influenced the recording of banquet but the purple patch that began with... etc. this seems clear to me. i would like to hear some other editors opinions on this matter. thefortyfive ,0

6753,article evaluation article evaluation for this assignment i was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about change management. the first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic however it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. they key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. the information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. it most definitely covers a variety of topics including the reasons for such change. in addition to that the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. there is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. the article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text which can be found in the reference section. the contribution considers a variety of perspectives however i think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. it takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. i think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. the article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. it does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. in terms of article length the only thing i would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. overall it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. i couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. in terms of structure i would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.,0

6772,i am slowly working on many of the mountains of washington. i do one or two a day.i have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created. one is a list of highest points in each of washingtons counties. i research if they need disambiguation. so for big horn mountain i had to research whether there were other things called big horn there are tons of them. as you can see there are hundreds of uses of big horn. if i can i find newspaper articles relating to the place. but due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship... i have not been able to isolate one article about big horn. big horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in lewis county washington. but i did find a couple of trip reports. hello i have reviewed your editorial review request. good user keep up the good work aqurius   talk usercheeselor blocked thanks. wpwdefcon appears fine to me. penmon anglesey hi there. you may have noticed that ive been adding to the excellent article you created here a few extra refs and some photographs plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer. oh and i renamed it too can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment? i would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for good article status i havent done this before but it seems to comply with the criteria or to be nearly there anyway. what do you think? you baked the cake i just added the icing fingers crossed... oh dear... this might interest you. re wphd totd i was wondering about that too. wikipedia talktip of the day would be the appropriate place to bring this up but i dont think its very active. other than that the admins noticeboard or miscellanious village pump may be places to bring it up that would get a faster response. may tc penmon revisited hello again. the ga review picked up various points some easy to fix some not. anyway ive had a go and fixing things and i think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that ive missed particularly points and . then perhaps itll get its ga badge great work. ive renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away. good news i think that means that you and i are entitled to display this as a reward for our hard work. right wheres next? re user talkais importing scripts your looks fine and in fact it worked when i copied it to my account to test. try bypassing your cache again and see if it works now. june tc the original barnstar the original barnstar i noticed that your fairly new and saw that your edits were impressive and so ive decided to award you this original barnstar talk == re user,0

6780, deletion of dave warwak page wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on dave warwak an educator of vegan practices and animal rights. i see that your comment on the reason for deletion was the only thing he is known for is being fired however that is not the case in the animal friendly vegetarian vegan community. in fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food. why would you find it so crucial to speedy delete a page that simply speaks of cruelty free living and aims to educate people on the truth about their food? is that information threatening to wikipedia for some reason? and i wouldnt think as a wiki admin that your opinion on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted. you may know mr. warwak as only being fired but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition. please show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page.,0

6871,{{unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine. why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?. for exampleand this is... yep maybe you guessed it... question why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name... like say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor? specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid?. heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor?. ready for one more? then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment ?. oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking rr that says that but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense? well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say? well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give her/him a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingright/matchingconsensusisnodefense rule?... ,0

6911,==etymology==this etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many waysthe greek name tigris comes from the old persian word for tiger and means the fast one. it might also be argued to come from kurdish too. in kurdish tir means arrow. this means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.tîjtûj means sharp pointing and cutting. since the letter j doesnt exist in greek tîjtûj became tig later greek at the end of words is sonex is used tîjtijrtigtigrtigris. first of all the persian for tiger is babr not tigr or anything like it. the greek word tigris meaning tiger may be related to persian words within the same family as tigr but that is not the persian meaning of the words.second the kurdish and farsi word for arrow tir comes from middle persian tigr which also means arrow.third the word tij or rather tiz sharp is certainly related to tigr but they belong to the same word family they are not the same word.ill try to come up with something better.,0

7039,i understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work. i understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution. it is the paragraph in question especially the example in that paragraph which distorts the workings of evolution. the phrase “it need only increase at a rate of . cm per generation = cm/” easily gives the impression of progressive linear change. the anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often i assume inadvertently find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of darwinian evolution. from these i have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions. carl sagan in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the galaxy. i read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.,0

7051,this is such a fun entry. devotchkai once had a coworker from korea and not only couldnt she tell the difference between usaenglish and british english she had trouble telling the difference between different european languages. kind of keeps things in perspective eh? not suprising. while i can easily tell the difference between french german italian spanish dutch etc. put me in a room with a chinese japanese korean vietnamese and a thai speaker and i probably couldnt tell the difference. if i saw it written id probably have somewhat more luck though. sjkvietnamese has more syllablefinal consonants than japanese i think you can tell them apart that way maybe. is this right? juuitchansomeone suggested heath robinson and rube goldberg as a vocabulary difference. its certainly an interesting parallel but i dont think it really belongs here. they were both artists with their own style and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested. at any rate they cant quite be considered translations because as an adjective rube goldberg is more specific describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions heath robinson in contrast is more surrealistic or fantasyoriented. ldcas an american i would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt a flat is an apartment and rubbish certainly is trash. granted i agree that a fag is not a cigarette and underground is not a subway. i may do some actual research and come back and fiddle with that list. eean.i think americans certainly understand the use of bum for butt rubbish for trash and to a lesser degree flat for apartment. but we dont use those terms much. point to a container for discarded things and an american will say thats a trash can a brit will say thats a rubbish bin. americans are more likely to use rubbish in the sense of bullshit. ldci deleted the following pair limited ltd and incorporated since they actually mean different things. incorporated means a corporation limited means a limited liability corporation you can also have unlimited liability corporations and no liability corporations. british and australian also ltd is roughly equivalent to american llc. sjki would say torch was much more common than pocket lamp which sounds quite oldfashioned. flashlight would be more easily recognised than the latter.yes id call it a torch and it would probably be labeled as a flashlight in its manufacturers packaging. imo torch is colloquial british english the anomeoh so flashlight is correct british usage? my dictionary said am. and the oxford english dictionary carried flashlight only in the meaning of photography. then ill remove the entry again. axelboldt,0

7061, july utcwell yes thats fine but the point here is that there is no publishers statement made about anything in that sentence. the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. if the resource says joe at worms then we write joe ate worms. about tarnishing any reputation that isnt the point at all. and about accepted practices in the publishing world this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. about people keeping records of how many books were published i think you missed the point there. publishers weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. they are a secondary source. do you see how thats different? about the article on fip it hadnt any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. fip and are the same entity. facim is also the same entity. this is known. having the same board of directors as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim® etc. makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources. ,0

7080, henrietta van laer says no. its not that having an agenda at all is a problem for wikipedia. wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda prosocialists liberals greens and gays determined to vilify and demonize conservatives. it is a completely biassed source. its articles on socalled leftwing parties are blatant whitewash while those on socalled rightwing parties are nothing but vilification most of it based on flimsy thirdhand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. instead of detailing their policies wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.pov in wikispeak = different pov to us the wikipolice. i also get the impression that wikipeople are pretty young. there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. how naive can you get? i dont know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average. naturally they are inclined to vote labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a rightwing taxcutting party. many of them earn two or three times the average wage and like the fat cats they get generous pensionpackages too. added to the votes of the millions of people who live longterm on state benefits this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honestjoe workers or lowpaid. but wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics with a poster of che guevara on the wall his hair streaming in the wind.,0

7119,slr chronology bibliography is completehi murderwatcher. this is paul again. this is to let you know that i have completed the slr chronology bibliography for you and that i am going to try to upload a pdf copy to your talk page as soon as i finish this note. this may take a while because ive never uploaded a pdf before.youre absolutely right it would be great if some of the old modern photography stuff could be added to wikipedia. however you can be sure that theyre still under copyright. pre american workforhire copyrights are generally years and on years. the real question is who owns the copyright today? since modern went under there have been many media company sales and resales the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission. in fact the current owner might not even know that it owns moderns copyrights. orphaned copyrights are a major unresolved fair use issue in the information age.speaking of first cameras mine was a simple vivitar pointandshoot. my parents gave it to me for getting straight as in the th grade. it was of course a bad camera but it opened up a world of possibilities. from the vivitar i eventually learned about the existence of the pentax auto slr. it was then one step to mm slrs and i got a nikon fe in . the fe is also the reason why the bulk of my modern photography magazine citations begin around .im sorry to hear about your disputes with the admins over your nonphotography wkipedia entries. it would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your wikipedia activities over them. perhaps you could start a blog or create a myspace or facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the admins want. however i will respect whatever your decision is as i fully understand that the most sophisticated machine is nothing next to a human life.you can reach me on my talk page. thanks muchly ,0

7450,i think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. so if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldnt be a problem with it? particularly i imagine if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?i read each of the candidates statements and used that to judge if this question would be useful look at the time between asking the candidates questions. also look at the ignore all evidence question this occurred to me as i was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the days question plus this shows it was not a spam question to all candidates i did pay attention to their statements.this is the question i posed to select candidates.what general concerns do you think are raised by the days of silence from the communitys admins in this ani? are there any other general concerns which arise from the ani?do these quotesameliorate add to or amplify concerns?do you agree with the substance of the jehochman quotes?if an essay wpignore all the evidence were written what concerns would be behind it and what could be done about them?if you can point me to another ani where lies and deceit by two admins within an ani were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to days then i will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates substituting this with that example. would that be acceptable?have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? or is this the only one? of course to answer that you would also have to answer can you say in all honesty that you think ruslik did not lie in this ani? if you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self? ,0

7483, legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. the source reads the european union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. lets have a look at the law itself. framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences ... public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group. in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case. whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal. as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredis the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court? ,0

7578,balance==i find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory. to introduce badoglios career by saying he was an italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing red cross hospitals and ambulances during the ethiopia campaign. due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely. thats words about his military and political career and about his activities as a war criminal. the war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence. if this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of badoglios involvement in the events. it seems to me far more important to stress the facts that badoglio was one of italys most senior military figures during the second world war despite his doubts about italys strategic capabilities and that he became prime minister after the downfall of mussolini. badoglios role in the inexplicable two months delay between july and september when italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while germany rushed troops south to fortify the italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career. whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively badoglios inaction condemned italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war. this article in its present form barely mentions those events. ==,0

7597,admin inputif you were in communication with an admin and were actively working on it you or the admin should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. quite frankly i dont believe the draft article youre working on is ready to go for the following reasons theres a number of grammar and spelling errors headers should not have caps except for first letter and should not be wikilinks bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only references shouldnt be generalized like youve put them. individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references see wpfn and wpcitet if you dont know how to do this the section on search engine submission software should be omitted entirely as its covered in a separate article. dont duplicate material thats what wiki links are for move the reasons why its notable media coverage awards to the st or nd paragraph please be aware that wikipedia is not a howto guide so instructional information about how to use the software is not appropriate. you can eliminate the further reading as the book is in the refs and get rid of the dummies graphic its not relevant to the particular program...it looks like youre plugging the book. akradeckispeaketh retrieved from ,0

7610,if the nazis meant reich as empire they could have made that clear by translating it that way in englishlanguage material they produced. they did not do so. they always used reich in english translations. for one of many examples see this page it is the official german government translation of a hitler speech. note that reich is always reich. the nazis did not consider frederick the great as having anything to do with the first reich. they did view him as a great german. the problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be a very accurate translation. wikipedia does not depend on what editors think it depends on what they can support with reliable sources. you have yet to provide a single reliable source that supports your point. i and others have provided quite a few supporting the opposite. ,0

7636, this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x for the following reasons. should sort amd or intel implementations as x? generally x was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa might or might name themselves with such as cyrix x intel pentium and so on. amds long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together. nowadays software labeled themselves as x are ia compatible software and use x or x differentiating with it. so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. . generations? what is the th generation x processor? who invented this kinda processors? amd k just says that it succeeds amd k rather than saying it is the th x processor and ive never heard intel call their x processors exceeding the th generation. and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the th x processor succeeding pentium iii but none confirmed this. so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and efficeon if the morph firmed on the system board implements x decoder call themselves as x processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor? at this situation what kind of processor is it? ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the th/th generation x? who is another jane austen making up another northanger abbey?. x is one architectureisa name? what such a ridiculous thing that ive ever heard on earth x is used to referring the processor a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. if it were the name of an architecture then in this logic way intel is one of the implementation of this architecture? ,0

7661,yeah they really exist. you need at least one w one fa from that class and one w one from that class and you can make the others from them a few carnivores species need more. essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition where for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids sugar vitamins and minerals fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as iv formulas. the reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w and you need w and w fatty acids to make lipids the w dha is your most common neural tissue fat. ill see what i can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. there is some quackery out there like pills that contain w because olive oil is cheap but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking actually unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly. btw there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. this destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all pufas. on such a diet even dogs get severe atherosclerosis and they are species highly resistant to it their hdls are higher than their ldls. so all this is quite fascinating. ,0

7767, ive come across variations on draughts as ive always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variationsdammspiel thats what the manual called it i think its also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue.turkish checkers similar settup to dammspiel/damenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares youd use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules.one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts dagger draughts or kings.played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts.i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man cant take a king. apparently according to this page thats the rules in italian draughts.,0

7902, march utcthat sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. the rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. you may think that this is obvious but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the ut report were influenced by the funding received.perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? i mean thats about the only way you could ever meet your demand. what an utterly absurd request. its easy to see why it was made though just set the bar so high it cant be jumped then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you dont like. maybe youd have me hack the email accounts of the authors fish around for evidence assuming there is even any there then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that i can cite on here. only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by texas. the universitys state is the heart and soul of us oil gas but thats certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true the university has multimilliondollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the united states not to mention other oil gas companies with interests in fracking. i have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links but only a fool would suggest the potential isnt there. if you dont like the juxtaposition just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak pathetic and denigrating as you like for all i care maybe something like socialist—nay communist—campaigners in the pay of a european maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest noting that... for comparison take the recent globalwarming sceptics at the heartland institute as soon as details of the institutes funding were leaked they were prominently reported in the press. we dont even need leaks here the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out as smm` and others have done. all you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. according to ian urbina we cant even get a decent untarnished report out of the epa unlike texas the epa doesnt even take industry funding for gods sake yet still it cant escape heavy industry pressure to redact. aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes i have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to though i am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry and their paidfor puppets in government to tone down or eliminate negative findings and the truly just ridiculous claims about frackings potential by people like lord browne here in england. and i couldnt care less if frackings safe or not. why should i? or anyone? if its not its not if it is... it is outside of a lunatic asylum who would care? if it is safe enough bring it on jobs tax receipts increased energy security reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldnt be interested in those things particularly given the current economic situation. what i dont like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material. ,0

7912,thanks very much for the restored toungoo map. borders its close enough but i wish its possible to use increasingly lighter shades. e.g. youve followed the presentday border more or less for the chinese border which i suppose is a reasonable representation of the line of control. but the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. anaukpetlun and thalun controlled some of koshanpye campaigns on top of presentday shan state and east of bhamo though not as extensive or deeper into yunnan as did bayinnaung likewise all the sawbwas in modern kachin state and sawbwas in northern shan state also paid dual tribute. but since its not technically feasible i guess well just have to provide an explanation on this. a number of locations are offsome by a lot. chiang mai ava kyaukse nyangshwe pegu and kale. also please add the cities of nan and chaing saen in lan na. nan was the easternmost possession. chaing saen kyaing thin was the capital of northern lan na. the burmese divided lan na into two.again thanks very much for the help. regards ,0

7997,i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i translate i use province of lower silesia etc. however here on wikipedia i have to go with decisions made long ago. the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. some polish people may not care about it because polish is a readerresponsible language so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. by contrast english is a writerresponsible language i.e. writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable. i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article pages . importantly this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity writing should be clear and concise. plain english works best avoid jargon and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. voivodeship is jargon understandable nearly exclusively to polish people.i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now its too late. i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia. ,0

8036, question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question i dont pay much attention to that page. in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. i havent yet worked in no original research. wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i dont see how that can be objective. bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al. but ive been somewhat overloaded at work. personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob. yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note i appreciate it i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication. ive never done any such thing. or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequencesive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isnt namecalling by a long stretch. im really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me wont make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. its the internet equivalent of stoning. this is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly. putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult. ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response. and please notice like abi avi is avraham the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness i counseled against piling on. talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen. yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite. thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh,0

8126,deletion of av news page just curious why the av news page is being deleted while its primary competitor antelope valley press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as av press and even more so than av town crier whose page is also allowed to be here i note.here is the contentthe av news began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in lancaster california usa. it was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in . in the av news added a website and in march much like the seatte postintelligencer the av news transitioned to a webonly publication. the av news covers the antelope valley area of los angeles county mainly the palmdale/lancaster urbanized area a us census bureau defined term and areas of north los angeles and southeastern kern counties including acton agua dulce edwards afb lake los angeles mojave quartz hill rosamond and santa clarita. the newspaper is conservative in its political stance. it is currently the official news publication of the lancaster jethawks a minor league baseball team in lancaster.historythe av news was founded by fran paolinelli in . she continues to work at the publication today. it began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at the paper conservative leaning holds strongly held views which can become controversial at times.competitors in its market are the daily news antelope valley press and the los angeles times.external linksav news official websitethe format is the same as the av press. there is less historical info that the av press because we have only been going for six years and theyve been up for decades. but still we are getting emails from people who use wiki to find out about the lancaster/palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.i also point out that the city of lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.please info me as to what more i need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.,0

8251,hi again dearyes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people.and about azerbaijanis are turks or not. despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk turks of west branchoghuzstarted to come but infact it is not important when they came here. the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani and not azeri which is an invented word by persians turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang. as same as turks of turkey. you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see. it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not turk you dont know who you are i know you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean. pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not. about aran as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era. we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep. and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan. aran was part of this big land. but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep. former aran as you called are of my race and we r same nation. you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks. you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves. if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language which does not exist ok lets think azerbaijanis r not turk so what they r? azeri? ok lets call them azeri what is the next step? you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian? or not speak azeri lang.? so what is azeri lang.? where is it? can you learn it to about million people? lets thing pragmatic as well as rational. even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of years ago nor persian.also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. one was paniranist other was panturkist. some of their researches looks really funnyabout the names of turkish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan. if you were here youll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name? ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan. most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian. my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats armenians and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays. they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc. which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk. i dont know what they want us to feel in tehranthe name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well. this word cant change to azarbaijan during history. i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it nowi had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well. the diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know. whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty,0

8278,you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors.under wikipedia policy under the rr rule it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and/or help improve the article. there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors. that is to leave the rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page youll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion without explanation without stating their objections first without submitting their proposed changes to peer review and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreedupon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.,0

8354,i dont want to reopen the issue as the issue was never actually solved. wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic and childrens books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count. instead of just blind reverting changes id like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources. whenever a source is in question it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some peoples bias against editors who arent signed in. these changes were badly needed and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wpowns the article and others who violated wpagf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good. ,0

8420,kanes secrecy?quote from the articleif the allied campaign were to be completed in red alert the allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of red alert . it should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original tiberian dawn manual which states that nod is an african group in its origin making no mention of the soviet union whatsoever.if the instruction manual was written by gdi then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of nod were. maybe kane planted information stating that it was from africa or maybe it really was from africa and kanes attempts to drum up support in the ussr were unsuccessful. regardless it doesnt seem to conflict especially if it could be established that the manual was a gdi document and therefore biased and uninformed.... please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime. either by clicking on that hyperlink or by visiting an online dictionary. the sooner the better to be perfectly honest. as an aside the changes to the section you indirectly are proposing would translate to a classic example of original research. the sections current content is sourced through the referencing of several different publications and statements of various c development teams rendering it fully verified. ,0

8504,roazir fars is the arabic version of pars the iranian name when translated to english is “the gulf of pars” and the english name “persian gulf” means exactly the same thing interestingly enough most gulfs in the world are called like the iranian name for e.g. gulf of mexico gulf of aden gulf of carpentaria gulf of the farallones gulf of maine gulf of tonkin gulf of guinea etc etc so the correct name for the persian gulf should have been “the gulf of pars” just as the iranian name is as for the azarbaijan as both versions already exist on the wiki and we are not inventing a new name i insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. the whole population of rep azerbaijan is less than % of the population of iran let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word azarbaijan like iranians do so why a vast majority should follow a small minority? it is azarbaijan and english speaking people better get used to it,0

8522,what do you consider primary sources in this context? she notes the obvious homoerotic passages in rydbergs poetry and fiction which are primary sources for literary criticism. the details of rydbergs sexually troubled childhood and his uneasy relationship with women were presumably taken from his standard biographical sources. i have no idea what sources svanberg and stolpe used i cant ask them. again no other scholar has questioned the accuracy of their conclusions which seems to me to be the definition of a scholarly consensus.,0

8667,where do you see dennis saying step it up? the only thing close to that is his comment here to bump it up which is clearly referring to drn the wikipediadispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall wikipedia dispute resolution process and it is very clear that userbecritical understands that dennis is talking about the wpdr process because becritical actually refers to arbitration followed by dennis mentioning wprfc/u and wikipediaarbitration. stepping it up and/or bumping it up has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you. nor do any of the other comments by dennis even suggest such a thing be done or has been done. secondly you were indeed at the brightline threshold of wprr with three clear reverts in hours had you reverted again within the next minutes yes its just that strict of a line you could have been blocked without further warning since you been warned about rr several times in the past it was very generous of dennis to warn you. you were edit warring against multiple other editors. and just a reminder that you dont have to cross the brightline threshold of wprr to be blocked for edit warrring so be more cautions and find consensus on the talk page instead.dennis is a fine admin and has been nothing but helpful and nice to you i think you should return the favor show him some good faith and stop the accusations of wrongdoing on his part. ☥ ,0

8716,well lets try again one more time.re commonsenual = wpor. regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation glantz et al. commonsensual is not or. occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete and it is regulated by various international conventions. for instance guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation and one of them refers to something quite unique. therefore we can speak about the occupation sensu stricto and occupation following an armistice. that is what i mean under commonsensual occupation and that is how a reader will understand it.re belligerent occupation i do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way however other sources majority of sources use different terminology. therefore the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. i propose to present both viewpoints you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. therefore it is your arguments that do not hold water.re malksoo please reread his works again. and since both you and i can draw different conclusions from different pieces of malksoos text below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position made specifically for us the baltic sattes were occupied in june and annexed incorporated by the ussr in august . thus both occupation and annexation did happen. the fact of annexation and that the ussr proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own not occupied changed the nature of the occupation if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. for example when moscow olympic games took place the olympic regatta took place in tallinn. this cannot be a typical occupation it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant western opinion and post restored baltic states themselves the soviet annexation remained illegal. in this sense illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudodebate. the annexation since it remained illegal did not create any extra rights to the annexing power the ussr. if the article makes that aspect clear i would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to occupation and annexation of the baltic states. in fact i would recommend such change because it takes more precisely closer to the facts into account the complex nature of the soviet rule in the baltic states.what else do you need? malksoo clearly says that in the case of the baltic states both occupation and annexation took place and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense but not in others. p.s. llegal annexation equals extended occupation. in other words we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the baltic states and i never argued against that. again what synthesis you accuse me in?re there is no bridge between the baltic and soviet/official russian positions there is no inbetween or continuum of scholarship its one or the other wrong. there is a baltic position position of different foreign states which was different from state to state and from time to time positions of scholars western baltic russian soviet positions different during ss and during perestroika and official russian position.re from glantz to malksoo a belligerent occupation. glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the wwii not in the legal aspects malskoo does not consider soviet intervention in as a military operation at all. the only aggressive step according to him was a naval blockade.re baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were colonized probably. however other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the ussr hence extensive influx of migrants. was it possible if they had a colonial status?i expect you to treat my arguments seriously. ,0

8776, stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments. i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information. the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here. there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain. the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group i.e. hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view. hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy. thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons. for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia. this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different. still it is dissapointing. happy trails. ,0

8840,danny your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again. as the wikipedia page says . . .you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets this does not provide as much information to readers but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website and none of the watchtowers multiple links no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. as for the links to quotes websites they are extremely encyclopaedic and the page has no commentary but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage rather than just a few selective quotes. they are all given their source publication date and page numbers for proof and reference. your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing. you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesnt suit your agenda not dissimilar to your religious organisation. i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months you feel the desperate need to hide accurate comprehensive dated quotes direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society? if you can give all the publications from the watchtowers website then im sure many here will be only to happy to list that link but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on . you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site merely saying its not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality and your desperate urged to manipulate the public. posted central august ,0

8856,the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treatiesbaldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections. standfordham wrote to the king on october i saw mr baldwin who in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out? said yes but not on the campbell issue but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns. he sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the governments fall. ... ... and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwins strictures based on the campbell case – at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement achieved at a conference in london on the dawes plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the russian agreement. but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion. two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—middlemas and barnes p. . ,0

8914,...s rantpresently we are witnessing an open war against croatian dinaric culture. croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of conservative hdz party. croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergović refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players. some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all štokavian people and their culture are serbian. however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian. dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljević is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovićs book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje . also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in dubrovnik . even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijović kočan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijović kočan gusle glasnik may p. . dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatović a daughter of famous gusle player ante. although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry. not far from dubrovnik another coastal city makarska – was also a bastion of croatian gusle music. actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players. this mediterranean area also gave birth to andrija kačić miošić th century catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond. to honour kačićs work ivan meštrović the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kačić in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument. in addition to kačić makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music. according to dr. fra karlo jurišić who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banović zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovićkudrić and culminating with the most known mate banović – trliš . as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound. olinko delorko the researcher of dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of hvar. the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. english writer maude m. holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p.this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and hinterland. matija murko the researcher of this literary/music forms had reported that during his trips through dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredečki “hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme” željeznobeč p. now lets take a look at the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc. what do they have in common? of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost extinct. why do we have so few gusle players today ? is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture ? if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre,0

8956,at bat edit warring at matt joyce baseball juan encarnación terry tiffee ian kinsler craig breslow matt guerrier etc.==please dont change at bat to atbat. atbat just redirects right back to at bat anyway. i agree. i agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated. in addition pls stop edit warring at matt joyce baseball ian kinsler craig breslow etc. and add to the list matt guerrier. it is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record. there is no reason to delete it other than your penchant for disruptive edits. kindly desist. it has also been explained to you with proper citations that the plural of rbi is rbis. pls stop edit warring this point. see juan encarnación and terry tiffee. that is vandalism. run batted in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis. obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info.its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  t / c danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap. both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler either make it a subhed or take it off seriously.oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky. in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in. rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint.either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. jackal again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch. as to rbis as xlee pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseball/archiverbis. plus is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention. yet jackals reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s as though the s is incorrect. he has done the same with at bat which he insists must be hyphenated. etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits. it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits. if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits. there is enough good work he could perform instead. well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do . as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one. regarding what uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue. in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists. allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked. jargon overrides grammar. to say that a batter flied out is probably not good grammar either but its proper baseball terminology. i think this needs to be discussed at the project page assuming anyones watching that page anymore. userbaseball,0

9013,whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation. in this case organic remains was added to explain the word they. while w used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils. from the dictionary of geologic terms rd edition by bates and johnson fossil any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time. nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time. and further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.w likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this wp page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future. it is unfortunate that w were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as misunderstand and twist what they said.as much impact as w have had on creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood is now way out of date. modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood. when critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism. ,0

9036,deleted response to comments on wikipedia talkwikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. in this particular case the discussion was started by user brad who made a personal comment about me. now i dont mind this i was more curious than offended but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talknaming conventions ships‎. you claimed that my post which you deleted was a pov inserted into a neutral notice. it may have been a pov about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable. it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting. if you are going to start censoring postings then i would suggest you do so impartially. you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice but merely removed one comment. rather than restoring impartiality this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.far better that you do not delete anyones comments. i would suggest reading wikipediano personal attacks. im not sure what deleting others posts comes under try wikipediaetiquette.,0

9047,first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste. one refutation is more than sufficient. second your rationales appear to be shifting. originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements. now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable. be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy. given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source. i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy. consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues. this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy. this means no specious claims. and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues. can you abide by these conditions? ,0

9149,i didnt malign anyone personally or anyones name. i mentioned the authors name a second time simply to distinguish her from the other sources she quotes in her articles. it is cliffc who pulled the quote from my much earlier and unrelated to the article post bolded bambis name then tries to find fault with me. if i wasnt a big grown up fella myself i suppose from some of the passion in the comments directed at me i might be getting close to feeling personally maligned myself i might even question the evenhandedness of the administrators comments. my sources have been questioned which is fair. i have placed a query on the reliable sources discussion to show my willingness to be introspective and open to other ideas i suggest cliffc post a similar query for the how drywall works article at that same notice board. the bambi turner article has not been provided as a reference for the article the blog and real estate website article she uses as references have also not been posted to support the content of the article. i believe astm will be a reliable source for how gypsum board assemblies are put together so i would like the wikipedia opinion of its usefulness before i refer to it in the article. ,0

9163,i asked you to ensure you were accurate because if you were wrong wpspade i would accurately call you a liar. userbullrangifer made a comment that my alleged use of unreliable sources ... doesnt exactly help your credibility. however this statement was not true at all and has no basis in reality. it was fabricated simply to damage my credibility. he says this despite the fact that i had not used any unreliable sources on the page. his poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. when asked for clarification of his accusation he produces four links. of the four two were posted after his offensive comment was made. therefore i assume he was taking about the first two links that i had already provided when he said it. the first two links both of them were from of newspaper articles from the washington post . yes both of them this person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce more reliable sources that damages his credibility not mine. im calling bullshit on everything he said. for the reasons above i am calling userbullrangifer a liar. chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy. he got his lame comment in before i posted the second two links. those links were for the associated press and government of canada but lots of other reliable places have this stuff. he didnt back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. for this reason is also a liar. thats not all. this person must be the brains of this operation. right here on this page puts forth the argument that and none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory. i think his credibility was lacking prior to his comment about me. its pretty obvious that logical thinking is lacking here too. previously ive called his position the dumbest possible argument for anything ever. ,0

9261,you resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile binksternet.for starters dating back to the original discussion back in december while the user optigan liked financialnorth he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo to which no including paulh or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. as im saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed no decision was made and the discussion ended. paulh or you did not say anything. if he wanted the photo then why didnt he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? i wouldve left it at that then but instead he and other editors remained silent. i didnt restart the discussion because i assumed that the editors simply lost interest or didnt have the time.furthermore i did not slip in as you disgustingly dishonestly facetiously say. i only added that photo because i noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in january. again no one did anything for months. you and paulh cannot claim you didnt see the change because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.again paul did not form a consensus prior to the change or continue the discussion where it had left off. once again he instead changed the photo got a consensus from binksternet. the ip editor liked the photo but quoting the editor againany of the photos in that section federal reserve band san francisco.jpg except would be fine as a replacement and even the cropped version of is better than the one currently there now. thoughts?... talkim going to replace it with and see what happens.the crux of it was that paulh made the change before even binksternet approved it or i or other editors could respond.binksternets abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. despite my reverts i at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were. paulh did not and binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. i dont see binksternet asking the ip editor in question or other editors to the sf article including optigan have their say either in this. he is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus something that at least paulh did earlier. only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me ,0

9308,the author of lotr clearly intended it to be a single book and it was sold as one concurrently with the threevolume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible. the utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books. this is in stark contrast with rowlings books which have been published sequentially separated by years in between them and are considered by everyone including the author and publisher to be separate books entirely. i agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page. i hope we can put this matter to rest now. thank you for your time.,0

9340, some tips for making your stubs a bit better apart from your overreliance on soccerway which isnt always a wprs ive noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. typing player who plays is poor english try to put footballer who plays... or soccer player who represents... the word currently is pretty pointless too i mean they either play for the team or they dont right? also try not to say they play for bayern munich in the frauenbundesliga. put of the frauenbundesliga instead because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. these are just small suggestions but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. thanks ,0

9394,hmmm. i was actually writing a response as you sent yours. oh well. for the record my response was thisresurrecting articles is frowned upon yes. we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change to...the game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article.making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders. certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start. i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article i.e. not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works. if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan. i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same. i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though. the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as – manchester city f.c. season/spurs city or however the subpage is actually named given the / in the name.yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category. i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic. better to do it ourselves i guess.sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and...well better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed. hopefully i addressed all your points. ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak. having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in. generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy. yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play. to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup? in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it. talk ,0

9431,in case it has never dawned on any of you all coats of arms are made up by someone somewhere at some point in time. that is their nature. their purpose is to serve as identifying symbols of the individuals or families who bear them. coats of arms do not fall from the heavens readymade by the hand of the almighty they have to be created by mortal men for the purposes they are designed for. in some countries the designing of such devices is heavily regulated in others such as the united states it is not. but in either case all the coats of arms in existence are created fabrications made up by someone somewhere at some point in time and born by their owners as symbols of their iidentity. ,0

9453,re your ae topic ban appealsorry but it strains credulity mine anyway to believe that you didnt realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are wellacquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save as you state here . recent article/talk page history . you havent edited the article since and you must have thousands of other articles that need improvement on your watchlist. you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard re this as you have for many articles during the past few months.in my view the a.m. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcomingness. the remainder of the appeal in which you speak of wps losses from your lack of participation thats a different story that others can think over. if you remove the a.m. section i shant contest your appeal since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesnt make much difference in the long run. but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. you could either remove that section since it hasnt been commented on there yet or strike it. if you choose not to do either i may bring it up at the ae appeal. id prefer that we keep the conversation here but if youd rather have it on my talk page thats ok by me if so ill post talkbacks.,0

9475, my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion page....l nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear salvioyou have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period.may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az seric and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds.there is a constant undermining of the city´s greek identity i.e. whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army.the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. on the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled trnc.it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture w.r.t the city. the trnc is illegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus. this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character.this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.in the light of all of this i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self. furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory.marcobadotti talk ,0

9499,look a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing but since you two have now discussed the rough equivalent of pages this discussion is obviously stalled. let me try to sum up what i think about this topicplease be aware that wpatt like any other wp policy isn’t written in stone and saltyboatrs extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say.every article published in foreign affairs is reviewed by other scientists which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. that should be enough to make sure wpatt isn’t a good reason to ban them.i have to agree with ultramarine if you use your interpretation of wpatt consequently there’s only a handful of wparticles that would survive the necessary massdeletion of references. what’s more i think it would be some pretty bad ones those that rely entirely on newspaper articlesfinally there really is no good reason why articles that i could use in every political science paper and any scientific article shouldn’t be enough for wikipedia. ,0

9501,words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propagandadamemk you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia.userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not.he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia.how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda.hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources.i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals.i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports.damemk i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkdamemk and usertalkejanev is not the same user. some insight into my user name ejanevthe only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev. it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev.user damemk is a separate user. probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia.it does happen that i am from canada. i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years.and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia.i am not the only user/editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles.you can watch the contributions of specialcontributions/laveol and see that more than % of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes. ,0

9571,for the record larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that universal wasnt going to go anywhere with the galactica franchise. it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on universals part to do anything with commander cain and the pegasus and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis which was built by the th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth. the film would have dealt with the search a major battle with the cylons and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth all w/o involving the galactica or the rtf other than being mentioned.the first article google shows is this one . and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although im not sure about whether theres some wikirule about referencing other miniwikis. the john larocque article on the attempt is at . hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort but seeing as how their site has a lot of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware ill quote it here to save your systemsin the spring of it was announced that glen larson was making plans to bring galactica to the silver screen. impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander larson paired with its producer todd moyer on an estimated $ million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg. the story picked up where the series left off but followed the exploits of commander cain and the battlestar pegasus made famous in the original series episode the living legend guest starring the late lloyd bridges. in the concept commander cains search for the lost battlestar galactica leads him to contemporary earth which according to the story was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar atlantis.special effects were to be handled by moyers company no prisoners dfx utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander. moyer planned to update some of galacticas ships including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkersà la the transformerswhen on planet surfaces. moreover he and larson planned to expand the galactica franchise to include an imax film a theme ride and a new line of merchandise.then as quickly as it had been announced the project vanished from the radar screen. it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues. it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar galactica were still in some dispute. in either case the project disappeared into the ethers.iirc had a page on this at one time but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared. ,0

9583,for daniel casehi daniel. the block is extremely odd. imo there is no real discussion of my activity in that an thread in connection with a siteban. jehochman whom i have some history with floated the idea of a siteban. durova who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of cirt generally badmouths me about abusive sockpuppetry etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by ryulong. i agree to it. then ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. blueboy a new admin that improperly blocked me an established editor as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom i blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. he is supported by guess who jehochman durova and athaenara whom i also have history with and whose wprfa i made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. i can provide diffs for all of this but i want to show you one thread now over at wikinews. durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin luckily takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom here. i invite a neutral admin to do the same here. i have to run now. please let me know how you would like to proceed. thanks.,0

9689, european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not .as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version. now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable. i contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she thinks it is the most neutral one. i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the eu. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included. i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages. ,0

9717,with all respect i dont know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around. i dont think this is the way to make people feel welcome on wikipedia. chussid should not make personal attacks but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history. any normal person in chussids position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed. indeed. and the reasons they give are totally outrageous. these same people do consider which also does not give any names or an address of the persons behind it a reliable source. because it fits in their zionist thinking pattern. jaz does not. if you ever wanted to know what jews who oppose zionism go through you are having a nice view of it right now. incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting. just because youre bothered about something does not give you the right to cross the boundaries of civility. a discussion can be heated and honest without being incivil and thats what we require here. ∇∆∇∆ ,0

9766,because im a pedant like this in response to the last paraphrase from of asburys the great illusion im tempted to call npov here. asbury states that neither pussyfoot nor his associates were punished or even reprimanded further he even states that they were justified. however theres a distinct difference between whether something is moral or justified. anyway im nitpicking. heres the passage so you can judge for yourselfalthough pussyfoot johnsons political operations failed by a large margin to conform strictly to the christian principles upon which the league had been founded neither he nor others who employed similar variations were ever punished or even reprimanded. it was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the lords business anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the almighty. ,0
9767,note that in one case the conversion was incorrect before the vandalism and had been so for a while. since ft/s actually equals m id guess that the was either miscopied when originally put there else subject to earlier vandalism. but these numbers should also set off some red flags for their precision so a reliable source for that number would be especially useful.,0

9865,regrettably i have to agree about the gameplay section. it comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games using mother as an example than a proper encyclopedic entry. i wont quickfail just for this but i do want it fixed before ill pass. id prefer the section to be rewritten entirely but some glaring points followmother is presented in eight chapters with rotating playercharacters including the protagonists cowboy father the family dog an inept thief and abused monkey so is the protagonist not playable? how large is the party? why are these descriptions in quotes? it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. actually why isnt the protagonist named in this section? again i completely understand the desire to approach this from an outofuniverse perspective but only to the point where the prose doesnt trip over its own detachment.mother begins with naming the members of the playercharacters family along with questions of the players favorite food and thing and opens to a pastoral forest village soon interrupted by a forest fire and the pig mask army who impose police statelike conditions on the village. with the fires outbreak the father ventures out to protect his family twin sons lucas and claus and wife hinawa but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. they set out to take down the pig mask army. lucas the games hero does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. the game features a lighthearted plot with enemies like partying ghosts and talking rope snakes. porky a character from earthbound appears as the leader of the pig mask army and is the games main antagonist. in addition other earthbound characters such as dr. andonuts and mr. saturn also appear. why isnt this stuff in plot? the cast of characters does need to be introduced better but jamming plot details into gameplay isnt the way to do that.the second paragraph is better its more in line with what i expect from a ga gameplay section. at least its good until apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor. whats the predecessors battle system like? remember not everyone reading this has played earthbound.there is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles first of all this should start off with a however or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. the information is also lacking though why isnt there a need to grind for experience? i think of this as one of the central loveitorhateit jrpg mechanics and im curious as to how the genre might work without it. imagine reading a pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed which is unusual for a jrpg without giving a brief overview of how the pc and day care systems work thats how i feel reading this. and lets the player see their magic psi power abilities viewing your abilities probably isnt a necessary gameplay detail but why isnt there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? and do they have uses outside battle like hms rock smash secret power and softboiled do in pokémon?while mother s music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new it features similar sound effects. by completely new do you mean it isnt recycled wholesale or that the style is somehow new? also this bit probably doesnt belong in gameplay.if youre up to rewriting this which i encourage especially if youre shooting for fa id recommend a structure like the followingparagraph its a topdown jrpg theres an overworld you explore towns with your team of characters yada yada yada.paragraph there are battles theyre not random with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles is it like in pokémon colosseum where you only fight other trainers or like in dragon ball z buus fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them? this is how the battle system works this is how items work this is how experience points/leveling work again how is this the case without grinding? or is a different system used entirely?.paragraph your team consists of suchandsuch a number of characters they change with different events in the story characters do/dont return once they leave here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.stuff like items and saving can you save anywhere? work in wherever you want im not picky. september utc,0

9881,that was me. i struck it late last night my time at the end of a big edit but didnt want to start this discussion and then sign off. it shows up the synthesis nicely. eugene compared to you i know nothing about this stuff. i came here because it was mentioned at fringe theories and it looked interesting. i thought i might learn something. i have a moderate level of interest in the early church. ive read crossans essential jesus historical jesus and jesus a revolutionary biography robin lane foxs pagans and christians and the unauthorized version robert millers ed. the complete gospels annotated scholars version funk hoover jesus seminars the five gospels ian wilsons jesus the evidence a. jesus michael goulders a tale of two missions robert eisenmans james the brother of jesus and elaine pagels gnostic gospels cant lay my hands on it for the date. not very closely and a long time ago. so my knowledge is general. i am relying on you and others for the specialist information that will make this a good article. what i have brought here is a critical mind and an understanding of policy honed in editing a few medical articles where precision clarity and neutrality are crucial. when i called this article crap the other day i was judging it on those criteria. it is not clear and not neutral so i doubt its veracity as will anyone with half a mind who reads it. it is a bad article. if you want it to be good or featured i recommend you welcome me sv and the many other good editors who come here. it could be at ga in two weeks.,0

9894,my reply to the revert issue hello kailash. you asked me the reason for reverting your new upload of and let me tell as it is my duty to inform. firstly you didnt inform me that you are going to upload a new version to the existing poster and you did it. kailash you are a creator of various good articles and uploader of various images in wikipedia with respectable barn stars to your credit and a user with great goodwill and respect among fellow users. should i tell you that your act amounts to vandalism in general ? shall i tell you that even you upload in good faith it will be assumed as vandalism only ? being a honest wikipedian how many times you could have reverted edits showing vandalism ? i didnt specify this because it is a general practice and moreover it would look a bit odd that a user like you indulged in vandalism. so now i think you got your answer. hence i am going to revert back without any reason specified there. still if you revert i will remain silent as i know that you didnt understand me and you are not the same inspiring and honest wikipedian i met during the merging of eega and naan ee. regards,0

9951,wikipediarequestsforcomment/historyandgeographythe following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. i trust that philip gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute. rossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam. these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed. one external link links to an article about the th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood. another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. it seems to me that this philip gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for rfa is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam. id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr. gronowski. i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. thank you very much for your consideration. ,0

10058,im in twothree minds over this proposal. as regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic ive seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a wprs is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards. on the third hand we do get some nohopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as nonnotable. in the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking thats why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as i can tell. andemu ,0

10189,===belated merry christmas and hello from a few submissions on contradictions in indian history pages thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages=dear tiptoetyi request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by user dinesh kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.this communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of wikipedia and nothing else. it has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of wikipedia pages whatever we do users like dinesh kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from pov websites etc. just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the chalukya empires especially with reference to the chola empire pls. also remember that in wikipedia for god knows what reason the pages on the chola empire have been christened as chola dynasty despite that the fact that the cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in india but also overseas including sri lanka maldives very large parts of south east asia for at least years of their existence. here are the examples but before that i would like to say this that deliberately user dinesh kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the chola empire saying that the chola territories were taken over by the pandiyas which has a great weakness the chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from onwards and between / to their kings were displaced and the kalachuris under bijjala i and bijjala ii ruled kannada country in india. the chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just years between to after which they went into oblivion. i request that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the cholas whose kings from ad though were not as strong as their kings between ad yet one of their last great kings kulothunga iii on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied madurai karur and sri lanka then known as ilangai between ad. he ruled for around years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty having hoysalas as his allies. yet even with weak kings following him after the cholas lasted till when their last king lost to the pandiyas and the cholas went into oblivion. contrast the above i.e. the demise of the cholas in or to that of the chalukyas who were first of all without a capital for over years and reemerged for just years and became history by ad or thereabouts. yet jingoism seems to get the better of user dinesh kannambadi and he has written in the western chalukya empire page as under the link is and the relevant portion of text is the following“this period saw the fall of two great empires the chalukyas of the western deccan and the cholas of tamilakam. on the ruins of these two empires were built the kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of deccan history for over a hundred years the pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile chola empire.”though technically speaking at least as per the version of dinesh kannambadi the chalukyas fell and demised in / and the cholas demised after almost decades in about /. i.e. within a hundred years of each other i would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression ”this period saw the fall of two great empires” i mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other then the expression could be a little contemporaneous but even as a weak empire the cholas lasted till almost years after the chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the chalukya dynasty which went into oblivion in the year or ???? the point is that whether it is mentioning the hoysalas another kannada empire or the chalukyas he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the cholas.. even while mentioning chalukya architecture user dinesh kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the cholas see this write u,0

10195,list of ice hockey teams in ontario i updated templateohl and templatedefunct ohl to try to simplify things. templateohl contains all teams past and current for the ohl. templatedefunct ohl contains all past teams from the omjhl and the oha junior a. that template may need to be renamed. regarding the article list of ice hockey teams in ontario. how should we handle the defunct teams from the ohl omjhl and oha junior a? that is a really good question. i would like to add them as it would allow the list to be both complete and consistant with the others. i havent added defunct jr a teams on any other article but many of these oha jr a teams were the highest level of junior hockey at the time i believe so should be added as being equivalent of majorjunior. however that will likely make this a really long list. it might make sense to split the article into two active and defunct as i did with the baseball lists. i would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets then deciding from there. if we hope to get it to featured list status as i would like for all then we cant use the template as a part of the article itself.,0

10219,the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. i would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. i.e. “situational factors such as luck compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like i mentioned above. maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words i.e. change “social perceiver” > “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. instead of a “in the real world” i would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. this would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. overall i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate. aside from the few things that i’ve mentioned i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting.,0

10270, wikipediaarticles for deletion/cheongye kwan your post at the above afd on a new martial art bothers me. this was the version at the time that you based your post on. you posted i just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines... it is reliably sourced... since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied... it now has independent sources. and to refute the argument posed by wayne it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised.please consider the concerns this post raises. simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin. in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. i dont have a word for it. unreal is close.the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability. the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website. a casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny < sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too. the lau philip la interview. entries marked reference and support of written reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence. a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper.in brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal i think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited and/or written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall.your assessment of these at afd was it is reliably sourced{ style=borderccc solid px width=% there is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts. probably via selfpromotional input. there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.} that the cited pages are evidence of notability{ style=borderccc solid px width=% they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it?} that the sources are independent{ style=borderccc solid px width=% are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host} that the cites show it is nonlocalized{ style=borderccc solid px width=% the page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it. the reference openly stated cambridge university and bristol taekwando a big indication of its actual source when a link was provided on request it turns out it,0

10274, im not even sure what you mean when you stated just trying to help make you piece sound better. do you mean your piece? if so this isnt my piece. its an article written from the contribution of many editors. i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify. secondly you didnt just change a phrase. you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting. if you read the entire sentence its somewhat redundant to add that. and finally theres nothing unprofessional about the term railroad. in fact its actually a better fit. if you look up the definition for railway youll find that its often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances. we have no idea if thats true or not and therefore railroad is actually preferred. ,0

10419,the afghan government may not reward the death penalty for prostitution but the afghan people do. this article is to explain about prostitution in afghanistan so it should cover every thing including how afghans view it or feel about it. historically afghanistans people lived according to their local traditions. each region has their own local rules that they abide by and much of the country hasnt been governed by a central government. in the south and east of the country i doubt you find a single prostitution service because that area is tribal society and they follow taliban style rules.,0

10778,== cohanim j eleazar phinchas zadok == agree. dr. karl skorecki have the final word about cohanim genetic signatures. he more than anyone else is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about cohanim genetic signatures not jheald. he was the one who discovered the cmh in . after years he came out to announce in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. katz kaplan rappaport shapiro kovacskonh are all j. those surnames and families are the most prestigious cohanim families today. they are all cohanim j. j cohanim is much more common than j cohanim. skorecki reported that pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j this is a very important information that confirms matematical historic and genealogy facts. phinchas was the son of eleazar. itamar was his brother. out of the cohanim houses did belong to eleazarpinchas while only came out from itamar seed. eleazarpinchas j had a much larger population than itamar. all cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses until the destruction of the second temple. so if phinchas is the origin of all cohanim j than it makes sense since his cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother itamar. so it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two cmhs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of cohanim. all genealogic tree for cohanim since aaron until today are still divided into these two houses eleazarpinchas and itamar. during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim —preceding unsigned comment added by ... whaaaat{during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim}lol +dplease stop being stupid and be realj if for real jews arabisraelites decent ...and j is for goyim jewsfalse jews... agree. dr. karl skorecki of the ramban/technion medical center in haifa who is renowned for his discovery in of the kohen genetic signature reported in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j he suggested. the extended cmh is established for j cohanim only. if somebody in j also has cmh then he is likely to have cohen ancestry. j cohanim form a tight network around cmh. but this is not the case for j. the cmh does not apply to j. if a j is in cmh it tells us nothing about one being a cohen. in j the cmh has no special status. the j lineage of cohanim in cmh could be much more recent. jewish cohanim in j form a much larger network around cmh than jewish cohanim in j do. cohanim jews belong mainly to haplogroup j because cohanim as a group jj have a high frequency of j. the j cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor according to the observed mutation rate which is three times faster than the standard effective rate. j cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly jewish caste jj. “the finding of j among contemporary cohanim can lend credence that today’s cohanim jj may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to phinchas as the founder of j cohanim” concluded dr. karl skorecki.why the confirmation that phinchas may be the orign of j cohanim is so important?“pinchas son of elazar son of aharon the kohen turned back my anger from upon the children of yisrael so i did not destroy the children of yisrael. therefore say behold i give to him my covenant of peace” numbers . “god gave to pinchas a new permanent priesthood for him and his descendants for all generations.” zohar hakadosh a. god indicated that phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counterintuitive form of blessing an allnew form of priesthood. he is given the divine covenant of peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. zadok a des,0

10805,as far as presenting sources are concerned the book the life and exploits of alexander the great sites much more sources in detail than source which i think refers to some sources already referred by others. as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps perhaps not. as far as the author is concerned in my understanding he himself suggested that the story of alexander that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat to these countries then we must not look for the original alexander story. similarly we must not look to the states of greece for it because at the death of alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. one country only could be the birthplace of the alexander story and that country was egypt... i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the alexander story from egypt as authentic which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding. this according to me forms one of the essence of the alexander story and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i dont have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins. at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the alexander story from egypt and not his fanboy fantasies from greece to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.,0

10867,anyone have any thoughts on the addition of bernard lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians? since augustine aquinas are listed and lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers i thought he would be a good addition to the list. his work is wellregarded in th century philosophy he certainly has the credentials and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle augustine and aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see insight a study of human understanding. there are lonergan centers at boston college university of toronto seton hall and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. im quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable.my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so thought i would throw it out there. ,0

10877,well there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarnos words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia uk etc. but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the gs forces and those loyal to suharto. im of the opinion that the period of combat was brief and that after jakarta was seized by nasutionsuharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence why the pkis central committeein exile called it just a white terror. but of course however the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to maos peoples war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict. hence i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations.by i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to reestablish the party. unfortunately it is without copyright information printed this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the u.s. cold war. i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war. at any rate toodles. ,0

10890,outdent how about looking at it like this. rpg rulebooks are just that. the rulebook explains how to play the game but it is not the game itself. the isbn manual you reference below supports this games shall not be given isbns. there may be some confusion in the matter but one good example is found by harking back to ad nd ed. to play that game required it being rules heavy that really is pretty much true a minimum of two books—the dm guide and the players handbook. neither contained the game and the game went far beyond what was in either. the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books magazine articles supplements pamphlets online articles and what was in the head of the players. the book is about the game it is not the game. for that matter a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn so you cant really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn. a publisher doesnt mean its a book as board games computer games and any number of things are published and have publishers. ,0

10903,alex thank you for your reply.i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion.regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat. that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later. there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page.the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland. it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion. and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine. note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep. i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system. 連絡 見学/迷惑 ,0
10904, a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi. lately ive seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man. i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people. he seems to spread his antipolish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazism in europe and racism against poles. he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation. thank you so much for taking care of him and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. however now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different. this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of nazi germany war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi crimes against the polish nation invasion of poland collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazism and race untermensch master race white supremacy racial hygiene nuremberg laws aryan race aryanization aryan paragraph honorary aryan white nationalism holocaust victims racialsegregation nazi germany persecution of black people in nazi germany occupation of poland – polish decrees kidnapping of children by nazi germany forced labour under german rule during world war ii extermination through labor antipolish sentiment antislavic sentiment polish question polish joke ahnenpass anschluss lebensraum rassenschande adolf hitler nazism racism scientific racism themes in nazi propaganda germanisation reverse racism relations between nazi germany and the arab world glossary of nazi germanythis guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or nonaryans by the nazis. in fact the only aryanlooking poles that were accepted by nazi germany at the time were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like .% of the whole nation. the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the naziruled nation and were treated only slightly better that the jews. this guy he spreads lies all across wikipedia therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions diannaa. if youd need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed just tell me. i will also try to patrol the articles about poles. ,0
10905,a slight difference with youi have to disagree with your comment above that some of bbbs actions border on censorship. no some of his actions epitomize censorship and although i am generally quite reluctant to call for administrative procedures against anyone and am not at all knowledgeable about such procedures i think we need to get the ball rolling in this case. as my late dad would have said the guys an utter bird. nobody editing on wikipedia should have to deal with this little napoleon nonsense. ,0

10928,parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know betterdear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing. she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it. i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section. she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike. not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you.to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in. then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version. is that soapboxing??to use another example closer to home. lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail? like he clearly said here under the desperate? heading heeeeelp. and then he also bizarrely? asks gregalton help him delete references to like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism? can you believe it? i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this. the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll. he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. it made me realize that were going around in circles. we improve the articles to the point that they look great. then they get screwed up again. so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery? it could help people who arent educated...the idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his. the guy is mad. if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation. then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing. zenwhat is clearly a piece of work. check out the dudes talk page. in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana. so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking. what a comboseeing this i ponder my options. i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better? versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions. for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the eight? people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page. it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing. is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines? this is like watching evolution in reverse. i carefully construct a page with the help of others. it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos?. instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0

11034,good lord. i mentioned the clusterfucked bureaucracy but i did not anticipate your adherence to it. you deleted my post and it was regarded as vandalism when i tried to repost it. one of the editors which removed my information was on trial for being a bot. im not sure what edit war you are referring to other than my own additions to your page which you state at the top that you welcome. your immediate removal of my edit was very suspicious to me as it seemed pretty authoritative. are you on the edits to marmaduke subscription list? i dont understand. i do not think i am acting like a child. if childish behavior to you is using bad language then call me a a child i suppose. i did not call you any personal names and only referred to what i thought of as a hierarchy on wikipedia as a clusterfucked bureaucracy. i can call your edits an ego trip which they increasingly seem to be as you want to talk to me like i am a child even calling me childish. it seems as if you didnt even consider the several links i included in my last post inculding npr. i am trying to tell you that i made a reasonable edit to a page one that i made before and which lasted several months before i noticed it was gone tonight. you assertion that i am willing to bet no one will show you more sympathy than i will is further proof that this process is an ego trip for you. if users are all equal than i would prefer it if you left me alone. my edit is not inflammatory and included a link to the website. if needs be i can include all of the links i provided on your page if that is enough to validate my claim that marmaduke explained is a relatively popular blog. if all users are equal then why does your designation of my writing as nonnotable brand me with vandalism when i attempt to repost the content? please explain yourself.thanksyournumbertwofan,0

11070,not at all you are making a straw man argument here. i never claimed odonohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position which is exactly what the quote says and also something odonohue agrees with. again i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd. the disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do. at the end of the day it is a value judgment as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement. if we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis. ,0

11196,undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. see archive . the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign . hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. the relationship if one can call it that between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright. many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but obamawrighttucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life. if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article. there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also. picking out just hagee to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight. this article is about mccains whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant. if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about mccains campaign which has a couple paragraphs about hagee. in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut. right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on mccainfeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s as compared to more about hagee.,0

11444,dear wikinews wikipedia since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise and/or contribute. for example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia? this is a conflict of interest. another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including “blackpearl “svtcobra” “chris mann” and “whoville” own disney stock have gone to any disney theme park watch disney movies and/or buy disney products? then “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest. does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses? then this is a conflict of interest. what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” don’t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates? as documented volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards. thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.wikipedia and wikinews editors dont follow wikinews own written polices... “do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news. you even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion. you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue. wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it. incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims. are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well? they proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such. wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute. its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating. yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control. if you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more.. does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?,0
11445,oh hey a response. thats cool. i personally feel that having the fortitude to call out ttn on his obvious flaws should warrant a few dozen barnstars but i see where youre coming from. if you insist on keeping the block i would like to formally request the reason for this accounts blocking to be changed to reflect the real reason instead of being noted as a common vandal. maybe a reason along the lines of being a pain in the ass like that one guy on nakons talk page stated.on that subject maybe he should be blocked too after all he did use a cuss word and thats technically worse than anything ive ever said. ,0

11459,=colorb>coldplay expért lets talk this talk page is for discussing the article not world war ii history in general. summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences. my edit stating that as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement. this is not stalins arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the abraham lincoln brigade. prior to the francobritish assisted nazi sudetenland grab relations between nazi germany and soviet union were icy. when the nazis were declaring war on czechoslovakia the ussr was hard at work putting together an antinazi coalition. only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked antislavic aggression did the soviets begin to look for other allies. there is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event. this is not a motive its a statement of facts. if there are no more objections i will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect. respectfully disagree. the statement as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically. one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antihitlers coalition. another school believes that the only stalins aim was the alliance with hitler. the third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory. the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars. we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. we have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources hitlers occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr uk and france and could lead to signing of antihitler triple alliance. in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. had chamberlain and stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had ribbentrop been little bit less active wwii could be this is not a motive its a statement of facts. no. all these facts had already been in the article before your edits. your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote. in addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. try to follow this unwritten rule. that saves a lot of time and efforts. as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events. what nick said also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia ussr would have intervened as well. ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia. ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert. after the seizure of czechoslovakia the ussr held the uk partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the french as allies. if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

11581,you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources. this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions. brian krebs a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog krebs on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up. ... then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer ... and ... iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions ... proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics. it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided. and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company. contributions talk ,0

11586,i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of töbel here it comes dear val who is also a mormon or a parrots aint surei found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. i think that the person concern storm rider is grown up enough to do so on its own. unless next time i am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. it could be interesting. if you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to dont know what to say. so do the wisest just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand. all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light. i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. as for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie what about you? are you val? or are you rama? or are you dgl there is a lot of nick name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name. they are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous. so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo i will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.so what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own? i had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and i dont feel to make it again or take another. following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees hahaha and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule? it is all a lie. how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? it isnt equality it is power struggle. it is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here. wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equalityha ha make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic. for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first. i speak languages english danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek of them fluently the others as pocket use. like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm. as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. in europe from age we choose between languages english german and spanish at age we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew. to languages are part of the compulsory pensum. i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in india. that was for learning,0

11610,it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre but i was trying to correct and add some information about him. i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a prolefebvre position as well. i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre. the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that. both men tried to derail the second vatican council and fought both john xxiii and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way. i dont know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george iii was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant. and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council. why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church? it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity. i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while he didnt exactly what his grandfaters reasons were but he said it probably wasnt hard to guess why.even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article. thats why i added the tag because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction. jun utc,0

11714,managing the content of articles when a plant product whether food or other is not in a relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem. here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach theres bound to be some overlap with genus/species articles. this article seems to me about right in its focus on what englishspeakers normally mean by banana namely the food where it comes from what it is how its grown etc. it would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to musa genus perhaps with some crossreferencing so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic but this would be a marginal change. ,0

11725, utci dont think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written . the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others for a direct and definite compensation wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.for instance in the light of holocaust in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention but was taken to a tragic extreme. likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker if it is a profession has shown to conducted wholly for business gain i.e. higher profit larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain often to the detriment to the business e.g. accountants in the enron scandal. i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition and one that is couched in more modern language. talkcontribs november,0

11730,as posted at regarding a suggested wikipedia regrets the errors regarding the according to format for information cited regarding mediation. this most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why i requested this user be blocked. in addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the nccc article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder. you can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless. ill renew my call for a permanent user and ip range block. loverofart coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature. administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and i assure you that they are out of the norm for the project. i encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation. if you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken. philippe talk ugly personal attacks you approve??good morning philippe. the post above yours by loverofart is typical of his posts in my direction. an ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the national civilian community corps by posting false and misleading information at the wikipedia website.if your / wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that i enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with him/her while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. a responsible adult a real editor should have interceded long ago.he/she and the others working over the nccc text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase according to does not belong at wikipedia. as i read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me. it would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case.i appreciate wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. i am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the wikipedia site. your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.a pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues i raise or the attacks on me.pull loverofart out of this situation and i will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the nccc site. i refuse to have further dealings with him/ ,0

11823,not tactics. you create a page about a nonexistant subsiduary change all the links and then complain when things dont go your way. you created the chaos and then demand that others fix the problem that you created. you stuffed it you fix it. pretty simple in my book. things were pretty good until you invented the bmw motorrad subsiduary and changed everything. now that it has been shown that you were wrong you blame everyone else for the chaos caused by your arrogance. maybe returning things to how they were before you broke it would be a good idea. oh an apology would also be good,0
11824, can there be a more concise listing? the listing of other inventions is profoundly vague. why group different categories together? why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources? there should be a much more complete well managed list of chinese developments which ive yet to find along with how these were transmitted globally and whether or not places like europe got them purely from the chinese.this really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise which i guess is somewhat there when needhams work which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles.and besides why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under other inventions? who developed these independently?,0

11896,hello barto. i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it? as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left. these are terms both i and ron himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights. i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details.however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article. i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr. gostick. the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him. this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridges document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for.i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself. i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him. i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs. there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense. an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gosticks page in case he didnt know it existed. be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later. one was a recent highlevel member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it. living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone. feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish. do you have a wiki email or a private one? ,0

11908,fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in . by the name fc citizens vardar the club won championships from till . about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together. each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal. how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup. the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents. the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as republics but yet without a nation those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions . in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and vranje prvinces. these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships. in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for the ww the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league. after the ww the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in . the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s macedonian republic league was transformed in to macedonian first league. so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level. its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side. serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues. they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league. they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition. for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information. second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship.,0

11966,all of those statements need to be referenced. leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information. to point out one thing ill bring up consolidated appropriations act . first it has a number of tags on it the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag. second the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that. it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link. its possible that some came from this as well i cant tell. ill also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic so the article is riddled with grammatical errors mostly incomplete sentences. on creation the opening read consolidated appropriations act h.r. is a bill passed to the th united states congress ive never heard this usage to rather than by and assume it is incorrect another editor changed it the lead is also missing an important determiner. in any case you can take a look at  vesey ,0

11988,=wolfram===a hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it. such bodies do not reflect light and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be selfluminous. all blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium. however the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength known as the planck law cannot be predicted using classical physics. this fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics. wolfram referenced to eisberg r. and resnick r. thermal radiation. § in quantum physics of atoms molecules solids nuclei and particles nd ed. new york wiley pp. .i think this also supports the must emit part of the definition. ==,0

11999,nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time. the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it. he/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed his/her mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on was on him/her not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago ... decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that. does or add clutter? sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt he/she even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about / of the entire article dealt with norman schwarzkopf an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaith/goodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles. he/she was involved in blocking input to the article. why? was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying. i dont really have time for this. i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles. i could pretend this user didnt do what he/she did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense. i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative. as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles. the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. also i dont recal ever having called him/her a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently. his/her behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems. i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper he/she isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english. i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon. nothing new under the sun here. if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all. i know whats going on. i dont know why but i dont have to and i expect the motivations arent interesting. respond if you have anything to say. ,0

12007,reconsidering st paragraph edit?i dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that im sure that the data are necessarily wrong. rather im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject. i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement. in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. a. benjamin cardozo a. learned hand b. john marshall harlan b. john marshall harlan iithe question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? i think not.perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale.at a minimum im questioning this edit? it deserves to be reconsidered. ,0

12014,addressingwhile indian tribe is official us govt lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur dalene people once inhabited acres ha in northern idaho and washington and montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur dalene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties idaho. you dont have to use my wording but you see how i am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined. .  boomer second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. id put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway? keep the chronology clearer. interesting that the coeur dalene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm from a very cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter. the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case.,0

12020,first off modern computergenerated ornate renderings of the paleohebrew yhuh/yhwh and modern hebrew tetragrammaton were added in the article anyway. mine were of anthropological resources my friend prof. james greenberg university of phoenix anthropologist.the w in yhwh was not intended to represent not of the yod as the ancestry but of the ancestry of roman w back to the aramaic u and then the paleo y.the transliteration of the en vowel u whether a u vowel or ǖ vowel instead of vvor w consonant and the better pronunciation. for example ability for pronunciation of the greek letter upsilon changed in soundvalue from a u vowel to an umlaut or frontrounded ǖ vowel was relevant to the tetragrammaton as far as the representation by many that there are no vowels in the tetragrammaton. and third yahusha as in the same tetragrammaton of yahshua ref. strongs concordance sha for deliverer and shua for scream or cry does existed in hebrew so is not completely bogus as a supposed historical divine name... anonmoos talk ,0

12029, more description of location please? hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is? i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful. i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. what do you think? any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful. i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you. thanks and best wishes ,0

12042,response to the disappearance of madeleine mccanni reverted your edit because you give partial information not because of the wording i prefer. what parts do not make sense? the ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? stop saying it is bad english if it was just that youd fix it without removing information.garcia added that when the pj is criticized then the british police are also criticized because of their close cooperation what you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the portuguese article it is not just close cooperation it was created a joint working group right from the start with the british police. this is why the british police are also criticized. just close cooperation they have with the interpol the europol and other police organizations. no working group was created with them. i hope it is clear. several unfair critics were made to the methodology used by the portuguese police. garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by portuguese and british police. other facts indirectly related to the different methodologypersonnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as forging evidence he gonçalo amaral was the victim of personal attacks by the british media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman but also attacked him as a human being. portugal has unsolved cases of missing children under including madeleine.in spite of all the resources available and the different methodology the uk has unsolved cases of missing children under in the last four years.national missing persons bureau. it seems that the british methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. besides thisthe uk has a serious problem with child trafficking a serious problem with african children that just go missing no criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the control risks group hired by the mcanns since may. the investigation of the pj weve stated all along has the most likely chance of us finding her something made them change their minds?the use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with childrens abduction and trafficking that the uk has. i hope it was clearly written and the parts of it do not make sense start to make sense.i am going to revert the edit you are welcome to correct any bad english not the information.i am sure my portuguese is better than yours. ,0

12369,march utcyes the presentation of god and cosmology in tub is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. if one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way i can think of to describe it npov. npov though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship origin and unusual unique presentation that has caused various types of pov to surface in debate true not true religion philosophy etc. i searched in some online libraries at the library of congress and even wrote to the urantia foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. so far i found it listed under scientific religion religion nonfiction cults and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the loc. the book itself says it is an epochal revelation which is the fifth to the planet. it describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding god deity and divinity. religious science scientific religion esoteric cosmology religious cosmology what? perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article while increasing it at the same time i think. what are your thoughts? you know if we wrote that the urantia book is an epochal revelation containing religioscientific cosmology... there would then start more pov debating. ,0

12387,i was requested to provide an opinion here by comfykem. everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both and thats sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. however theres no reason in principle why each cant have an article as long as there is sufficient distinctive reliably sourced material in each to merit that. this appears to be the case here just about though bloating the lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful. if we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species as plantdrew suggests it would probably be best to have it at the species name as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.,0

12439,okay i disagree with this just as strongly as i disagree with attempts to say he wasnt jewish. firstly marx didnt kill anybody nor did his ideology. a bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people. and given that the german people managed to produce some unquestionably german people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people im not going to weep for the fact that the germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century. beyond that marx was born and grew up in germany with a very limited connection to his jewish ancestry. his primary language was german and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works. although he spent most of his later life in england ive never really heard that he didnt always consider himself to be a german id think in fact that living in england would have accentuated that. while i do think that his jewish background is important and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a jew his german background was substantially more important than his jewish one. his own works emerged out of posthegelian debates within the german philosophical community and his greatest influence throughout his life and for several decades afterwards was in germany where marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of europe britain france and russia in particular had their own nonmarxist socialist traditions that were not assimilated into marxism for a long time if ever. marx was german of jewish descent. being an internationalist is a statement of intentions for the future of the world not of present day identity. ,0

12456,there are many inaccurate statements being posted here. far too many i dont have time to correct all of them. the bnp was modernised by nick griffin and has no links to holocaust denial or nazism. digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant. you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories. during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that? another example the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis. so they went from being antidrug to prodrug. the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial. secondly the comment about nick griffin and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antibnpers. what nick actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden. likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the nazis. also the last claim modern bnp members sieg heil i presume was a comical claim. it has no basis in fact. bnp are strongly against nazism and fascism. if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. is that democratic? you might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently.,0

12478,you said i am determined that the page will not regress to this again and i will delete anything inappropriate that jeopardizes the good progess that is now being made. a completely inappropriate post in the middle of a sensitive discussion threatens to do just that. the problem is that you are not the sole arbiter of this or any talk page. the post was innocuous and did not violate the conditions of the arbitration decision. nor did it affect the flow of discussion on the page. in fact the most appropriate response would have been to just ignore it. by removing it you just encourage a reaction. you accuse me of wikilawyering which is absurd. the guidelines are there to help us all. however not only do you violate that guideline but also several policies. it is this kind of heavy handed action that encourages people to persist with problem edits. it is a longstanding convention that we do not remove other users posts and in my three years here i have never seen it done when it wasnt vandalism. unless you can give me a much better reason for not doing so i am going to reinstate the deleted text. ,0

12565,elellandhello humusi am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot. i m very inexperienced with wikipedia. i was enthralled by wikipedia. initially. that is until i met eleland. i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland. eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted. he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.the article was on ed oloughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent. the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. he was amongst the candidates for this years dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.so i studied eleland a little.ive looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict. more than were directly antiisrael. his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the proisrael side. in this way he has undermined many many articles.personally i dont care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc. i think there is a problem.wikipedia is i am afraid beginning to read like eleland wrote the script.who is eleland? what power does he actually have?can anything be done?adon emmetif you post a reply here i will contact here or even by email,0

12592,the lead is quite unbalanced as it is supposed to be a brief summary and introduction to the main text and yet / is about historicalculturalreligious aspects of circumcision which only occupies a small portion of the article itself. i agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section perhaps as the opening paragraph but given there are already articles for religious practices it is unnecessary in the lead. it could be reduced to one or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision but without going into detail. this is a medical article and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision. only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice.,0

12813,new louisville definitionsince the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government. first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. if this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left. second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. third even if suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says. the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city. your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. what you are referring to is the louisvillejefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisvillejefferson county. both are defined separately by the census bureau see here. this article is about the consolidated louisvillejefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated. the confusion lies in the census bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures. although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings. the census bureau has accepted the louisville/ jefferson balance but not the city/county consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses. because of the acceptence of the lou/jef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.your assertion is not entirely correct. the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisvillejefferson county in their estimates. they also include a separate figure for the balance louisville/jefferson countykentuckya louisville/jefferson county balancekentuckyathats from the estimates the last number is the estimated population. this article is not about the balance however. issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page. actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is and not anywhere near . what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed? i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio. we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as or so when the census lists the population as . i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same. however that cannot be done here. an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed. there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article. please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation. since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — userstevietheman,0

12900,articles ive just deleted the bugrr team or however that was spelled and notice other deletion requests on other articles here. i also read your note on that articles talk page and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of wikipedia. we only allow articles on subjects that are notable generally this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple independent reliable sources. that means that a company thats just recently started that has never produced a product and that by the way those were written seem closer to a group of friends is not a suitable subject for a wp article. basically if you cant find a number of newspaper etc. articles discussing the company it shouldnt have an article. i hope this explains why these articles were deleted.in connection to this i need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type. continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators and these are clearly nonnotable companies so much so that we used the expedited speedy deletion process.,0

12911,shockedi am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an eb account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information. that opinion took a nosedive today when i came across this article in wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection. if i want to find out about bose headphones or any other product i will go to their web site i dont expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia. one can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader. the fact is i dont care whether this so called article is written from a npov or not whether its balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not i do care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if its a fact it somehow deserves a place here. i can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that i dont want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list.,0

12926,== unblock requests =={{unblock reviewed=sorry for my blurb here i went in detail elsewhere. if an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology they will notice that ive been patient while i had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. that creates a very stressful situation. please see here for outside opinion. i did not use the same kind of language against hrafn and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while i added content to the article. i was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it even before the afd process. i noticed it was a stub and started to add content. how am i being disruptive to other there when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? i even listed potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be an editor of astrotheology and add content. hrafn on the talk page even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. it is obvious he was against something but that something wasnt me like he thought and he couldnt believe otherwise or choose not to. somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment i got from hrafn to where durova stepped in and it went directly to arbcom. she did ask about pastordavid but i looked and i left evidence on an/i of why i didnt accept his offer that is not a refusal to dispute resolution that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an afd. i felt another mentor/mediator would be best. personal attack/comment redacted by if you look however i did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to hrafn about rs/n over the physicotheology book... he didnt answer at all to that question but he went on to despise me instead with more egregious misintrepretations. as for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that durova noted those werent because of disruptive editing. i never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. if you seriously think i did it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. the previous mediation was recommended by a mentor comments redacted by i hate the show the mistakes she made also we arent allknowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? the computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why i got blocked before. after unblock the consensus continued and it still sustains today. if i truly was trying to disrupt like durova claims dont you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. comment redacted by it would be a test to see if she requests unblock but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again i really doubted her olive branch. i deleted a section here on my talk page of her vanish forever bit. i simply did not reply to her comment redacted by you can argue all you want that i changed the section title which policy does allow for neutral view comments redacted by when arbcom said this is obvious i truly dont think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help offer to help mediate. i saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides pastordavids. however i sent an email to ask her why... why.. why..... but now she is calling it obscene and offers to show it to any admin. if you read itcomment redacted by like i said on an/i...decline=reason — not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words the gd word primarily to his opponents. i see no reason to unblock. the consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle and the community has handled. june ,0

12934, dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. this isnt a list of people who kinda sorta theres a small chance maybe are transgender.the ones who crossdressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it. the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is guan yin. the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something e.g. military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered.the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too? also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact.and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to ed wood? you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them. that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.maxwell klinger wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army. anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality. whats the association between the two?also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here. ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. june utc,0

12992, may utcas far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore. thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the crossover connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology. as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe only star wars takes place in an entirely different futurepast element basically a universe that predates that of the earth. and tolkiens universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm the same applies to dungeons dragons world of warcraft and warhammer. however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c.s. lewis and hans christian anderson/brothers grimm. harry potters world also doesnt tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen. and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tiein is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesnt the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present. perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole. piecraft ,0

13017,again i disagree. scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness particularly for the question of the roma and the disable. in fact as you go through modern academic literature the last years holocaust more and more includes nonjewish victims. just an example alex callinicos from york university the holocaust isfor good reasons i need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. all the different kinds of domination fused together in auschwitzracism directed at jews slavs and roma the economic exploitation of slave labour the oppression of gays and women the persecution of dissenting minorities such as communists and jehovahs witnesses. or slawomir kapralski identity building and the holocaust roma political nationalism. i have already mentioned sybil milton who was a senior historian at the research institute of the us holocaust memorial museum and henry friedlander a leading holocaust historian in the usa is another important voice. this increasing consensus has had an impact on common language as well on political bodies. see this press release from the un for instance. it is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist mordern project and the common fate of the victims. the famous pictures of mengeles twins are of roma children. the technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the t. the tactics of eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of poland against polish leaders. i have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of jews in the holocaust i have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.if this is not enough let me try in another way by deciding to describe the holocaust as an exclusive jewish event wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate i could say on the declining side of an ongoing scholarly debate. this is not holocaust denial with no legitimacy in the academia and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes. at very least wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead ,0

13028,annual murder rate per million indians in india = all australians in oz= indians in oz=. the official explanation for the higher rate for indians in oz compared with all australians is that they are much more likely to be young and male and about half of all violent crime involves young males. unofficially i would point out that if you eliminate indian murders by indians in oz then suddenly the difference gets much smaller. so it is pretty damn simple indians murder each other wherever they are. please do something about it if you care.,0

13055,well in case anyones interested in following up on this further using the la trobe university online search engine a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ truncated to allow for various inflections leads to bjt record hits at least of which are in the pali canon. heres the first page of the search results with links to the subsequent pages as well . of course this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term nor what this term means in the context of various suttas since multiple records can be part of a single sutta. similarly this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term etc.. fwiw a quick review of these results potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words e.g. netti peta one in the abhidhammas kathavatthu once in the visuddhimagga and times in the pali histories. if nothing else this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by peter and myself might possibly be among? the core texts. with metta talk ,0

13097,patagoniai see that you are an argentina editor for wikipedia i am an editor and historian from chile. how can you send me this note quote this is nonsensical. are you saying that the boundaries of patagonia are to be defined by a xixth century map? or maybe from the territories supposedly roamed by tehuelches? not now of course but k years ago when it would be impossible to talk about tehuelches properly??? oh come on. please bring on reliable sources and serious data to contrast. ianvs talk unquote how can you say this also send me notices and messages everywhere my work on patagonia for wikipedia is edited you edit again and threten? here we are not trying to take any part of patagonia from argentina what we are trying to do is to clarify the chilean patagonia northern boundaries with historic citations geography and well documented it is all written and it is all in history books and you will not change it via the web or because you are from argentina and think to be an authority in patagonia matters. leave our chilean matters alone we do not discuss about your internal affairs. also be brave and answer in this media and all the post you have posted agains me or my articles with solid evidence in what you are trying to say.,0
13098,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory. it cant because langan is not a member of academia. but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable. for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions.byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. this is correct. to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions. however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral. unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal. he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself. by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu. this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well. oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously. ,0

13230, musings hey fridaywhile blocked the past two days i read through your subpages. things like /admin etc. they are greatim burning out on this project editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past ive received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me. i also saw that im not the only one whos been on the receiving end of this. ive seen it all but its too long to go into here. im not sure if these are new trends or just something i havent spent the time to look into before. mere editors really have little recourse in this. filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past. it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an outofline editor. filing against an admin would i assume be much much worse. admins seem to behave like innercity police with their wall of silence.a lot of your comments show that youve noticed the same happenings. in an ideal world i think you are right people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen. i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies. we need to define what something like disruption is. when someone is blocked for a personal attack the diff should be included. that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change weve tried the trust admins to do what is right. it has failed. ,0

13272,hitler was innocent... there are several groups that want to rewrite history to make germany the innocent player. a particulary fine example of this nonsense is .some of this article reads a bit weasily that germany was on the back foot and had to attack.i particularly note that the article stated that hitler made a peace offer before the battle. i changed this toon october he may have made some type of peace offer to both western powers. any statement along these lines needs to be made very carefully what were the offers and what are the sources for the information.,0
13273,hadnt seen that. a lot of material to cover. i am getting an education. but ill be be plain. there has has been a lot of quotation mining on this page from various povs. it is what directed me to start reading talk in the first place and to decide to start editing myself. good wiki pages demonstrate a synthesis of sources. it is easy to spot when that is not happening particularly if you have ever been involved in collaborative writing before. a few quick reference checks on the stinkiest stuff such as grover whitehurst appearing to skewer david elkind proves that it is happening. all subject matter aside i detest this. if someone takes the time to write an academic article or produce a journalistic piece or enter into a public point/counterpoint debate others who want to reproduce their thoughts have a moral obligation to summarize the original source authentically. criticism of it is obviously fine but only after the original piece has been accurately summarized. imho. ,0

13279, i already know the map from john speed but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoye/suraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors. the deutschen dont call themselves germans germanen or alemanes alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word suryoye/suraye was mistranslated into assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists. do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the th century and in their own words which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity? the syriacorthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate suryoyo with oromoyo in their own words. interestingly the arameans from maalula who are either christian melkites or muslims call their aramaic language/dialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoythaaramoytha which is a result of greekchristian influence on the arameans. the word suryoyo which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites catholics or melkites. nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. even if the word suryoyo derives from assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name. ,0

13347, good policy suggestion on class assignments. my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. i think your looks like a good idea and i support it. its especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced thoughtful edits to psychology articles here as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. keep up the good work. talk an appology is in order dear colini am not sure if you will have the chance to read this or if youll have a moment to respond but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article. however before i go any further may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. i will not try to make excuses for my actions nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them. i realise and no doubt others will too that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t. and most importantly i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. though i can understand where you are coming from i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the longrun. i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge please do not blackout our privaleges to use and edit articles. let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school. looking to make this a better placecivcodex thanks. we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia. what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate. talk · contribs · email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page. °talk proposed new policy id like to advertise this very draft proposed new policy . comments please. °talk i think the central dillema is this a student could make a poorquality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. if the grading rubric was accurate a student would receive or negative credit. my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment increase their wikipedia knowedge and improve the grading rubrics themselves. im fairly proud of education programsaint louis university/signal transduction sp which i helped write. you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re how the community reacts to profs and students. the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies in the first place and we are often more unkind than necessary in the second. i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt. –  + barnstars { style=border px solid gray backgroundcolor fdfferowspan= valign=middle rowspan= style=fontsize xlarge padding verticalalign middle height .em the barnstar,0

13372,well arthur i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what says it is not your correction. it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless.you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. so lets do that.we want a function f satisfying f=e and fn+=expfn defined as widely as possible. we observe that n= and n= present no problems f= and f=.to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as .and we want f to be continuously differentiable. the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on . this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because a=e.next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f is monotone on the interval . from the functional equation fx = ln fx+ we get f x = f x+/fx+. hence f =f /f=f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx = expxexpxx.thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and .,0

13493,xenodontlikeit typically when xenophrenic sees a valid edit by wiki policy that he disapproves of for whatever reason he seeks to get others to remove it. this strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance or needs the proper context or isnt the full story etc. there are many different reasons used but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense > to ratio in his pov that average editors cringe when they see it. xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced pov version can only stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. this leads to edit warring over days and even weeks articles often get locked down. some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. some call this tactic a form of wikiterrorism i say it shows that xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent not a terrorist even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.,0

13602,tangential forces the tangential forces coriolis and euler can be applied to a system but they dont occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism but that is off topic.during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two.we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like. the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained corotating radial motion.in a rotating frame of reference with nonuniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially.in a keplerian orbit there will be zero tangential acceleration although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force.having said all this tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. the centrifugal force is an outward radial force.more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the radial distance variable.they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.,0

13637,thanks for the speedy reply and the links. after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit perhaps in a table form that can be added too or removed as needed rather than a vague catch all description.for example after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldnt be done alone. aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. im not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didnt really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.,0

13687,=== page is in rough shape ===with the recent purge of content the page is not as informative as it once was. the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed. one editor may appear to hate since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog. also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog. meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content. for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work and the link to reciprocity is not online and the topic not a major issue. both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available.in order to be bold i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content including from sources that are not government funded. basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening. barring this broadened content eligibility we all need guidance for what is eligible content and perhaps what makes ineligible. the content there was written in and has been adopted whether independently or without attribution by other authorshere is the major recent deletion . specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced. some of these can be sourced elsewhere but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy dont spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do. basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients or find and punish abusers. basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions such as social security in the us is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation. balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work. better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up. smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction. viewed this way the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation. social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically with less requirement on charity and welfare. it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income. its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner. natural finances definition of social dividends variable basic income tax revenue surplus over social program expenses essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic productivity and automation growth. the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.,0

13770, please remain civil. you may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article. you keep conflating my changes with those of someone else. the use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and i didnt make that change. you keep reverting all changes wholesale including changes made for reasons purely of style rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you. we have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that bradley manning is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action. you complain about blp but accepting claims about bradley mannings guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious blp policy violation. until the claims of lamo and the us government have been established in a court of law we cannot use the wordofgod to state their claims are true. as for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted. we are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted who clearly states that mannings treatment amounts to torture. ,0

13780,this sort of information belongs to pages like human trafficking in the united kingdom or slavery in britain and ireland. however user ankhmorpork is hellbent on adding this content not only to this page but others as well check out his edit history and thus reveals his agenda. there are several pages about racial groups on wikipedia and none of them contain such content. for example millions of such crimes are comitted in the usa every year but not one of them is mentioned here . this is blatant povpushing.,0
13781,dunfermline article and new pictures for the kirkcaldy collage hello again. ive been looking at the paragraph about the kingsgate shopping centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the s specifically between and if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years. but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway. about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources.also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference kingsgate extension on schedule for august opening by mivan. as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status. thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the kingsgate and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date. that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to mutt luckers home page. it is now on his talk page if you want to see it mutt lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the beveridge park pond. as well as this i have another new picture of the old kirk tower which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website the clock has been restored since that pic. and would like to upload it.,0
13782, bloc voting countries with large populations of nonnationals may have their televote influenced considerably. this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia. this is fullblown crazy. what does nonnationals mean? these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa. people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries there are some refugees in each of those countries but that doesnt really explain why croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to serbia or macedonia to serbia where there was no conflict to speak of. for example im a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual. but im not a bosnian nonnational. i have the passport of bih and my family has never lived in serbia in history. its really about mutual intelligibility which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. its the language and sensibility.,0

13785, colorado balloon incident greetings. i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon. unfortunately wikipedias use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts. its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia. refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article. wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents. the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. ive been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.i hope i havent given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as i do especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. thanks for your contributions ,0

13800, note the current lead implies israeli aggression against hamas by stating that israel killed several hamas members in khan yunis on july and hamas retaliated with rockets. i have been trying to seek consensus for including the israeli claim that hamas started firing rockets circa june at drn. however it may also be worth noting that israel maintains the hamas members killed in khan yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as israels deadliest attacks in which six palestinian militants died though israel denied any involvement...the israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern gaza area of rafah on the egyptian border where the hamas gunmen died. military spokesman lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into israel. it turns out the same account was given by the new york times when hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives there...hamas blamed israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation. hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an israeli airstrike is not an assertion wikipedia should parrot uncritically. ,0

13880, i feel like i cant improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved the person i said it to and who did the block hours after the conversation was over. if as said that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong. when i posted that message and i still havent heard from the block admin that its content was the issue i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal human to human level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person rather than having us both resort to the standard drawnout wikiprocedures. so far at least onwiki that editor has had no reaction to what i said while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions and me only able to appeal on this page.,0

13900,i understand your point. i simply do not believe it to be valid. during the period in question the rc church did not have large armies at its disposal. it relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. in france louis a loyal catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. the rc church at this time were also opposed to this principle one that has become so widely accepted in western societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before. louis with the tactic support of leading churchman ordered acts of antiprotestant terror. lets be completely honest without the tactic approval of the church would a devout catholic have been committed to such a course of action? some leading churchman celebrated the outcome a france almost completely cleansed of protestants. now in all the material the criticism of the rc church is so obviously implied that this shouldnt need reemphasising. a modern historian would not write the following is a criticism of the rc church... that is how junior school children begin their english composition answers ,0

13904,skywriter i have tried to be civil with you. i would ask that you return the favor. remember i didnt even write the old lede i picked that as merely being most likely to be noncontroversial. also note that on every single edit page theres a big statement saying if you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it. part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing. its nothing personal.if you see no evidence that kinzers book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran then you did not read the book or the reviews.amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is merely how good one is. but whatever you didnt include a direct mention in the most recent version so lets just drop this. and for about the billionth time since you mention in my edit summary that im criticizing kinzer.... im doing no such thing. im sure the book is very good judging from the review given by the cia history fellow. but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself. people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong so this was not a new revelation.aggression aside snowfire the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address. if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording feel free to bring it here for comment. i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede and now its a windy analysis. got it. but aside from sniping you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing. it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede. there are a million and one possible sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede we have to pick which ones. i have no doubt that your text was sourced it doesnt mean its automatically appropriate for the lede.yes and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. fast and loose with factslet me say it again are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup? do you realize what references are for? its to confirm facts. this fact is obvious and supported by every source including your own so it doesnt particularly matter what it was referenced to. if you want to source it better have a blast but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts.albrights apologyyouve got a point that the linked nytimes article doesnt call it apology. remember i didnt write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than wed like.the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup. however the cias accounting published in three years after the publication of kinzers pathbreaking book must be weighed against the cias destruction of most of its documents related to this coupwait the cia destroyed the documents so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it? that logic doesnt flow. more to the point the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source. i havent read all the shahs men but from your linked book review the one by a notable person not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that too i quote..eisenhower and his secretary of state john foster dulles were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscows machinations.kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen.by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. lastly mossadeqs naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh partys efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions. he seemed almost blithely unaware that prosoviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe. by not reining in irans communists he fell on washingtons enemies list. ....yeah. as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source. also note that dulles is described as moralistic i.e. interested in stopping the communists not greedy / interested in oil. squares with what i know of dulles anyway.the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol,0

13937,just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.in some cases it is probably appropriate and actually used just like a surname in a legitimate but different broader sense than that used by our surname article and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere by the person. thats probably especially true of radio personalities with an onair name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name ive seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names. but as a general rule no. some like annmargret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. the problem of course is that our articles especially the stubs and substubs often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on. if it is mary lou or something of the sort common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself it should clearly be under m in any category the redirect which should be there or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful. but in between there is a huge variety that youll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories and there are lots of them. even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesnt even appear in the articles own name. ,0

13939,as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to. it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in not polesti. raf bomber command used an attack by the af to attack this target.the days loses were as already given. specifically spitfire claims were not discussed so the spitfires percentage of the kill total is unknown which is conveyed in the article.more importantly citations have been given for for the order of battle figures. your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. oob are given in lists as you should know so your give me a quote tone is rather silly. caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. he gives known strength returns. as for total german day fighter strength again this estimated by caldwell as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete. he points out and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september . in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time while alone were available for combat in the west. german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time. even considering that all e.f fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts negating even the med. theatre. so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false. ,0

13953,how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? also just because a word has a historical meaning doesnt mean that it cant ever mean anything else as culture develops. the word rap meant to knock as on a door up until the late s for example. would you deny the more modern use of the term? the english language has no board to regulate it as french does with the lacadémie française so you have no basis for defining what the word means. we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like youre and your for example but none such for words like bukkake. if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way that is valid. my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier gay just as there is no need to call men having anal sex gay anal sex but thats really irrelevent. i think it is important to make clear the historical implications but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything but specifically semen and specifically onto a persons face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it. ,0

14015, august utcdear the hour block that you placed on my account yesterday for personal attacks has just expired and while i must say that i was not happy about the block i harbor no hard feelings towards you. if you check my previous contributions you can see that i have been a productive editor on wikipedia. id just like to let you know that while i was guilty of personal attacks against and i was goaded into doing so by these two individuals. in order to avoid future blocks i promise not to engage in anymore personal attacks and if i am goaded by trolls such as these two individuals i will simply ignore them. was repeatedly reverting a comment which i made concerning statements made in the hugo chavez article which i found to be biased. my issue with concerns his nastiness and uncivility. he is far too possessive of articles which he has created and he becomes very angry when edits are made to such articles. after multiple revisions of legitimate edits which i made to his articles i told him to leave me alone. he proceeded to foul my discussion page with unwanted and unsolicited comments. when i objected to this he goaded me into calling him a profanity.while i respect your role as a wikipedia administrator id like to respectfully request that in the future you exercise better discretion when blocking a user based on onesided information. thank you for your understanding ,0

14165,agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. i was concentrating on the polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the czech experience needs to be included. czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s had closer ties with the west than poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was the west politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with poland. that said i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland the baltics yugoslavia or even ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea. while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war i think that the articles focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. after all there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union too who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy. oct utc,0

14175,neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published reliable sources. this is what you have quoted me? unfortunately that is not helpful. i appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion. my frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point. i have clearly laid out why this is not a pov piece and still not a single user has proven otherwise assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long? is that really a legitimate argument or is rjensen simply offended that i have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge.giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held view i am sorry you think i am in the minority. is the same conclusion reached by the world health organization aap cps dermatology associations worldwide and anyone who has actually objectively reviewed the literature and the tactics used by the industry. for people to say that i am in the minority perhaps in the court of public opinion but isnt that how propaganda works? there is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda this is not even open for debate. but these people are seriously compromising the integrity of this website by acting like gods claiming they know more about propaganda than i based on health information and an industry that they dont fully understand. i can by the way generalize about the industry as it is represented by the jcta which is the organization i cite in the article. on what basis cna they do this i ask all of them? and they suddenly become sensitive and cite wp ... and claim i am the one who is personally attacking them?,0

14225,kurdistan?kurdistan is not a geopolitical region. theres a region called kurdistan in iraq. theres a region called kurdistan in iran. theres no region called kurdistan in turkey. thats akin to placing an algeristan in france and making an article that treats it like a country. there are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. kurds are a minority in turkey just like the hispanics in usa or algerians in france. as ludicrous as it would seem to place a mexicistan or algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in it is to list a kurdistan that includes turkish territory. as long as we dont declare san diego mexicistan which mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a rippedup treaty claiming it it is equally ridiculous to list kurdistan in turkey. in iraq a country that was set up by the british merging territories a region called kurdistan warrants an article as the kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. but i call bs on turkey being listed under kurdistan as turkey does not have a region named kurdistan and kurds are turkish citizens not living under a kurdish state like in iraq whom prints their own passports and such. ,0

14244,indeed “learning curve.” i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully off i wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like arbcom’s wiki. that wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path. that took some reading and trial error. mediawiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan. it’s—like—about openness. ♬” the thing is those who don’t care to think about security wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing. however those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by i.p. then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what i did to file. like many things i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki. moreover installing imagemagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using ftp it’s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like templatext template template/doc templatehilite templatenbhyph templatenowrap and templatext. i think i have all the gottahaves now. i was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so i’m fond of them.i can’t complain about free stuff. mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $. i’ll take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day.,0

14253, trimming sounds fine but where a dispute comes up i would recommend slowing things down. focus on one or two specific quotes and if someone reverts instead of immediately reverting back try to come up with a compromise version. ditto with the other person reverting instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version try to come up with a compromise. with each person changing each others work rather than reverting it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. also use clear calm and neutral edit summaries referring strictly to the article and not the editors. in terms of refactoring what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to. when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or hes just always stubborn then thats getting away from discussing the article content and is veering off into discussing the editors. better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors. good habits to develop though they can take time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your. also avoid naming specific editors in a post as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive and then they may miss everything else thats said. instead when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done diff the edit without mentioning the editor. like i disagree with this edit diff as i feel its a violation of policy/guideline. a better way to handle things would be suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this but i have seen that using this kind of thirdparty discussion technique can work wonders in deescalating disputes. it also tends to make whoever is using the technique sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful even if offwiki they may be hopping mad. it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action. when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute and they see everyone yelling at each other the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong. the admin wont care who started it theyll just address things as they see them in that moment. but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly and one editor being uncivil then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption. caveat just because one editor is being uncivil doesnt necessarily mean that theyre in the wrong. but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all theyre doing is namecalling rather than actually discussing the article then thats a problem that an administrator can easily address by removing the nonconstructive editors from the discussion. onka ,0

14255,i think wikipedia does have an obligation of respect and we do selfcensor quite a bit. we can show selfrestraint and respect and yet show the community what they want to see such as photos of the garments. there are no nude or seminude photos on other religious articles why start here? if a photo needs to be shared let it be current and without a live model or at least a model with a face why are they so ashamed to have their faces in the photos? ebay and flickr more have up to date photos not these from the s or s. this is completely offensive to the bulk of lds readers on wikipedia protecting the page is not the answer to keeping an image on it rather lets find something that the community can agree on and this current version it not it and undoubtedly as cogden stated end up with continuous vandalism of the page. ,0
