10011,biased unreliableemotionally written by armenin wiki editors==pls stop using the wikipedia for your dirty propaganda and lobbying purposes. there was no genocide. this is a amyth advanced by the armenian church and armenian fundamentalist fascists. a nation can not be subject to a egnocide when it has several heros for whom you can see statues in yerevan irevan. jews dont have it. the resolution is the act of some sold congressmen who want to appease the armenian lobby. it has no reliable valid and neutral content. it is kjust a piece of dirty and lie facts presented and written by christian missionaries working to kill turks and kurds in s. you can claim to be subject to genocide as much as you want. but this thing did never happen. some armenian fundamentalists and fascists who were killing kurds turks and azerbaijanis were killed by great sons of the turkic nation and i am proud of them. go and propogate your lie as much as you can. you will achieve nothing. raman==,0

10015, wester civ hello i had gotten an email from one of western civs fans asking why they dont have a wikipedia page. i remembered that there had been one at one point in time so i traced it back to you. i am not an active wiki user so i do hope you forgive my lack of knowledge on how this works. i have read the reason for deletion and i have also read all of the criteria that must be met by a band to be considered notable. if i read the deletion log correctly i see that the reason for deletion was listed as expired prod borderline dbband that said i am including as references in this message links to their three published albums a list of press garnered and links to some of their fan pages online. if you google the words western civ the band is the second and third return on google. i do believe that these elements are all examples of notability as wikipedia defines it for music. since the page western civ is simply being used to redirect people to the western culture article at the moment i do hope you will reestablish this page to its original form as a wiki for the band western civreferenceslink to western civs published workslink to western civs media press kit which includes of over published reviews and articles about western civ as well as a partial list of fm stations that are playing western civs musiclinks to western civs websites please let me know where to go from here. ill be looking forward to speaking with you further.thank you manager western civ,0
10016, is this a press release? ==with her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname nuclear wintour.im sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims. who has widely praised her? who says she is important? and the word reportedly reportedly by whom? where is a source for her nickname? is her pageboy bob really trademarked?also the followingshe is the eldest daughter of charles wintour editor of the london evening standard. her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era.so she was a newspaper consultant? i find it hard to believe that her fathera grown man would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone. where are sources for this? i guess i will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow. if anyone wants to help please help me. i have only read paragraphs on this wikipedia page about anna wintour so i am wondering what else needs to be fixed. i will read more tomorrow.... well you could have asked me per the template at the top of this page. everything in that intro is repeated—often in greater detail in the article—and sourced to the best of my recollection. the general rule is that we dont footnote something in the intro section unless its an extraordinary claim like the most ... the oldest ...—that sort of thing unless thats the only place in the article it appears. see wpleadcite. ==,0

10189,===belated merry christmas and hello from a few submissions on contradictions in indian history pages thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages=dear tiptoetyi request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by user dinesh kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.this communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of wikipedia and nothing else. it has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of wikipedia pages whatever we do users like dinesh kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from pov websites etc. just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the chalukya empires especially with reference to the chola empire pls. also remember that in wikipedia for god knows what reason the pages on the chola empire have been christened as chola dynasty despite that the fact that the cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in india but also overseas including sri lanka maldives very large parts of south east asia for at least years of their existence. here are the examples but before that i would like to say this that deliberately user dinesh kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the chola empire saying that the chola territories were taken over by the pandiyas which has a great weakness the chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from onwards and between / to their kings were displaced and the kalachuris under bijjala i and bijjala ii ruled kannada country in india. the chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just years between to after which they went into oblivion. i request that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the cholas whose kings from ad though were not as strong as their kings between ad yet one of their last great kings kulothunga iii on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied madurai karur and sri lanka then known as ilangai between ad. he ruled for around years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty having hoysalas as his allies. yet even with weak kings following him after the cholas lasted till when their last king lost to the pandiyas and the cholas went into oblivion. contrast the above i.e. the demise of the cholas in or to that of the chalukyas who were first of all without a capital for over years and reemerged for just years and became history by ad or thereabouts. yet jingoism seems to get the better of user dinesh kannambadi and he has written in the western chalukya empire page as under the link is and the relevant portion of text is the following“this period saw the fall of two great empires the chalukyas of the western deccan and the cholas of tamilakam. on the ruins of these two empires were built the kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of deccan history for over a hundred years the pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile chola empire.”though technically speaking at least as per the version of dinesh kannambadi the chalukyas fell and demised in / and the cholas demised after almost decades in about /. i.e. within a hundred years of each other i would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression ”this period saw the fall of two great empires” i mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other then the expression could be a little contemporaneous but even as a weak empire the cholas lasted till almost years after the chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the chalukya dynasty which went into oblivion in the year or ???? the point is that whether it is mentioning the hoysalas another kannada empire or the chalukyas he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the cholas.. even while mentioning chalukya architecture user dinesh kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the cholas see this write u,0

10195,list of ice hockey teams in ontario i updated templateohl and templatedefunct ohl to try to simplify things. templateohl contains all teams past and current for the ohl. templatedefunct ohl contains all past teams from the omjhl and the oha junior a. that template may need to be renamed. regarding the article list of ice hockey teams in ontario. how should we handle the defunct teams from the ohl omjhl and oha junior a? that is a really good question. i would like to add them as it would allow the list to be both complete and consistant with the others. i havent added defunct jr a teams on any other article but many of these oha jr a teams were the highest level of junior hockey at the time i believe so should be added as being equivalent of majorjunior. however that will likely make this a really long list. it might make sense to split the article into two active and defunct as i did with the baseball lists. i would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets then deciding from there. if we hope to get it to featured list status as i would like for all then we cant use the template as a part of the article itself.,0

10219,the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. i would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. i.e. “situational factors such as luck compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like i mentioned above. maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words i.e. change “social perceiver” > “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. instead of a “in the real world” i would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. this would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. overall i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate. aside from the few things that i’ve mentioned i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting.,0

10242,ekantik do you believe that sathya sai baba can miraculously transform his genitals? i would appreciate an answer.i also find it amusing that ekantik of all people is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by sai devotees when ekantik is a hare krishna congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord krishna literally manifested seperate human forms married seperate women copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. sanjay also believes that lord krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord vishnu a male transformed himself into a woman mohini devi. so it appears that ekantik and sai devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. i cant help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.funny how ekantik and andries critics of sathya sai baba want to promote well sourced stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference written by a doctor in a well known sri lankan newspaper is not well sourced. this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions. good luck wikisunn. you see what you are up against? talkemail ,0

10270, wikipediaarticles for deletion/cheongye kwan your post at the above afd on a new martial art bothers me. this was the version at the time that you based your post on. you posted i just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines... it is reliably sourced... since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied... it now has independent sources. and to refute the argument posed by wayne it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised.please consider the concerns this post raises. simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin. in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. i dont have a word for it. unreal is close.the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability. the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website. a casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny < sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too. the lau philip la interview. entries marked reference and support of written reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence. a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper.in brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal i think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited and/or written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall.your assessment of these at afd was it is reliably sourced{ style=borderccc solid px width=% there is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts. probably via selfpromotional input. there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.} that the cited pages are evidence of notability{ style=borderccc solid px width=% they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it?} that the sources are independent{ style=borderccc solid px width=% are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host} that the cites show it is nonlocalized{ style=borderccc solid px width=% the page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it. the reference openly stated cambridge university and bristol taekwando a big indication of its actual source when a link was provided on request it turns out it,0

10274, im not even sure what you mean when you stated just trying to help make you piece sound better. do you mean your piece? if so this isnt my piece. its an article written from the contribution of many editors. i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify. secondly you didnt just change a phrase. you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting. if you read the entire sentence its somewhat redundant to add that. and finally theres nothing unprofessional about the term railroad. in fact its actually a better fit. if you look up the definition for railway youll find that its often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances. we have no idea if thats true or not and therefore railroad is actually preferred. ,0

10351, the importance of khalifman...and of anand ponomariov kazimzhinov and topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for fide...cannot be overstated. they represent the rule of law the functioning of the world title cycle at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle as it had been from onward. to say that fischer kasparov or alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of khalifmans title reign. one could say that fischer kasparov and alkehine were stronger than euwe and smyslov too...but that doesnt get us anywhere. we dont rank us presidents by reputation we list them all equally yes? khalifman himself in in interviews said that although he was not the strongest player in the world being th by rating...he was clearly the world champion having won the title in the open public cycle run by fide. that stand that position is what makes his title reign important. btw before anyone denigrates the fide title champions ...it should be noted that at least two could be considered supergms anand and topalov and that one anand regained the title via the classical method. chesspride ... ,0

10384,i dont want anything in this article that isnt specific to rushtons book including generic comments by gilwhite that dont address rushton in particular and certainly not his book. just because gilwhite mentions rushton elsewhere in his book does not justify putting a completely separate criticism of race theories in general in section to devoted to criticism of his book. if you insist upon putting in generic critiques against race in general ill insist on putting in references that defend race in general. people come here not to read about the race debate in general but about this specific book and the response it got. i have no problem with the native american argument if it can be cited as a critique against this book but for now its an orginal argument composed by wikipedia editors.,0

10393,justin vaisses opinionthis relative absence of frenchamerican political and social unity helps to explain antifrench sentiment in the united states. french historian justin vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward france in the united states is the small number of americans of direct french descent. while he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of antifrench sentiments he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. vaïsse contends that by comparison the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. he proposes that as france has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it it is socially and politically acceptable in the united states to express negative sentiments of the frenchpierre verdaguer a turnofthecentury honeymoon? the washington posts coverage of france french politics culture society vol. no. summer . just to answer ive read before that the proportion of french descendant in the us is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the new world at the same time as the brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly they were mixed into the mainstream america. however its true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they dont represent or try to represent. ,0

10778,== cohanim j eleazar phinchas zadok == agree. dr. karl skorecki have the final word about cohanim genetic signatures. he more than anyone else is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about cohanim genetic signatures not jheald. he was the one who discovered the cmh in . after years he came out to announce in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. katz kaplan rappaport shapiro kovacskonh are all j. those surnames and families are the most prestigious cohanim families today. they are all cohanim j. j cohanim is much more common than j cohanim. skorecki reported that pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j this is a very important information that confirms matematical historic and genealogy facts. phinchas was the son of eleazar. itamar was his brother. out of the cohanim houses did belong to eleazarpinchas while only came out from itamar seed. eleazarpinchas j had a much larger population than itamar. all cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses until the destruction of the second temple. so if phinchas is the origin of all cohanim j than it makes sense since his cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother itamar. so it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two cmhs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of cohanim. all genealogic tree for cohanim since aaron until today are still divided into these two houses eleazarpinchas and itamar. during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim —preceding unsigned comment added by ... whaaaat{during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim}lol +dplease stop being stupid and be realj if for real jews arabisraelites decent ...and j is for goyim jewsfalse jews... agree. dr. karl skorecki of the ramban/technion medical center in haifa who is renowned for his discovery in of the kohen genetic signature reported in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j he suggested. the extended cmh is established for j cohanim only. if somebody in j also has cmh then he is likely to have cohen ancestry. j cohanim form a tight network around cmh. but this is not the case for j. the cmh does not apply to j. if a j is in cmh it tells us nothing about one being a cohen. in j the cmh has no special status. the j lineage of cohanim in cmh could be much more recent. jewish cohanim in j form a much larger network around cmh than jewish cohanim in j do. cohanim jews belong mainly to haplogroup j because cohanim as a group jj have a high frequency of j. the j cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor according to the observed mutation rate which is three times faster than the standard effective rate. j cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly jewish caste jj. “the finding of j among contemporary cohanim can lend credence that today’s cohanim jj may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to phinchas as the founder of j cohanim” concluded dr. karl skorecki.why the confirmation that phinchas may be the orign of j cohanim is so important?“pinchas son of elazar son of aharon the kohen turned back my anger from upon the children of yisrael so i did not destroy the children of yisrael. therefore say behold i give to him my covenant of peace” numbers . “god gave to pinchas a new permanent priesthood for him and his descendants for all generations.” zohar hakadosh a. god indicated that phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counterintuitive form of blessing an allnew form of priesthood. he is given the divine covenant of peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. zadok a des,0

10805,as far as presenting sources are concerned the book the life and exploits of alexander the great sites much more sources in detail than source which i think refers to some sources already referred by others. as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps perhaps not. as far as the author is concerned in my understanding he himself suggested that the story of alexander that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat to these countries then we must not look for the original alexander story. similarly we must not look to the states of greece for it because at the death of alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. one country only could be the birthplace of the alexander story and that country was egypt... i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the alexander story from egypt as authentic which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding. this according to me forms one of the essence of the alexander story and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i dont have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins. at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the alexander story from egypt and not his fanboy fantasies from greece to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.,0
10806, randroide answers to next step guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation.i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software. i do not want that happenning.could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided?. thank you. randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something...of course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there. come oooooon boys start writing that section. i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me. but remember npov and sources all the sources. just like me citing el país in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb. cheers indeed a good point. and all the remarks in cope too. and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo. i agree with you % larean. what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely pov as is much of the rest of the proposed article. also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not. you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits... section.if you have not subscription to el país i am sorry but that´s your problem. my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el país and many many other publications and books. that´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss it´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.do you see?. the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources.btw if you write under a randroide answers section you areinvading my space. i do not mind really. but you are doing it.risking new truncations on your messages. to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections.if you think that the proposed article is pov work in it to make it npov. the article is not mine. ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short. the issue is not whether i subscribe to el país its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the articlevery funny southofwatford. i am going to follow this joke of yours.please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know? there is always someone without this or that book.delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home.delete all the references in spanish because did you know? there are users who know no spanish.it´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really. i had a good laugh.usersouthofwatford how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre. equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response. ,0

10867,anyone have any thoughts on the addition of bernard lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians? since augustine aquinas are listed and lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers i thought he would be a good addition to the list. his work is wellregarded in th century philosophy he certainly has the credentials and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle augustine and aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see insight a study of human understanding. there are lonergan centers at boston college university of toronto seton hall and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. im quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable.my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so thought i would throw it out there. ,0

10877,well there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarnos words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia uk etc. but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the gs forces and those loyal to suharto. im of the opinion that the period of combat was brief and that after jakarta was seized by nasutionsuharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence why the pkis central committeein exile called it just a white terror. but of course however the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to maos peoples war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict. hence i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations.by i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to reestablish the party. unfortunately it is without copyright information printed this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the u.s. cold war. i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war. at any rate toodles. ,0

10890,outdent how about looking at it like this. rpg rulebooks are just that. the rulebook explains how to play the game but it is not the game itself. the isbn manual you reference below supports this games shall not be given isbns. there may be some confusion in the matter but one good example is found by harking back to ad nd ed. to play that game required it being rules heavy that really is pretty much true a minimum of two books—the dm guide and the players handbook. neither contained the game and the game went far beyond what was in either. the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books magazine articles supplements pamphlets online articles and what was in the head of the players. the book is about the game it is not the game. for that matter a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn so you cant really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn. a publisher doesnt mean its a book as board games computer games and any number of things are published and have publishers. ,0

10903,alex thank you for your reply.i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion.regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat. that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later. there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page.the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland. it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion. and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine. note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep. i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system. 連絡 見学/迷惑 ,0
10904, a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi. lately ive seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man. i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people. he seems to spread his antipolish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazism in europe and racism against poles. he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation. thank you so much for taking care of him and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. however now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different. this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of nazi germany war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi crimes against the polish nation invasion of poland collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazism and race untermensch master race white supremacy racial hygiene nuremberg laws aryan race aryanization aryan paragraph honorary aryan white nationalism holocaust victims racialsegregation nazi germany persecution of black people in nazi germany occupation of poland – polish decrees kidnapping of children by nazi germany forced labour under german rule during world war ii extermination through labor antipolish sentiment antislavic sentiment polish question polish joke ahnenpass anschluss lebensraum rassenschande adolf hitler nazism racism scientific racism themes in nazi propaganda germanisation reverse racism relations between nazi germany and the arab world glossary of nazi germanythis guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or nonaryans by the nazis. in fact the only aryanlooking poles that were accepted by nazi germany at the time were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like .% of the whole nation. the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the naziruled nation and were treated only slightly better that the jews. this guy he spreads lies all across wikipedia therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions diannaa. if youd need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed just tell me. i will also try to patrol the articles about poles. ,0
10905,a slight difference with youi have to disagree with your comment above that some of bbbs actions border on censorship. no some of his actions epitomize censorship and although i am generally quite reluctant to call for administrative procedures against anyone and am not at all knowledgeable about such procedures i think we need to get the ball rolling in this case. as my late dad would have said the guys an utter bird. nobody editing on wikipedia should have to deal with this little napoleon nonsense. ,0

10907,current events storyhi i removed the story you posted on cuurent events for several reasons the story didnt seem to belong on the date where you placed it. if the story was reported in a newspaper dated january th it shouldnt be listed under the january th events. i know this may be an important story in belize but as far as i can tell only one newspaper is carrying it and there are no hits on google news. it doesnt appear to be of global importance which is usually what it takes to be included on current events. the summary was way too long. two or three sentences is usually the maximum for a summary. if it wasnt for the first two points i would have attempted to edit the summary instead of deleting. for now im going to remove the story but if you can find more sources please feel free to include a short summary and link on the correct date. jan utc,0

10918,thanks for replying. off hand im not convinced that investigating your reply wizard and how it works would have speeded up this conversation.i checked the deletion log before querying this with you. it merely refers to criteria f invalid fair use claim without any further explanation of exactly why as you have now given.in this instance the stamp image is not used simply as an illustration where as per policy an alternative illustration for example by scanning the covers and creating a similar collage could have been created. it also makes an important contribution to the discussion of the series by demonstrating that it is sufficiently important for a stamp to have been created depicting the series as a whole. the existence of the stamp itself is noteable for a mention in the article.i note that criteria .. is not a wiki policy but merely a guideline and is stated to be one example of acceptable usage not an exhaustive list. the policy above states that usage must follow the spirit of the policy at the top of the page not the guideline list of examples.regards.,0

10928,parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know betterdear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing. she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it. i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section. she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike. not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you.to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in. then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version. is that soapboxing??to use another example closer to home. lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail? like he clearly said here under the desperate? heading heeeeelp. and then he also bizarrely? asks gregalton help him delete references to like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism? can you believe it? i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this. the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll. he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. it made me realize that were going around in circles. we improve the articles to the point that they look great. then they get screwed up again. so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery? it could help people who arent educated...the idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his. the guy is mad. if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation. then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing. zenwhat is clearly a piece of work. check out the dudes talk page. in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana. so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking. what a comboseeing this i ponder my options. i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better? versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions. for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the eight? people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page. it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing. is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines? this is like watching evolution in reverse. i carefully construct a page with the help of others. it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos?. instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0

10999, stop talking nonsense there is no such thing as mongolia region. mongolia has been a country throughout the history inhabitted by mainly mongols along with others but never chinese until recent. the country has been divided in recent history into several pieces due to . manchu invasion . russian expansion and chinese imperialism . spread of communism.not only the term and concept of mongolia region are fabricated this article here along with the inner mongolia article especially the history part are largely communist chinese government. those who i believe they are chinese if not government agent should immediately stop doing this and the wikipedia management should take some actions to stop this chauvinistic plots.,0

11002, basic income dispute resolution i dont understand the finding futile or how to proceed to resolve the issue. regarding the wikipediabicyclesandwagons reference its my understanding that i am building a bicycle that may be slightly off spec and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec. i point out also that the basic income is listed as a priority by four wikigroups and so it is a pretty important bicycle. also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability imo but regardless of this opinion a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed. to keep the bicycles/wagons analogy the page was a high quality bicycle and an important bicycle to wikigroups. there is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away. ,0

11015, the article is mostly about the pound in general with no mass/force distinction due its historical treatment as a weight. perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic pound article and pound mass should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system in this case the pound mass is a member of the fps gravitational system of units. there should be a link to the pound mass article from the pound article of course but it deserves no better treatment than the lb of the fps engineering system. there is a table of the fps systems at poundforce and at slug mass which tabulates various fps systems. its a little less clear than it used to be what was simply called fps engineering is now engineering absolute and the fps gravitational system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the engineering gravitational system which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to newtons nd law. where did the gravitational system come from? maybe some reliable sources are in order.,0

11034,good lord. i mentioned the clusterfucked bureaucracy but i did not anticipate your adherence to it. you deleted my post and it was regarded as vandalism when i tried to repost it. one of the editors which removed my information was on trial for being a bot. im not sure what edit war you are referring to other than my own additions to your page which you state at the top that you welcome. your immediate removal of my edit was very suspicious to me as it seemed pretty authoritative. are you on the edits to marmaduke subscription list? i dont understand. i do not think i am acting like a child. if childish behavior to you is using bad language then call me a a child i suppose. i did not call you any personal names and only referred to what i thought of as a hierarchy on wikipedia as a clusterfucked bureaucracy. i can call your edits an ego trip which they increasingly seem to be as you want to talk to me like i am a child even calling me childish. it seems as if you didnt even consider the several links i included in my last post inculding npr. i am trying to tell you that i made a reasonable edit to a page one that i made before and which lasted several months before i noticed it was gone tonight. you assertion that i am willing to bet no one will show you more sympathy than i will is further proof that this process is an ego trip for you. if users are all equal than i would prefer it if you left me alone. my edit is not inflammatory and included a link to the website. if needs be i can include all of the links i provided on your page if that is enough to validate my claim that marmaduke explained is a relatively popular blog. if all users are equal then why does your designation of my writing as nonnotable brand me with vandalism when i attempt to repost the content? please explain yourself.thanksyournumbertwofan,0

11114,mexico a regional power? i dont agree that mexico is a regional power at least of latin america it could be a regional power of central america but nowadays it is considered to be part of north america.in the other areas of the world the article is divided between east west north south not between ethnic or languagegroups. if this was the case in europe it could be considered latin germanic slave and even anglosaxon groups.if we consider this in the americas case it should be south america and not latin america.second case mexico has a great gdp but in overal terms gdp is not the only factor we should consider military power projection and foreign policy. mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the usa argentina venezuela or colombia have greater military and power projection capabilities historically they have been much more interventionous and agressive toward other nations than mexico and today we can see the same specially in venezuela case. may personally i agree with you but you need sources to say it. this encyclopedia is not a place for orignal research. furthemore editors have produced sources saying mexico is a regional power of latin america if we change it to south america there would be no place in wich to put mexico. besides brazils influence is not restricted to south america it would not make sense to say it is restricted since the sources dont agree.,0

11196,undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. see archive . the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign . hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. the relationship if one can call it that between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright. many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but obamawrighttucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life. if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article. there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also. picking out just hagee to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight. this article is about mccains whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant. if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about mccains campaign which has a couple paragraphs about hagee. in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut. right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on mccainfeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s as compared to more about hagee.,0

11444,dear wikinews wikipedia since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise and/or contribute. for example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia? this is a conflict of interest. another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including “blackpearl “svtcobra” “chris mann” and “whoville” own disney stock have gone to any disney theme park watch disney movies and/or buy disney products? then “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest. does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses? then this is a conflict of interest. what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” don’t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates? as documented volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards. thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.wikipedia and wikinews editors dont follow wikinews own written polices... “do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news. you even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion. you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue. wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it. incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims. are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well? they proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such. wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute. its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating. yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control. if you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more.. does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?,0

11459,=colorb>coldplay expért lets talk this talk page is for discussing the article not world war ii history in general. summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences. my edit stating that as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement. this is not stalins arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the abraham lincoln brigade. prior to the francobritish assisted nazi sudetenland grab relations between nazi germany and soviet union were icy. when the nazis were declaring war on czechoslovakia the ussr was hard at work putting together an antinazi coalition. only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked antislavic aggression did the soviets begin to look for other allies. there is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event. this is not a motive its a statement of facts. if there are no more objections i will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect. respectfully disagree. the statement as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically. one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antihitlers coalition. another school believes that the only stalins aim was the alliance with hitler. the third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory. the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars. we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. we have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources hitlers occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr uk and france and could lead to signing of antihitler triple alliance. in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. had chamberlain and stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had ribbentrop been little bit less active wwii could be this is not a motive its a statement of facts. no. all these facts had already been in the article before your edits. your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote. in addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. try to follow this unwritten rule. that saves a lot of time and efforts. as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events. what nick said also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia ussr would have intervened as well. ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia. ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert. after the seizure of czechoslovakia the ussr held the uk partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the french as allies. if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

11581,you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources. this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions. brian krebs a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog krebs on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up. ... then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer ... and ... iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions ... proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics. it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided. and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company. contributions talk ,0

11586,i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of töbel here it comes dear val who is also a mormon or a parrots aint surei found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. i think that the person concern storm rider is grown up enough to do so on its own. unless next time i am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. it could be interesting. if you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to dont know what to say. so do the wisest just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand. all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light. i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. as for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie what about you? are you val? or are you rama? or are you dgl there is a lot of nick name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name. they are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous. so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo i will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.so what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own? i had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and i dont feel to make it again or take another. following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees hahaha and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule? it is all a lie. how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? it isnt equality it is power struggle. it is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here. wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equalityha ha make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic. for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first. i speak languages english danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek of them fluently the others as pocket use. like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm. as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. in europe from age we choose between languages english german and spanish at age we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew. to languages are part of the compulsory pensum. i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in india. that was for learning,0

11610,it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre but i was trying to correct and add some information about him. i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a prolefebvre position as well. i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre. the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that. both men tried to derail the second vatican council and fought both john xxiii and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way. i dont know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george iii was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant. and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council. why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church? it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity. i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while he didnt exactly what his grandfaters reasons were but he said it probably wasnt hard to guess why.even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article. thats why i added the tag because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction. jun utc,0

11725, utci dont think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written . the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others for a direct and definite compensation wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.for instance in the light of holocaust in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention but was taken to a tragic extreme. likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker if it is a profession has shown to conducted wholly for business gain i.e. higher profit larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain often to the detriment to the business e.g. accountants in the enron scandal. i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition and one that is couched in more modern language. talkcontribs november,0

11730,as posted at regarding a suggested wikipedia regrets the errors regarding the according to format for information cited regarding mediation. this most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why i requested this user be blocked. in addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the nccc article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder. you can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless. ill renew my call for a permanent user and ip range block. loverofart coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature. administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and i assure you that they are out of the norm for the project. i encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation. if you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken. philippe talk ugly personal attacks you approve??good morning philippe. the post above yours by loverofart is typical of his posts in my direction. an ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the national civilian community corps by posting false and misleading information at the wikipedia website.if your / wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that i enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with him/her while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. a responsible adult a real editor should have interceded long ago.he/she and the others working over the nccc text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase according to does not belong at wikipedia. as i read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me. it would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case.i appreciate wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. i am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the wikipedia site. your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.a pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues i raise or the attacks on me.pull loverofart out of this situation and i will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the nccc site. i refuse to have further dealings with him/ ,0

11896,hello barto. i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it? as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left. these are terms both i and ron himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights. i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details.however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article. i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr. gostick. the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him. this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridges document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for.i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself. i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him. i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs. there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense. an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gosticks page in case he didnt know it existed. be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later. one was a recent highlevel member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it. living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone. feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish. do you have a wiki email or a private one? ,0

11908,fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in . by the name fc citizens vardar the club won championships from till . about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together. each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal. how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup. the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents. the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as republics but yet without a nation those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions . in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and vranje prvinces. these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships. in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for the ww the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league. after the ww the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in . the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s macedonian republic league was transformed in to macedonian first league. so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level. its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side. serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues. they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league. they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition. for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information. second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship.,0

11925,improving the twin paradox article hi. any edits i have made to the article have been immidiately reverted. i do not wish to impose my own views on the article. however in its current form it does not in any way reflect the complexity or interest inherent in the problem. as an example of a recent paper which relates to your question so may interest you please see moving observers in an isotropic universe. the paper itself can be downloaded pdf version. this paper differs from my own view but illustrates the inherent and enduring interest of the problem. my major objection to the wikipedia article in its current form is it solves the paradox by mistating it. i.e. by stating a nonparadox in place of the interesting ones. how can i go about getting the article expanded to reflect the varying points of view? i dont want to get involved in a reverting war. any advice you can give me would be much appreciated,0

11966,all of those statements need to be referenced. leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information. to point out one thing ill bring up consolidated appropriations act . first it has a number of tags on it the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag. second the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that. it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link. its possible that some came from this as well i cant tell. ill also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic so the article is riddled with grammatical errors mostly incomplete sentences. on creation the opening read consolidated appropriations act h.r. is a bill passed to the th united states congress ive never heard this usage to rather than by and assume it is incorrect another editor changed it the lead is also missing an important determiner. in any case you can take a look at  vesey ,0

11988,=wolfram===a hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it. such bodies do not reflect light and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be selfluminous. all blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium. however the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength known as the planck law cannot be predicted using classical physics. this fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics. wolfram referenced to eisberg r. and resnick r. thermal radiation. § in quantum physics of atoms molecules solids nuclei and particles nd ed. new york wiley pp. .i think this also supports the must emit part of the definition. ==,0

11999,nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time. the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it. he/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed his/her mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on was on him/her not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago ... decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that. does or add clutter? sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt he/she even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about / of the entire article dealt with norman schwarzkopf an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaith/goodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles. he/she was involved in blocking input to the article. why? was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying. i dont really have time for this. i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles. i could pretend this user didnt do what he/she did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense. i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative. as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles. the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. also i dont recal ever having called him/her a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently. his/her behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems. i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper he/she isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english. i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon. nothing new under the sun here. if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all. i know whats going on. i dont know why but i dont have to and i expect the motivations arent interesting. respond if you have anything to say. ,0
