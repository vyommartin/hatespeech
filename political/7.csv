12005~thanks your copyedits are much appreciated as is the advice. to reply to your pointsi was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit although i want to make sure to keep enough of it in. especially in szigeti on the violin he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing which in my opinionis very important for his biography. that said i will try trimming it down.yes he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years and as far as i can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. there are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography maybe ill try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere. i had a good laugh at your remark about how i should get academic credit for this especially because just a few days ago my obnoxious music history professor bellowed dont ever look up anything on wikipedia if you expect to stay in this class wikipedia sucks rocks after which everyone burst out laughing and i sat fuming. anyway thanks again you are very helpful and much appreciated as usual ~0

12011~sorry to take so long in replying ive only had a small amount of wp time the last few days. i see the point you are making on the other hand it seems useful to say something about general haftars character given such a reputable source says something about it after consulting odd people which given fts reputation you would think is a balanced representation of his contacts but they do not say who they were. i agree the ft quote wasn’t well informed in politics is very surprising given his position. im happy with you removing this and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info. ft registration is nocost for a few articles a month but here is a wider quote of what they saideven supporters acknowledge his political ambitions suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country’s liberals. the armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the gaddafiera military he repeatedly turned against the islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the uprising. many wonder whether he is a committed democrat as he claims or just another arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions in the mould of egypt’s gamal abdel nasser syria’s hafez assad and need someone tough like haftar to step up to the outlaws” says the commentator abdel hamid eljadi. “he has experience in the libyan military and he knows the tribes. if he has political ambitions we’ll deal with that in the second stage.”but others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. of nearly two dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the financial times none could identify any of his interests outside war. in meetings with exiled opposition groups in the us and africa before he returned to serve as the rebel army’s chief of staff in the uprising he spoke only of his military expertise. “he wasn’t well informed in politics relationships between countries or cultures” said one gaddafiera opposition libyans and international experts fear the offensive that mr haftar is coordinating could further destabilise the country. in televised appearances he has a habit of conflating the islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the libyan muslim brotherhood and with alqaeda. ~0

12013~ obrien argentina hi. i have rescued your article which was in danger of being deleted as a hoax. the first bit was fine and could be backed up by sources which i have added but it was a mistake to put in the facetious bits about pork scratchings and his frustratingly sober mind because a that jokey tone isnt right for a serious encyclopedia and b you made them up in wp terms thats original research and not verifiable. it was those that made it look like a hoax. dont be discouraged have a look at the guide to writing wpyfayour first article. regards ~0

12020~= sample of bona fide sources demonstrating or referring to official us recognition of scientology as a religion ===here is how the new york times commented on the tax exemption the landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes. more significantly the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in scientologys worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. on the basis of the i.r.s. ruling the state department formally criticized germany for discriminating against scientologists. the german government regards the organization as a business not a taxexempt religion the very position maintained for years by the american government. i think the ny times writer clearly expresses the view here that the us abandoned their earlier view of scientology as a business as still espoused today by germany. note that the state department report referred to in the ny times article is the religious freedom report. the religious freedom reports for germany have discussed discrimination against scientologists by the german state almost every year since the irs decision referring in for example to certain religious minorities notably scientologists. following the irs decision the irs wrote to foreign governments appending a document entitled description of the scientology religion to their letter and stating that various scientology organizations had demonstrated that they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual. media references to the scientology religion and similar references to scientology as a religion are common. the encyclopedia of american civil liberties says that despite its legal setbacks scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the united states. as for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the united states to determine what is or is not a religion the united states court of appeals ninth circuit stated in a decision that indeed the irs itself has stipulated in other cases that the church of scientology is a bona fide religion. so in the view of that court at least the irs has been quite capable of making such stipulations. the st. petersburg times wrote in that after a year battle the irs dropped its tax dispute with scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in . such sources cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand as scientologist misrepresentation. ==~0

12023~it doesnt matter how many of them end in uis maybe its not even lithuanian i dont know ask phils dad. but rudzevecuis is a name it gets hits and there are loads of people out there with that name. yeah rudzevicius is also a name and its about % more common than rudzevecuis. but phil rudzevicius and phillip rudzevicius get zero hits thats the point. phil rudzevecius gets hit and phillip rudzevecius gets zero. phil rudzevecuis and phillip rudzevecuis get and respectively with loads of decent sources for rudd. i imagine rudzevecuis and rudzevicius are variations on the same name like davis and davies for example. hes even credited as phil rudzevecuis in the cd booklet for buster browns something to say. if you can find a good source for phil rudzevicius we can put it in but until then we cant. ~0
12024~any news? hello there any news from the board of directors? oops sorry about that i meant the experts you refered to on handling the subject of copyright rules and regulations tomorrow is the day when my images will be deleted from wikipedia so what will happen next? im sure that i would at least be able to use my own paintings with my written article since there is no reason for me to prohibit myself from using these pictures.but if we get no instructions whatsoever of how to go about things i see no other option than to abort any inclusion of images with the article and just make it a plain written one based on the notes which i have delivered so far. or what is your outlook on this?~0

12041~so you step down from your statement the story is quite different when the old men become informants and underage kids child soldiers? im rather interested what part of your statement did i misinterpreted? as for german collaborators i do have evidence that ak soldiers killed lithuanians who were volunteers in lithuanian wars of independence and had nothing to do with nazi government. yes thay did kill family of one policemen and one policemen but killing family with little children is not the same as kill collaborator dont you think? but well i might be overreacting as ive read the lithuanian commission material and it is quite difficult to remain calm after reading how for example ak did shoot a teacher in the school holding her two years child in her hands or stabbed a child lying in a cradle with a bayonet and held him in the air until he stopped moving and many more facts of punishing collaborators. btw i do have full statement of this commission and it clearly states that ak did commit manslaughter and crimes against humanity. its official document not some newspaper interpretation.another thing please would you explain how so you forgot to mention in the edit summary that you are removing perfectly valid references to professional historians both of whom are specialists on the subject here and evaded requested citation from polish newspaper how so is polish newspaper good ad lithuanian is not? ~0

12043~the best way to attract more editors is simply to make a proposal with an rfc. when you proposed the template it was as a badge of shame. tfd below is still using it as a badge of shame. and the reason the article is locked is not because of differences in povs it is because folks edit war to remove reliable sources. smalltalk ~0

12046~some of the things i wanted to conribute articles i was working on contributing before getting pulled into the theological debates on wiki.george l kline the alfred north whitehead scholar he is mentioned in the metaphysical society of america here on wiki and i would like to link an article from there to start a bio on him. here are some links about him and how he has contributed to the eurasia debate. kline is a scholar on the subject of russian philosophy and religion and since my conflict here has been on where eastern orthodoxy conflicts with roman catholicism there is no such content in these works of any great amount and i can avoid all that while adding this important and rare information here at wiki as it should all be common knowledge but has no free source to become common knowledge before now. this information is in light of eurasianism. which considering what is happening in crimea right now is a subject i will need to avoid. list of russian philosophers whose names i have added to wikipedia but was unable to go back and create articles on them. pamfil danilovich yurkevichvictor dimitriyevich kudryyavtsevplatonov archybishop nikanor dmitri vassilyevich boldyrev sergey alexandrovich levitskyvladimir alexandrovich kozhevnikovarticle subjects very difficult and very hard compress without creating possible misconceptionsmystical realismintuitvist personalismintuitvist realism russian~0

12072~ utcthis debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. the consensus definition of fact is something that can be demonstrated to be true in other words something based on empirical evidence. i think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition fact that is they would not claim that their views are built on empirical evidence. frankly the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. thus statements about which there is no factbased debate such as the roundness of the earth can be stated as fact. nonfactbased dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the factseeking encyclopedia user.the alternative as far as i can figure is to not state anything at all as fact which would make wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. as one who believes that wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia this isnt a very attractive prospect. if anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact go right on ahead. january ~0

12075~ crocus olivieri istanbulensis dear rivertorchthis taxon is one on the three subspecies of crocus olivieri.its correct name is crocus olivieri gray subsp. istanbulensis b. mathew. i have corrected it. i hope the anonymous user will not change it again.best regards to reply hi réginald. if you hadnt arrived on the scene i was going to ping you. i removed the turkish image and link since i didnt think they were germane but i left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. does mathews classification as it appears in the article contain all the known species of crocus? hi riverthe page contains all the recorded species but not the infraspecific taxa i.e. the numerous subspecies. originally crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. for consistency reason including it required to mention also as i did the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.the issue is if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies with their distribution as for that of c. olivieri? among others the numerous subspecies of the variable c. biflorus. a niggling work i am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.your advice about this issue?best regards to reply ps you can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the ncbi taxonomy browser. type crocus in the search for bar. to reply thanks for the link—thats a great resource. i dont think we should worry about its being too scholastic. my main concern would be with consistency im not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. the information about subspecies certainly should be available on wikipedia but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species of which there are now only a few. i dont know. for consistency reasons i have added the other subspecies reported in the ncbi taxonomy and cited the source. i agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done as e.g. i have done in frcrocus. to reply okay. id be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations if you want to go that route. just remember i dont know what im talking about dear riveri have removed again the the logo of the sultanbeyli district municipality that userterzinator had added again to crocus explaining the reason for doing it see user talkterzinator. hopefully he/she will not add it againbest regards to reply thanks réginald. i dont do edit wars so im glad theres someone else diligently watching the page. i see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fairuse claims. i try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies but if it gets added again i will see if it can be deleted on those grounds. good comment i like this comment at wpblprfc — toronto gosh that was quick. thanks the timing was purely coincidental. as for me i’m waiting before reviewing and voting. the thing seems to be growing exponentially though. plus it’s spread across so man~0

12104~ call current discussion that is our discussion of the big changes you started here just about days ago. it will be hard to anyone coming to the discussion at this point to know much of what were talking about with this much removed. i know but then not much was being removed. but ive put back october. cultural depictions of johannes gutenberg ive started an approach that may apply to wikipedias core biography articles creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information. i started that last year while i raised joan of arc to featured article when i created cultural depictions of joan of arc which has become a featured list. recently i also created cultural depictions of alexander the great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article. since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion id like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here. regards cleanup and changes by mukerjee oct a number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up onoct the claims of printing in korea and china largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations the biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up but still needs work. the contributions of gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters this was presented with documentation the possibility that eastwest traffic over the two preceding centuries of the mongol empire may have led to some knowledge in europe of movable type was introduced a number of sentences and structures such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs were copyedited ruthlessly merged with other fragments and cleaned up. user dicklyon reverts with the comment too much of a change to do without discussion. this is not a criteria in wikipedia where ruthless editing is consistentlyencouraged. please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them byputting in extensive work instead of just a revert. i am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better and has far better referencing and citations than the present version. please giveyour reasons here please do not blindly revert edit the text to merge the elements you dont agree with. it does not make sense to keepthe older inferior version that people are working with still. such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months with no chance for incremental review and collaboration is just too disruptive and disrespectful in my opinion. but ill let someone else decide now whether to revert you again. i recommend a revert followed by you reintegrating changes piece by piece with time between for reactions and negotiations. p.s. we dont need weasle words in the lead. if it is verfiably true that even within europe there are those who claim that laurens janszoon coster of holland may have used movable types earlier then you have to say who makes such a claim and give a verifiable reference for it. the things i have read about coster did not say that anyone actually claims or believes that only that it was a local legend for a while. i understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone. but the socalled stable version read rather poorly and at least the english and the flow is a lot cleaner. there were repeated references e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in biog the a award had two references etc there were poor constructsand of course the referencing was admittedly poor. so please try to look at the whole picture. wikipedia says it right up front edit the page only if you dont mind others ruthlessly editing your text. as for the weasel word issue this is what the current version reads pls see the biography section these were edits that were made before your comment herehis business partner was johann fust who was more of a banker than a printer but a history by hadrianus junius of holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to gutenberg from laurens janszoon coster via fust who was apprenticed to coster around and may have brought some of his equipment to mainz~0

12106~speedy deletion of image a tag has been placed on image requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section i of the criteria for speedy deletion because it is available as a bitforbit identical copy on the wikimedia commons under the same name or all references to the image on wikipedia have been updated to point to the title used at commons. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. lastly please note that if the article does get deleted you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you. ~0

12115~i agree. the entire section titled bridging the second and third reichs in german south west africa looks like wpor. although im sure some authors have touched on the subject our article gives it undue space. in addition lots of items in the table look like pure speculation. descriptions such as heinrich worked in german southwest africa and hermann was a well known member of the nsdap this guy originated the slogan lebensraum while in gswa in a sympathizer who influenced the nsdap since or even member nsdap in founder of german east africa this article is not about german east africa. enumerating every single person who visited gswa and later had some role in wwii does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided. remember this article is about german southwest africa i.e. narrower in scope than german colonialism and wider than the herero and namaqua genocide. talk ~0
12116~user... you keep wanting to insert that it is amazing that backwell won the magarey medal after having his finger amputated. i am not sure why it is amazing that he should play well after having his finger amputated. he has stated at the club that it was far harder playing in with the constant pain and also his wrist bearing the brunt of efforts to mark the ball without contacting his finger. his major medical issues in were in fact a back injury and nothing to do with his finger or lack thereof. before we get into an edit war you might want to enlighten why it is amazing. a source or citation would be handy no pun intended. ~0

12120~ outrageous bias what happened to wikipedia priding itself on objectivity and neutrality? the article on the cole girl is a farce. her own p.r team couldnt have done a better job. every section follows the same pattern mrs cole is a precious wee cherub and the world should be grateful it has her. every source cited is biased in coles favour from fashion articles to reviews of her music. objectivity seems to have gone out of the window. how do i officially question this articles neutrality? to whom should i complain? ~0

12124~if there are fatah estimates im sorry palestinian national authority estimates then lets have them linked on the talk page first. then we would have to ask according to reliable sources how credible are these estimates? because ive checked for media coverage of gaza casualty counts and havent found anything that even mentions them. maybe isnt good enough we need to have solid sources backing each piece of text we put in this article. mind you i have a sneaking suspicion that fatah does have some relationship with the italian guy who claims its all a hamaspchrwhoun conspiracy to boost casualty figures but thats my own idle speculation and is irrelevant. ~0

12148~there is a profound confusion in what jim is saying. maybe because he has left the movement many many years ago? i have studied this subject indepth and spoke with current students one of which was initiated in the knowledge just last year. this is what my research shows methe tecniques are very simple and there is ample evidence that these are quite ancient and referred to in many practices books and poemsthere is no magic or grace or opening the third eye involved. for the last years the knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher maharaji.four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown these are made verbally and no legal document signed students are trusted implicitly. give a fair chance to knowledge dont reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings. the whole presentation last / hours.as there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy students are free to use these techniques one hour per day is recommended. there is no cohersion to do anything beyond the very mild promise give a fair chance to the practice.and no jim my sources do not include exstudents. this is an article on prem rawat/maharaji not his critics. we have added a critics section because there are critics like you and it is needed for a good encyclopedic npov article. but make no mistake this article is about prem rawat/maharaji and his movement and not about the small group of critics that you represent. aug utc~0

12155~raymond arrittthis is not an accident some of the sections/articles on kambojas as being edited and altered by debachmann are getting utterly confusing and more messier and im afraid may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers. as he has started editing/altering them en mass either he should improve the articles by editing them suitably so as to keep them clear logical and readable and at the same time also maintain/keep intact their integrity and factuality lets us if he can do it or else i will have no alternative except to revert them back to their original versions. for example the article language and ethnicity of kambojas in its current form which he has edited is utterly terrible. i dont think he and other editors on kamboj articles of his kind are quite familiar with the kamboj history so as to render them a justice. further please make a note that none of the information in any of articles on the kambojas is a originalresearch as mr debachmann continues to allege. all the kamboj information is in the books and only he and other people of his ilk may not be aware of it. i have sent this note to him not with any intention to enter into a futile argument with him but simply to let him know that all the information on the kambojas..ancient/mediaval or modern as inserted in any kamboj related article here is welldocumented and has been taken from reliable references/sources from notable scholars.cheers and have a nice day.~0

12186~and the lead spokesperson in the current battle with the bittorrent technology invented by bram cohen. these claims by torrentspy are false. torrentspy is trying to obscure the facts to hide the fact that they are facilitating thievery. we are confident that our lawsuit against them will be successful because the law is on our side.is that at all relevant? the section is about leadership and then it suddenly starts on about bittorrent.shouldnt be there but i am not sure enough to delete it myself.opinions? ~0

12193~please excuse the intrusion but ive noticed over the years that petrarchan has come up with an enormous number of good ideas that never get acted upon. im wondering if a specific village pump page would be better for her proposals or if the gender gap project could help her structure her proposals so that they are more amenable to acceptance. i think its a real shame that her ideas are just being ignored. i suspect the wmf could also benefit from her insight in many different ways.~0

12195~so overdue the copyright cleanup barnstar thank you for always being conscious of and responsible with copyright issues. talk i cant believe that i havent spammed you with one of these before. i dont remember at what point you transitioned into being one of the people on wikipedia that i just think of as awesome in this area but its been such a long time ago that i would have assumed i had already popped in a picture to express my appreciation. i consider this long overdue. thank you so much for keeping an eye out for this and facilitating the cleanup of so many issues. you help keep our articles quality. talk ~0
12196~deletion of rafiq husseinihi im contacting you because as you were the admin that deleted dr. rafiq husseini at february on grounds of a no indication that the article may meet guidelines for inclusion most politicians dont have a shred of notability while i agree with your general assessment of politicians i disagree it in this instance. he is notable inter alia as the deputy secretary general water and environment division representing palestine of the union for the mediterranean. this is one or uniquely of the few international bodies where representatives of the states of israel and palestine work together in equal roles.i had considered writing an article on him because the distinguished israeli secretary general already has one. reinventing wheels is a tedious and thankless task. i wonder if you could do a tempundelete so that i can access any citations or other pertinent text to sandbox it and bring it up to scratch. the mediterranean union a sarkozy who i disliked construct would have been a better mechanism for the eu in the context of the ukraine and saved the ensuing mess that is still occurring there. thanks~0
12197~... first of all blogs are not considered reliable references and the author doesnt even do aikido i think the aikido journal reference is far better. i never liked the term blending that is more style specific than general aikido so it was good that you started the change but it is better to match the better reference.~0
12198~what you say about verifiable sources to be used for encyclopedias makes sense. im not a wikipedia author and i guess it would have been a good idea to read the wikipedia guidelines thoroughly sorry anyway while ill stick to my personal opinion on the yfg issue im not going to change this line in the article anymore.~0

12202~like many of the socalled sources that infect rebublican articles the views of jack holland and the irish echo hardly count as authoritative and independent. its just as likely he fell over whilst planting an ied or shot himself. i think we need to get real here these pages dont belong to republicans wikipedia just doesnt work that way. at least it shouldnt but your campaigns show it can be manipulated in that fashion by a determined group and at the moment you are winning as the admins vacillate too much and are too weak to resist you all. well done ~0

12207~==sleaze usage==first off i must say that calling anything sleaze in an article is pov but it is quite embarrassing when its not even the right spelling. so supposing that it were to be corrected in spelling it would still be completely out of place.this is from the sound sectionon their debut record they successfully treaded heavy metal territory while managing to stay hard rock while on time bomb the band took their sleaze to an extreme with an excess of profanity and attitude.with buckcherry has continued their decadent glam metal inspired sleaze ignoring popular trends in music.~0
12208~but it is most important that the editors report what a source actually says and not twist it to their pov by quoting or paraphrasing it out of context. the editors note provides the context for the reader it does not try to tell the reader what to think. twisted what the authors meant to serve its agenda by keeping the context from the readers. and when wp uses it promulgates the lies.the purpose of an encyclopedia is to report what people or groups say and believe without commentary on whether it is good bad or indifferent. all of the articles in wp about and related to creationism are editorialized up the wazoo. in other words on this topic wp has ceased to be an encyclopedia and has become a propaganda machine. ~0

12211~it may be sourced but ... sources have to reflect the weight and relevance of a particular fact. verne is primarily remembered as a science fiction writer. how much of the sources actually mention pederasty? there appears to be no concrete proof of this so is it right to possibly slander a dead person given that if the same allegations were made today they would be libellous and baseless allegations or something similar? shouldnt the section be cut down at least?~0

12232~ further on amdo hi i appreciate your additions to the history section in amdo. however regarding the latest addition according to tibetan government in exile chogyal phagpa the head of the sakyapa school of tibetan buddhism became the religious instructor of kublai khan. in exchange chogyal phagpa received the support of kublai khan and assumed political power over the three provinces or cholkas of tibet. the three dharma kings of tibet this intereaction called priestpatron in tibetan chöyön relation was the first in history of tibet and was also developped under afterward circonstancestibetan sovereignty debate. i wanted to query two things.first the amdo article is about the amdo region not tibet and not the sovereignty debate. while i can see how the relations with the mongols can be relevant since the mongols first incorporated amdo into other commandaries/provinces i dont think we need too much detail on the relations between the mongols and tibet that is dealt with in other articles. furthermore it is bad form to use internal reference i.e. another wikipedia article cannot be used as a reference. finally this statement presents only one point of view when clearly there are several. i dont want the history section of amdo to turn into a rehash of either history of tibet or tibet sovereignty debate.i propose to cut the added paragraph to a relationship which the tibetan governmentinexile now terms a patronpriest relationship whereby tibet exchanged political control for the power of religious instruction of the khans.ref. please let me know if there are any problems with this proposal. talk ~0

12236~its ok. i note however that your edit was the article ... appeared not article has been mentioned as you write above. details precision and accuracy count. the wording you actually used would be incorrect and the wording you think you used would be better but im going to leave my page the way it is for the time being. ~0
12237~pov tag addedthroughout this article there is an overreliance on the organisations own claims together with a lack of neutral sources. claims are stated as if they are automatically true rather than just being statements made by the organization. the lead is especially flawed in this aspect. the whole ordering of the article with its subsection headings is also suspect it reads like an advertorial. important information is missing. there is a complete absence of any detail about who finances the organization a crucial absence given that this might reveal more of the organisations aims. for the same reason financing info should be near the top of the article not at its very bottom.~0

12249~birther information should probably be included since its what he is currently in the news for. most major news sources are reporting that he has just concluded a sixmonth investigation finding probable cause that both the longform birth certificate and a secondary record of president obamas are forgeries. he claims his investigation is apolitical even though it was initiated and funded by the local tea party and he is currently under investigation by the feds with a history of repeated violation of federal orders.i also find it odd there is no mention of the allegations of mishandling of sex crimes here or in the added article which seems like it should be merged here anyway since its virtually all arpaio material even though references for them exist in the latter and this is wellestablished. is someone scrubbing content? ~0
12250~that is not the case. there was much duplicate information because i move the listoriented information out of the lead and down into the body of the text. the lead is supposed to be a summary of the rest of the article not a laundry list.~0
12251~disgustedno word can better describe how i feel about wikipedia right now than disgusted. i have deactivated all of my tools and bot tasks indefinitely until such time that i decide how id like to proceed.  yak  scotty you are a great asset to wikipedia and it would be a very large negative if you left i agree fully   concur. as do i. i appreciate that we havent always got on mostly in rather than unofficial capacity but as my comment on drmies talkpage makes clear i consider you one hell of an editor. i dont want to see you mocked or belittled for the sterling work you do and i certainly dont want to see you leave. scotty i dont want to see you leave either but what you said about my entire existence belittles my contributions in an unacceptable manner. i got fucking blocked for responding to your sneer so eating some crow on your part is no more than fair it seems to me. drmies come on. you guys just got blocked and unblocked for going at each other. is it really necessary to keep poking? you both think you were justified you both think the other wasnt lets just let this die before it flares up again for round two. fluffernutter i dont think this needs mediation thanks. scotty is a big boy and so am i. we disagree over something and we could have handled that very well i suppose until someone came in between and started throwing blocks about. scotty im sorry for what i said you hurt my feelings and i let it be known. im not going to come back here since i dont want to bother you you can always drop me a line on my talk page and youre welcome to leave a tb template as well pace dntr. take it easy taking occasional breaks is healthy and encouraged. just dont be a fucking diva about it please. editors have placed trust in you to be a reliable bot operator and tool maker. suggestion replace that second sentence with but remember for intended effect and best results. believe me scotty i know how you feel. i fell into the same trap this time last year for a much less and never recovered and i know you are familiar with that whole kerfuffle. i have gotten to the point now where i rarely edit article here anymore. the only difference is that i wasnt an admin. i hope you dont completely give up on this place like i did im also glad someone had the good sense to undo the block. some stroopwafels for you i guess you need them. all this drama makes more harm than good. — i just wanted to add something... dont leave us — your tools i dont know whats going on here or who is right or wrong but deactivating your tools? is that really necessary? do you really hate us that much? i find the editor interaction analyser a vital tool for checking for socks for instance. i hope you will consider either reactivating at least some of these or a way to pass them over to someone else. newlin~0

12270~ rs? moved from user talklexein. doesnt belong on my talk page. in the context of the claes oldenburg coosje van bruggen articles who or what is rs? as an editor you already know that rs is wikipediaeditor shorthand for independent reliable source as in wprs. every statement made in a wikipedia article unless it is an obvious one like the sky is blue should be wpv verifiable policy meaning supported by independent wpreliable sources strong guideline. the more extraordinary the claim the more reliable should be the sources. see also wpvrs for a capsule summary. in other words wikipedia is not the authority which is speaking the sources are. we paraphrase quote and cite them. what you wrote has not been explicitly discussed in the media yet.nd point we dont write about wikipedia or internal matters unless independent reliable sources have done so to do so again sets up wp or an editor as an authority. rd point see wpburden which spells out that it is the duty of the adding editor to cite reliable sources supporting the claim. if none exist the claim must not be added to a wikipedia article. ~0

12274~wikipedia may not be a soapbox in theory. when fascists and racists use it as one in fact then the maximum force should be used to kick them out with no hackles as to their right to share their venom unimpeded. not to just uphold npov. nor for any other policy. but because fascism and racism violently opposes the very right of whole segments of people to simply exist much less allow them freedom of conscience and inquiry it is imperative to be quite clear which side of the issue wikipedia is on. ~0
12275~you cant call sources hardly academic if they contradict iranica as iranica is not the only but one of the academic sources and it has also some biases as every academic source has. and coming to the claim that baku was mentioned before tukic tribes arrived in caucausus it is simple untrue because i can provide at least three russian sources which mention turkic tribes in baku area in the same time of possibly centuries of bakus foundation. according to artomonov istoriya khazar published in leningrad in in page turkic tribes first appear in caucasus in ad. another scholar yeremeyev in his book etnogenez turok published in in moscow writes beginning from iiiiv centuries turkic tribes became permanent neighbours of people of asia minor and caucasus and balkans and were influxing into this areas actively and pletneva in her book xazari published in moscow in writes that in turkic tribes of suvars were defeated by another turkic tribe avars after this suvars settled/moved to caucasianalbania.~0

12281~esteban cambiasso again dear kylietasticthank you for your reply to my query about why you accused me of making edits on a page that i had never even visited. yes you are right i do access wikipedia from the o uk mobile network. but wikipedia has now blocked everyone using this network from making edits. this is crazy. i have never done anything wrong or vandaliam on your site. i am a writer and some time ago someone put completely incorrect information on one of your pages because they had completely misread one of my books. at that time i was able to edit and so was able to change the awful remarks of the idiot who had written them. but now i am blocked through no fault of my own and therefore if someone else does the same thing i am now unable to answer. this is terrible. what is wikipedia doing? these blanket blocks are ridiculous and completely totally unfair.~0
12282~poor articlesit wasnt a mere violation of professional conduct rules. it was criminal. if you are breaking the speed limit and an officer gives you a warning instead of a ticket does that mean it was not illegal? no. try speeding again with him watching. shapiro was judged by our legal process and legally punished and if he tried to do it again could go to jail. criminal despictable lies legally punished in two states that destroyed victims chances of a fair settlement and resulted in an internationally condemned fraud to lose his livelihood that consisted of cheating innocents. balance some milktoast version with that. my version is neutral. this sounds like a vendetta. in fact this attorney was not disbarred but suspended. and it was not criminal. before you start creating articles to blast someone anyone i dont care how reprehensible you think he is you should consider what the ramifications might be. i dont care about this article anymore but it is abundantly clear that some not only care but are willing to write articles for the sole purpose of bashing not for any real content or information purposes. that was clear when this article was recreated even before the deletion review was completed. i regret ever have been involved with this but it sure did open my eyes about wikipedia. ~0
12283~my suggestion is that either you find a peerreviewed journal article to back the methods of falsifiability that you have listed or you delete the section about falsifiability. i have been following the wiki guidance of dicussiong these changes prior to making changes to the article but if you cannot give clear justification and you only delete the discussion then it is within my rights to make changes to the article without a discussion. in other words i would suggest playing fair. you dont have to follow my suggestion but then i dont have to play fair either.~0
12284~look its okay. in the ga process the reviewer is king. ive done about ga reviews myself and while most went smoothly a couple of times the nominator ended up furious with me. going to ga was your idea in the first place so id say stick with it work out a series of cuts with the reviewer that you both can tolerate and get the green star or whatever that thingamajig is.~0
12285~its interesting that this ip feels they know me so well when i have had limited interaction with you. we have never actively engaged each other on talk pages. its amazing you somehow have been able to edit every page i edit every photograph you crop is mine. have you wondered where this ire against me and my work has come from? you continually put a photo of a man in a wig a photoshopped wig at that on the afro page and four different editors have removed it five if you include me. this is what you consider ownership and edit warring? then you have taken my photographs and decided to rename them simply to remove david shankbone out of the file name. your intentions are no pure. you are gaming the policies and guidelines to wikistalk me. you say not to bite the newcomers but i havent actively engaged you. if you are a newcomer how come you have such a handy knowledge of wiki policies and guidelines? why is every page in your history one i have contributed to? what is your issue with me in particular? you have also done all of this under another ip~0

12289~your kind two notes of thanks. i share some interests with you. especially a dislike for pr editors although my pet peeve is the medical pr types who are pushing a point of view that is protective of the medical industry which is not always honest or accurate. that is a far tougher fight than ronan farrow.i also noticed a couple of things on your talk page.i dated kieth brions daughter for many years and marched with him in the yale band at the yaleharvard game one year. noone has done more for military music then he and his love was john philips souza. dont have much rs for you as that was his passion not mine.i also know quite a bit about north korea. i would probably have thought the bias article you created was a candidate for deletion but i am not that interested in doing that kind of advocacy. i am interested in why you believe that north korea is significantly more functional than the media impression. having studied both in some detail i think much of the basic premise of their reputation is well founded but i do appreciate different opinions.~0

12293~ suggestion for expanding article hello i was just checking out the main page and noticed there is no hobos now or hobos in north america today section. fact of the matter is there is a huge explosion in tent cities and homeless in usa and obviously the same dynamic as in the s great depression e.g. massive economic downturn super hi layoffs equals more and more hobos and homeless. man san francisco is full of homeless vagrants as is portland oregon. fact of the matter is there is a huge homeless encampment by the pdx portland airport. there are loads of folks living out of their cars nowadays or in friends cars. the term hobo applies to these folks today facing such hard times going city to city by train hitchhike etc.~0

12301~ill have a think about this. some of it amounts to hmm not a basic civility but an outright encouragement. id like to take that up. sometimes however a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors. i think a comments with a lapse is better for the first type. im still sticking with decline for the second type.a third case is c errors concealing c errors. often real c checking cant begin without appropriate citations. perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.jargon is harder. citations are a jargon driven field. this is mostly where ill be thinking about it.in terms of actual linebyline referencing the problem is that when i want to say burdetthateful for burdett example. my hateful dreams about ducks. in a compendium of duck hatred. ed. janice fowlloather london avianloathe press . often the nominator turns up with janice fowlloather . a compendium of duck hatred. avian. or some other partial attempt made worse through use of the citation templates without understanding the basic concept behind citation for verification. if i quote it as fn it breaks rapidly if i quote it as fowlloathercompendium it should actually change.in paying off verbosity against wordlimits i suppose i need to shift back towards verbosity but this is an encyclopedia article youre quoting that makes it a tertiary source the only really reliable tertiary sources are ones aimed at an academic public written by academics. the way we determine this is usually are do the articles contain a specific byline by an academic specialist in the field acting as an author of that specific article you quote. are the articles signed. your citation doesnt indicate this is an academic work by academics signed by academics it is an unsigned tertiary source. please provide a full citation so we can judge it. let me keep thinking. ~0

12306~“claim kshatriya status but generally recognised as shudra” this is a claim of consensus claim. i see no source which is defining a consensus. what these sources are saying is their own view only. a source defining a consensus would be saying something like “most people think kurmis are s”. there is no such source. besides that the sentence in the article is immensely confusing. it does not spell out who regards kurmis as s. that should be clear. who? indians? certinly not. martians? are you serious? americans? most of them won’t happen to know what is “kurmi”. who else? academics? where do we have a source saying that? showing ten sources that talk about kurmis as s and concluding on our own that they are generally regarded as x won’t do. that is synthesis/or. then we have to guard against cherry picking too as nameisnotimportant has been indicatingcherry picking is one of the major pitfalls of using gbooks. even if we do find a non cherry picked clear statement we will have to see if the statement is encyclopedic enough. that would mean we need to find the same statement in another encyclopedia to say the same thing in the same way i.e. near the top of the article. i don’t really think this can be done by these sources or any other sources. imo the statement is best scrapped and replaced by something like “recognitionrecognized by goi as obc”. it makes no sense to say “claim kshatriya status but generally recognised as shudra” because they are not s. asat. i am glad that we now have some fresh users on the talk page and agree that their presence and their suggestions have helped let the discussion take a positive and meaningful turn. we have quotes on the page now some degree of willingness to discuss things in a meaningful manner. as i have been saying if we want to keep the present sentence we have to come up with a clear non cherry picked encyclopedic quote defining a consensus. we don’t have it imo. there may be other considerations too and i may bring them up if necessary. i would suggest that the sentence be changed.~0

12321~ well in that case the wiki rules should be enforced. in particular putting art greenfields words of treason and death penalty into the main sarfatti article is a violation of wiki rules because it is false. also greenfield was quoting directly from federal law and what was put into the sarfatti article was completely distorted out of context. in any case it is obvious that several of the wiki admins have violated the basic wiki rule of objective fairness and they all should recuse themselves and leave it up to ed poor jimbo wales and the wiki board as a matter of integrity and fairness. sarfatti is a volatile hot head when he is put under the stress of personal attacks on his character. his angry words should not be engraved in stone. let he who is without guilt cast the first stone. userufo black opsufo black ops~0
12322~regular disclaimer on vandal userrovoam dear fellow wikipediansthis ip is just one of a whole army of anon ips used by a wellknown vandal userrovoam who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of wikipedia as the most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in wikipedia so far.this person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous azerbaijan and turkeyrelated entries such as nagornokarabakh caucasian albania artsakh arran azerbaijan urartu azerbaijan azerbaijan disambiguation turkey kuraaraxes culture nakhichevan safavids karabakh khojaly khojaly massacre stepanakert khankendi ganja city baku demographics of azerbaijan history of azerbaijan azerbaijani language azeri caucasus history of turkey oghuz turks ottoman empire turks turkic languages turkic peoples mannaeans and even templateeurope removing azerbaijan and turkey from the list.he also vandalized user pages and talkpages including usertabib usertony sidaways user page and talkpages user talkrdsmith user talkcryptoderk talkpages userweyes userdante alighieri userchanting fox.since the person uses wide range of ips it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. in the past hes been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new ip. thats why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages some of them more than once.rovoam started his actions in wikipedia from introducing nationalistic pov edits in nagornokarabakh yet back in february . his aggressive discussion behaviour unilateral unagreed changes to the entry and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors with myself being his major opponent. the conflict was formally decided after arbitration committee placed him under oneyear revert limitation and personal attack parole . however this decision made rovoam even more radical and obsessive as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt wikipedia perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me ?for exposing him and proving him wrong?... this person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. he is not the usual sort of vandal but is rather knowledgeable in what hes dealing with. he could have been very valuable for wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. his edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. as i have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to usertony sidaway usercodex sinaiticus userisomorphic userwho userdbachmann the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.some external links on the issue my post on rovoam in wpani may rovoam and vandalism in wpani users discussion on how to deal with this vandal my report on rovoams vandalisms in wpvip may talkurartu as well as numerous posts in talknagornokarabakh talkcaucasian albania etc. jun utc~0

12339~there seems to be some conflict here. this is my first article so i didnt add much because i dont know all the guidelines yet. i went to get more information on the subject but when i came back i found a speedy deletion tag on my article. it said i didnt have enough information on the subject. i clicked edit this page added more info and when i saved it the speedy deletion warning disappeared. i did not remove it and if i did i didnt know that. im new here. if youre going to complain about my article look at other articles. some state police articles ive visited have only one or two sentences. i dont know why you guys are complaining at me. ill add more when i get the information. if you want to check more of my new articles go to list of law enforcement agencies in montana. i didnt write the billings pd and the montana state patrol articles.~0
12340~my understanding from reading the article is that the definitive biography of p. d. q. bach gives the dob as april and the dod as may its just his grave where the dates are shown the other way round followed by a question mark. on second thoughts the bracketed form for dob and dod in the lead might lend itself to the reverse order plus a question mark. i admit that my removing the circular link to badenbadenbaden was done from a wikiinstinct and not appropriate for this page. the dates altogether from the lead seems rather dour and i suggest to reinstate this or a similar versionp. d. q. bach may badenbadenbaden –? april leipzig ~0
12341~thats a red herring. this would only really be relevant to the warguilt argument if the armed forces of germanys allies had played an absolutely inconsequential role. determining the degree of damage caused by each belligerent is only relevant when working out the respective size of payments. when discussing who is responsible period then magnitude takes a back seat in my opinion. either way its not clear cut and i like your elaboration on that analogy.~0
12342~the track and field ban im sure theres some reason for this but i think this article needs to clarify his agreement on an eight year ban and now just recently it have been announced that he has received a four year ban. ive checked sources on this recent announcement and they indeed talk of a four year ban. so i wonder about the discrepency and think the article needs to explain that. —~0

12349~ calling for a movement to eliminate biritsh spelling on wikipedia this is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. it is not professional nonnpov and inconsistent that we have some articles with british spelling and others without. there are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively american such as the white house for example that have some words spelled the british way. this should not be and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.britian is the only englishspeaking country that uses their own unique variation of the english language and in british contexts thats usually fine. but every other englishspeaking country used the standard spelling which is generally based on how the word actually sounds and that should be the standard that wikipedia uses. it makes absolutely no sense to use one countrys variation of dialect no matter how big important or popular it is and completely disregard the rest of the englishspeaking worlds orrect usage of the language. in fact pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects the british version is favored. this also makes absolutely no sense. if the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way then its institutions endorsements and websites should speak/write that certain way too. it is understandable if this website was because that assumes that this is a primarily uk website. but this website is so it should follow the standard dialect that other .com use. this isnt in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. this is an encyclopedia and in encyclopedias information must be consistent and reliable. please take your time to think about this issue for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.thanks ~0

12358~the germany time line is quite correct for the northern hemisphere. my singers begin heat cycles in august and the second a few months later and sometimes a third end in mid winter. i have a male pup from a third heat cycle that was born in early spring like a wolf or coyote. this breeding only occurred because i had them separated for the first cycles thinking them over then put them back together. then the third happened with pregnancy as the result. heat periods in months or less is quite remarkable for any canine.~0

12360~ thank you for your input... this is exactly what the article needed. the parts of the article that are being removed are not significant parts and rather are blatant negative attacks. while i agree that lying to prospective students is not correct why must negative parts be highlighted? keep the facts and i use this word lightly with this group positive and help the school advance and produce better and more qualified physicians. prospective students can always call up their own state board or the schools offices and ask questions. if anyone has proof that the current administration or school officials are lying to students prospective or current about possible licensure issue or charter issues or anything for that matter then yes the school should have something formally brought against them. from what i see the school has been and is currently being investigated by the gmc. should the gmc find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away. portraying the situation as constantly negative helps no one at all. help correct the problem instead of being a problem im looking at of you and you know who you are and portray the positive side of things that several students despite this situation have gone on to be very successful. thank you again for impartial imput. august utc~0

12371~ what about the hillman minx? i dont see minx as an adjective. its a noun. using it to describe a cat seems redundant shes a minx means something like shes catty i thought a minx is some sort of fighting feline. the hillman minx car in the s was a very small automobile smaller than a volkswagen beetle its name probably meant to suggest that it was sprightly and energetic despite its tiny size and low power i only know of it that our family owned two of them a grey one with yellow earflaps and later a red one the minx could not go fast so its driver had to outwit other cars rather than overtaking them.... perhaps the minx relies more on wit and slyness than on physical strength? ~0

12377~i wasnt speaking of the hebrew spellings of samael verses samuel but the way the hebrew name shemuwel was transliterated by the latin speaking people of rome to samuel which is almost the same as samael. obviously because the jews did say that samael was the patron of rome so they must have took it to heart and decided to venerate him instead of choosing a true translieration of shemuwel. i was being funny when i said latinese. it is still proper english though. i dont have to speak the queens english. as far as sammy davis jr was concerned he said before he died that the only reason he joined the church of satan was for the chicks. ... ~0
12378~what i consider a fact i do so on a scientific basis. theres nothing to be gained nowadays by clinching on to the insane idea that the apollo hoax was for real. it stands in the way of actual moon landings. for now before we can actually attempt landing something on the moon we have to take the needless detour of explaining to all and sundry how apollo was a tragic hoax. we could have maybe actually landed people on the moon in the late s or something had it not been for the persistent recirculation of this chunky piece of baloney called the apollo missions. i rest my case.~0

12393~surely user ... is a sock puppet as is standard practice with certain users and their preferred admins the old story is being repeated and i hope it is noticed by neutral administrators who can take both corrective action as well as let contributors like me know if at all anything has been done wrongly or in error otherwise. the above user has once again like a trained puppet in the hands of his masters chosen to parrot words passing comments on my contributions rather than discussing the content. surely his observations a no professional standard might be to an extent valid in that i am not a trained in editing in placing the references in article but certainly i cannot be faulted for getting and sourcing the right references and that too utterly reputable and hence verifiable completely genuine and original references i hope original referencing is not dubbed as original research which i do know is not permitted in wikipedia. sourcing and repeating the findings of epigraphists archaeologists of national and international repute the epigraphists include some international ones too is somehow being considered wrong and instead of directly discussing the subject i have of course placed huge material on this very talk page but that has not been touched at all but the same source or k. sastri has been sourced and used in other pages but different yardstick is being followed by admins with regard to the page on the cholas.the above users comment on the standard c and cis completely false and is an utter lie for the sources are available both in print and on the web for all to see. certainly only a blind person could not see and place the sources referred and quoted.i am sure neutral admins will see and intervene in the right manner.~0

12398~found something already livingstone claiming holyroyd wallace were both in clockwork orange here in an independent article from may .my allegations were that a small group of mi and mi officers conspired to wreck the ceasefire negotiated between the labour government and the ira in february in the years that followed i submitted more than questions about the dirty war in ireland and after years of denial the government was forced to admit that the intelligence services had engaged in a covert black propaganda campaign codenamed clockwork orange.colin wallace a former army intelligence officer who had been one of my two key sources of information was found to have been framed for manslaughter and was eventually compensated. my second source captain fred holroyd who worked for mi was discredited by being committed to a psychiatric hospital and has never received the compensation that is his due.the spymaster peter wright of spycatcher fame makes no mention in his book of the extensive work he undertook in ireland yet he was the central figure among the group of mi officers trying to bring down the labour government this being the allegation eminating from holroyd not wallace. i believe that the most likely scenario is that wright and others directed the murder of green and the miami showband killings in order to deny the minority labour government the popularity that would have followed from its concluding apeace deal with the ira.this facet of the alledged conspiracy against wilson isnt currently reflected in the article nor to be fair in the holroyd article. like i said i will revert next week once i have the book from holroyd then i will be able to quote direct from it and add further details to holroyds allegations of a conspiracy against wilson. thanks ~0

12447~ ported to more platforms than any other operating system im not normally one to comment in talk sections like this but if ever there were a statement that could use a big old citation needed link this would be one. as best as i can find netbsd supports more platforms than linux. i am not a netbsd user and i am a linux user. regardless if the statement is correct it should include some citations. if it is not correct then perhaps a simple rephrasing to the effect of been ported to more hardware platforms than most other operating systems or been ported to many additional hardware platforms. just thoughts. ~0
12448~i dismiss your rfci dismiss your rfc as nothing but harassment pure and simple. why do you hate religion? am i not allowed to edit on wikipedia because i am not a radical secularist? i point out that your stereotypes about evangelicals dont apply to everyone and what do you do you remove it? am i supposed to stop being an orthodox catholic to edit wikipedia? or do you have to be a committed atheist to be credible? it seems that you arent interested in discussing the issues from an uninvolved thirdperson perspective but instead it seems you use wikipedia to grind an axe against christianity.how can you say that the crop of articles your work on are neutral when there are many inaccuracies and stereotypes etc. about politically active christians found within? christian reconstructionism is an outgrowth of calvinist theology plain an simple. how can you say that i am pov pushingdoes npov equal secular leftism? the dominionism article is heavily slanted to the left politically and i havent violated any rules by posting a pov tag there. much of what i have read form people such as yurica bokaer etc. is nothing but guilt by association.the edit warring has come from your side from the beginning. chip berlet is a political operative who isnt schooled in theology and his observations paint with a broad brush lacking historical insights into christian views on church and state. this isnt a personal attack. there shouldnt be a pro or an antidominionist bias. your stated commitment to paint dominionism as a threat is hardly npov. ~0

12450~expertise? i hope youre not suggesting ive become the goto admin for topic bans? dreadful fate. either an or ani would work. theoretically community topic ban proposals are supposed to go on an because theyre not about one incident and because an isnt archived as quickly. but the preference for an is becoming more and more a dead letter. in practice proposals for topic bans are often put on ani perhaps because it gets more traffic or perhaps sometimes because its the only admin noticeboard the op knows about. however. the user seems to have resigned themselves to consensus and is apparently on board with the dr being closed. in such a situation youre never going to get a topic ban just because theyre rude. its rather strange the way theyve been attacking you i agree but i think the best thing you can do is walk away. ive put a note on their page to urge them to disengage too. talk .~0

12476~hi. i will work through an example for you. in most western economies money borrowed to invest is tax deductible. in other words you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a carry trade in assets cash bonds or commodities.so lets say the hypothetical carry trader as typically depicted in the financial media is borrowing yen at % and investing in us treasuries or overnight repos at .%. sounds like a profitable trade right? read on.now consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of %. and consider that japan has been in deflation for the past number of years at deflationary rate of %. in the same time period us inflation has been running at roughly .%.the real cost aftertax cost of yen = nominal aftertax cost rate of inflation.the real return on usd assets = nominal aftertax returns rate of inflation.so for the yen borrowing the calculation is % % = % % = %and for the usd investment = .% % = .% .% = .%so the real rate of return on usd investment is .% while the real cost of yen borrowing is %. since the real cost of yen borrowing exceeds the real return on usd investment a socalled carry trade should not have an expectation of profit.hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.therefore it can be argued that all the talk in the financial media or even in the economist about a socalled profitable carry trade is complete nonsense. it is true that there might be some speculators who have placed and done well with bets against the yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the s but to confuse such with a profitable carry trade defies logic.~0

12509~ i need an advocate and help with mediation greetingsi need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.i am trying to get the following added to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. max tegark is a renown physicist and a phd profressor of cosmology at mit. he agrees with my addition.i am having problem with an editor by the name of lethe who follows me around wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.i have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages but he refuses to read what i write.advantages of mwiif hugh everetts theory was just another interpretation of quantum mechanics it would have no followers especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates poppers criteria for a good scientific theory. the reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the copenhagen interpretation among which are the following. quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. the copenhagen interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. aside from the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the copenhagen interpretation. in response to it he said god does not play dice with the universe.. it eliminates the measurement problem.. it eliminates von neumanns boundary problem where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies and the macro world where it does not. shortly before his death in albert einstein wrote like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon the same must also hold for the atomic objects as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.. it eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.. it restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. shortly before his death albert einstein also wrote observation cannot create an element of reality like a position there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position already before the observation has been actually made.. the waveparticle duality paradox evaporates. it simply and naturally explains the doubleslit experiment. richard feynman said the doubleslit experiment has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. in reality it contains the only mystery. david deutcsh wrote . . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the doubleslit experiment.. schrodingers cat paradox evaporates.it seems einsteins main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the copenhagen interpretation than with quantum mechanics itself. while mwi does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle it is a step on the way to stephen hawkings no boundary proposal and max tegmarks all universe hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle. ~0

12512~ not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer all three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death the film occupation the guardian and time state that she was killed by a bulldozer whether you want to call it an accident or not. trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed such as debris falling from the bulldozer as the idf reworded it is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the idf from having any direct responsibility for the action. none of the three sources state it was caused by debris. so the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught underneath. currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. the part about the idf referencing debris should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. here is what they do say. part of after about the film occupation states she got caught underneath the bulldozer when rachel corrie was killed she was protecting a doctors home the u.s. congress has refused her parents request for an independent investigation in her murder. this source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. . corrie was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in rafah gaza as she protested against house demolitions. the guardian. this newspaper simply states she was crushed to death by the bulldozer.. rachel corrie was a yearold american from olympia wash. who was crushed to death by an israeli army bulldozer march . corrie was in the gaza strip working with the international solidarity movement which opposes israel’s occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and living among palestinians whose homes were being demolished. she was kneeling in front of a home acting as a human shield when she was bulldozed. time. again here we are told she was crushed to death and bulldozed. nothing about debris accidentally falling.i or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. how exactly it killed her whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her is speculative. none of the three sources reference debris. if the idf debris statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. the idf operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.id feel better if it said something like she was crushed by a bulldozers operations clearing land in front of a palestinian doctors home. an idf investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.source??more accurate for the idf part of it would be by debris falling from the bulldozer. id probably rather it say the idf claimed rather than reported but im not going to change that part. ~0
12513~ characteristic saffirsimpson cat cyclone larry central pressure mbar mbar when landfall made potential damages more extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. major erosion of beach areas. terrain may be flooded well inland. % of all buildings in innisfail damaged. entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. rooves stripped of countless buildings some buildings flattened entirely. extensive flooding. universal power outages sewage system fails. airports closed for the day. storm surge.–. m.m minute average sustained winds kph km/h confirmed. otherwise unknown with gusts frequently exceeding kph. conclusion larry is indeed a category cyclone at the very least unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of km/h of confirmed sustained wind.i already have an article american claiming it was cat . its right here. however as you stated earlier newsgroups are not an authority on the matter are they? as for my friend well what can i say to you? you have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because i cant confirm km/h of sustained wind. im unsure if you even know what logic is. to you its all cold hard data with stupidty thrown in for free. your level of intelligence sickens me. youve also failed to note the case for central pressure which was on par with most cat storms. what youre proposing is this a cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical category storm and that had the central pressure of a typical category storm is in fact a mere category simply because its confirmed/measured sustained winds were knots below the cutoff for category .for the rest of you ss scale uses minute averages. a minute average of km/h was recorded about km north of where the cyclone crossed. i understand this is km/h less than the cut off for cat as stated above but at least it puts estimates and whatnt to rest. further ill leave the rest of my argument to logic that is if you have any.listen to me very carefully. beauty may fade but dumb is forever. ~0

12516~no at least not for cryptographic steganography. i should say first that steganography is a much slipperier subject than cryptography its harder to specify and analyze. but a spreadspectrum signal need not be any harder to detect than a narrowspectrum. a signal that is transmitted at a very low bitrate may be difficult to detect but even this is not necessarily true. in steganography the message is normally hidden inside another message. the study of analog technical ways to transmit signals secretly is not really within the purview of steganography it includes tricks like lineofsight infrared lasers transmissions as short high data rate bursts and other esoteric tricks. jan utc~0

12520~ dithering here... im sorry we havent met sooner. there is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with. his name is usertharkuncoll an anglosaxonist. english traditionalists even the proceltic proroman are apparently the bane of the british isles here at wikipedia but i dont know about that in real life considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant. yes its said to be more accepting than the proud teutonic approach to english identification although it seems as though the celtofascists here are trying to spin the english alone as foreign to the isles even though it is easy to discover the celtic origins in roman europe especially the brythonic kind as much as anglosaxon european ties are to the postclassical rome of charlemagne and other holy roman germanics. they think that proceltic proroman means hostile cultural appropriation as they have identified you as the other the big pink elephant in the room. it is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile mutualexclusionary factions of celt roman and german for most people involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another but hardly any singular romanists im afraid. perhaps i should try that. imagine the doublewhammy of negativity from the celtogermanicists. ahh...theres no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed it seems.incidentally if youd like to get worked up elsewhere go check out the archives of that talk page...here for instance. in that article it is apparently considered nonsense by that the greeks bestowed the name british isles upon that set of islands off of gaul and that is the ultimate origin as they instead focus exclusively upon the tudorstuart settlement extreme violation of wpweight and barely even narrowly wpsynth so wrapped up in violations of wpnor which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect nor do they care to see that roman britain was only that part of albion that part of the bi in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by rome even as erin would go free...not contradicting the fact that they are both british whatever that originally meant aside from the trojan story. just about any and all bi related pages are vicious black holes and often the only way to go about it is by using extreme caution and wisdom. you will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you dont fit their profile then you are wrong not just what you happen to do or write it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works. many times after selecting a target they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough they will have provoked thee into becoming banned just to see you squirm as they do whatever it is they wish to put the spin on this or that subject according to their absolutist truisms. of course you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins wont even bother to level the playing field for you only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery. they will most likely base their complaints upon improper procedures which is orwellian codespeak for we dont like what he stands for lets overwhelm him in numbers.all said it is very nice to meet you...you like me with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving would probably enjoy this a lot. ive been a fan for the longest time of you tharkuncoll ~0

12537~a child born to a portuguese parent is automatically a portuguese citizen provided the parent was born in portugal portuguese nationality law. which part did you not understand? she did not only apply for citizenship she only regularized her papers. she could have done it at age . she would be portuguese all the way. in canada you have one month to register a child in portugal for those born abroad there is no time limit to register. i will give you an easy example i child born in canada before being registered is not canadian? so all the children that are born in canada and die before being registered are foreighners the problem i have with the consensus version. it is not a consensus not everybody agrees. you were given references. citizenship as you are awareit is not the same as nationality. and writing she is canadian with portuguese nationality would be misleading too. . she is no more canadian than she is portuguese. i can only understand your reasons as being you have any valid reason please state it. ~0
12538~im sorry but any livejournal friends are irrelevant to this topic. if you are referring to myself telling nidara that i had asked some people to review the article yes i did. however they werent friends and the didnt pile on they simply reviewed it and commented on it. i dont see what youre trying to accomplish by pointing this out. have you filed the rfc yet? i will if you have not. ~0
12539~blatantly wrong and misleadingthere are elements about this article that are just flat out wrong. it implies that technotronic and vanilla ice were somehow involved with njs omg so wrong and then blatantly states most notably raphael saadiq r. kelly tlc dallas austin boyz ii men sean diddy combs will smith ll cool j and many others.will smith represents the golden age of hip hop and ll cool j? come on ll did not become known for njs. he was an early pioneer underground? yes. socially conscious rap? yes. hardcore rap? yes. battle rap? yes. years is a long time and a lot of styles... but new jack? give me a break. someone really needs to clean up this article. its like someone just put a lot of names in here to give it multiple points of index reference. ~0

12544~thank you i have checked my email and found a delivery failure well buried too i have sent ralf vandebergh another request and expect it wont be too long before he replies id say give it a few weeks as he might travel or not i dont know what his schedule is. to put your mind at ease a little i had organized through ralf for his portrait to be released its on his article page. its not a selfportrait but its the one he suggested and sent to me and it looked fine in my opinion for inclusion. so he is keeping in touch with me and it shouldnt take too long. something i brought up in the email i just sent is the option of people giving me permission to act on their behalf in these cases do you know what form i can send to them for that so i can release their pictures as i see fit that would simplify things i think. chris peat from heavensabove is just like yep go for it anything i like from his site so it would be good if i get a once only form for these people and they can suggest to me conversationally what theyd like to do rather than use the forms all the time. talk ~0

12546~ february utcyour outline looks good to me. one point though theres no need to separate every smallest component of a rig into an article of its own or to have a separate article for highspeed and lowspeed mals until the articles grow too big. parachuting is too big at the moment it should be split to several articles. however there is no information on malfunctions at the moment so there is no justification for creating separate articles for them just yet. ~0

12566~ suggested that we may want a hatnote because it summarized quite well the purpose of the article. i find nothing in wphatnote to indicate that this is a valid usage of hatnotes. i find it hard to believe that someone looking at this article was actually looking for a list of random scientists which appears to be the stated purpose of hatnotes in this context. does anyone have another reason why there should be a hatnote or disagree with my assessment? ~0

12577~i think serven made an error on the patent numbers then.the citation you removed is the us patent office database theres no way to link directly to an individual patent there which is the reason i cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. take a look at it isnt issued to colt it has nothing to do with guns and it was issued in the wrong year. then take a look at x for a revolver issued to s. colt on feb. . for both of those you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see then click the option to see images there are no transcriptions but they have scans of the original documents.the link i gave above xpatent discusses the patents that were destroyed. prior to and the fire that destroyed the patent offices copies of those first patents patents werent numbered. after the fire in the patent office started numbering all new patents beginning at . they also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents and numbering them as they found them but beginning with x. so prefire and earlier patents are xseries postfire patents dont have the x. the patent colt was issued in was an xseries patent because it was issued before the fire. anything without an x cant be the right patent number for that date.when sources conflict we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. and the actual scans maintained by the patent office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.~0

12582~although it was deleted i may still bring it back. but following comments from the ga reviewer i tried to break down the rolling stock section which meant i mainly left the hst section and moved the refurbishment section to a new refurbishment section and the formation section was deleted. i may re word the hst section sometime soon to incoporate the main parts of the formation section it must be noted that this is the only company that has this much detail on rolling stock. if i bring it back i can copy and paste it from the edit history which is built in to wikipedia i will probably incoporate the most useful parts.~0
12583~ ban or block? as i understand it a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed arbcom or jimbo wales by fiat for whatever reason and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or ip address for predetermined reasons usually vandalism sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings. they can both be for a set time or permanent. bans can be permanent blocks of user accounts can be permanent but we dont like to permablock ip addresses. as in the case of jessica i blocked what i believe to be her ips for mos. so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. known shared ips are blocked for much less time. admins are supposed to use arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans but dont themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. that way admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds but bans from above cant be lifted by admins. again this is only how i understand it others will have their own opinions to be sure. cheers ~0
12584~ suburban service reduction the may timetable brought a reduction in the stopping service between marylebone and high wycombe/princes risborough with the result that stations such as denham currently only have one train per hour in each direction offpeak where previously they had two. in the midst of the mid and longdistance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article i feel this ought to be commented upon. at the time i thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service longer platforms higher frequency stops at both south ruislip and west ruislip trains with faster acceleration – in short something approaching an overgroundstyle service but as of may that hasnt happened and despite all the excitement about the mainline service to birmingham the service has worsened significantly for the shortdistance user. ...~0

12587~ i know you are writing these things in good faith yop but your claim that warrens skin or hair color calls into question her claim to native ancestry is offensive. on that logic the racial identity of everyone who identifies as racially mixed but looks white should be questioned. the difference between warren and whitelooking mixed people such as mariah carey and rashida jones is that the latter have actual identifiable parents or grandparents who are racial minorities african american. on the other hand all of warrens ancestors are white. that is why she was and is criticized for this she said she was a minority when her whole familyincluding distant ancestorsis lilywhite. finally it is preposterous to suggest that warren looks minority in the picture you wish to insert in the article. she looks completely white in all pictures. while some people who look white are multiracial in her case she looks white because she is fully white. ~0

12591~omit fox admission of common currency intentsomeone did the same to the independent task force on north america page which had this supposed admission by vincente fox on larry king the other night that plans were afoot to bring in a common na currency.this is covered on the talk page there here is the transcript of the supposed admission.king email from mrs. gonzalez in elizabeth new jersey. mr. fox i would like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a latin america united with one currency?fox long term very long term. what we propose together president bush and myself its alca which is a trade union for all of the americas. and everything was running fluently until hugo chavez came. he decided to isolate himself. he decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea...king its going to be like the euro dollar you mean?fox well that would be long long term. i think the processes to go first step into is trading agreement. and then further on a new vision like we are trying to do with nafta.it would seem that in discussing a possible process for a latin american common currency the phrase like we are trying to do with nafta in discussing enhancing trade agreements is an admission that currency union itself is on the table. at least thats the claim from some and conservapedia for one has this on their home page. ~0
12592~sentencepardon me if i make a mistake here i havent had breakfast and im about to go out. re when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is. the reference only provides one example accepted to college. as far as ive read the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long but in a dialect form for longer. sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again to be defended on its age. would not it not be clearer to elaborate on linguistic matters? it is difficult to guess them solely from one example that an expression is newer than it actually is. if the sentence were clearer it would easier to verify it. ~0

12600~by now ive written or rewritten most of the peoples park article. i was there from the beginning because jon read my former employer was the landscape architect responsible for the parks initial design. he also provided the tools to build it and donated many of the materials. that first weekend was terrific i drove my truck the one pictured in the hippie travel section up to the site and parked it in the middle of the park as it developed around me. my good friend david garthwaite convinced his sister terry that they should play music so the joy of cooking jammed all day. i cooked food for the crowd in my truck and worked laying sod. returned home at the end of the weekend tired and happy.when they fenced off the park my truck was still parked in the boneyarda place at th and delaware in berkeley where a number of people were building boats vans and so on. my neighbor alan blanchard had said goodbye to his wife sheila and gone up to telegraph ave. to work at the berkeley reperatory theater doing carpentry. he heard some noise on the street went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an alameda county sheriffs deputy. he never saw another thing as he was permanently blinded. james rector who was standing next to him had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen. he died four days later.i was in sproul plaza for rectors memorial service just after he died. the national guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward while helicoptors dropped cs gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled. walking home after this gathering we were assaulted by national guard troops. that night i defied the curfew and drove my truck all around berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark and it was obviously a hippie truckyet they never stopped me even at the roadblocks which i ignored.yes a whole other s saga. still makes me sad about alanhis wife left him and whenever i saw him after that he commented that he realized he would always remember me as he saw me on the last day he was sighted. ~0

12611~theres no need for an ad hominem argument opinoso nor an attack. my point remains tables text additions etc should be handled individually gradually and consulting other editors prior to their inclusion because of this articles peculiar size constraints and the amount of effort all editors including joão felipe to cut down the articles size. all the content ive removed can and should be easily added to the respective subarticles. tables are helpful but take up a lot of physical space and dataagain perfectly apt to be relocated to subarticles. everyone has to resist this temptation to include all this data into a single article.~0

12624~to all interested parties for those who are interested for the arguments the sockpuppet khoikhoi who has created this article presents for the application of the npov tag and later even totally disputed tag without giving any reasons which is vandalism and a blatant violation of any rules is as follows because this article presents sentences as absolute fact that are backedup by slovak sourcesin other words the use of slovak sources is considered pov by him although i have used the currently best scientific demographic and etnogpraphic sources existing in this area. secondly i will restore all sourced information that has been deleted by another sockpuppet of the userarpad and futher attempts to remove such information will be treated according to wikipedia rules. further corrections of the text of this and the magyarisation article for the relativisation of which this article has been explicitely created by user khoikhoi will follow later on. ~0

12641~ bektashi may i learn what was racist in the sample jokes i put in humor legacy section in the bektashi article and why they were deleted? i cant believe this is serious. i am strongly offended with this meaningless accusation. i guess you consider them offensive against sunni muslims but they are not considered offensive by sunni muslims in turkey these jokes are also common among them. moreover bektashis and sunni muslims share the same religion ethnicity and culture so there is no westernsense racial discrimination between them. even if we assume that the jokes could be considered offensive today from a universal perspective which i dont agree as a muslim this wouldnt make inclusion of them in an encyclopedia racist because they tell something about the culture and its history. censoring these jokes simply means ignoring the culture which is indeed undemocratic let alone being unrealistic. will we delete the article about satanic verses because it is considered offensive by many muslims? whatever your response is to my opinions regardless of how we end up with this article i am expecting an apology for the racism comment. it should not be this easy to label people as racist. ~0

12649~thanks mackan for the assist. i am not sure i follow all points contested above if anyones wondering no i did not find the oafishness or general vulgarity of mind displayed on that talk page to be lovable. i am not particularly exercised about this and though i think the block was illegitimate i have no plan to pursue the matter further. the only statement in this thread that i find objectionable is shells professed wish to see me take civility more seriously in the future. i take civility very seriously shell indeed i believe i take it more seriously than you do. i think your careless suggestion to the contrary – like the illconsidered block itself – reflects a slack even indefensible understanding of wpcivil wherein the only measure of incivility is the temperature of remarks. i am also a little puzzled by your reading of nine or ten identical fratboy beer belches as a commendable effort to keep things light. we all have different sensibilities and youre certainly entitled to yours. but be aware that here is my attempt to keep things light in the face of obstructionism. note that in this case there is a point to the playfulness the weight authority influence and reliability of sources is not – contra jayjg – a function of their print run. jays response to this lightness was to say again and again that i had strawmanned him while steadfastly refusing to clarify his point or show how id distorted it then to attack me directly and personally and say ive never in the past shown the grace or honesty to admit when ive lied about such matters and so was unlikely to admit my deceptions in this instance. and then began the beerbelching fratboy hazing extravaganza you found so commendably charming. all of this in a thread that began with jays personal attack on pr alongside the spurious point downplaying haaretz as a source – the same spurious point all subsequent accurate references to which he dismissed as strawmen. one girls trash is anothers treasure shell and while you have the right to be charmed by what you find charming you shouldnt conclude that those with different sensibilities have manners less beautiful than yours. suffering fools gladly is not the only measure of wikipedia etiquette. ~0

12659~handle in text it is not clear exactly what the alternative to this rfc proposal is or what a no or yes might yield so i will spell out what i see here as the best solution. i agree with gamaliel and nomoskedasticity that this is a blp issue and that using filipino alone is utterly unacceptable and pov. i do think filipinoamerican correctly describes the subject of the article and is not an indication of citizenship but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used. however per theredpenofdoom and markbernstein i think that this may be best handled as bbb and seb suggested and how the lead is now worded which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence but instead unpack it spell out in more detail the actual facts in an npov manner in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes. this works and does not take sides in the serious blp issue. we further make clear how vargas selfidentifies which i think is important here without having wikipedia editors take a position. as markbernstein said we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere and trpod is right about disclaimers etc. sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. we also had the same kind of issue at believe it or not bee gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called english australian or manx we handled it by leaving off the nationality and the wars stopped. so i support this wording jose antonio vargas born february is a journalist filmmaker and immigration activist. born in the philippines and raised in the united states from the age of he was part of the washington post team... etc. /talk ~0

12664~re qazakhdear khoikhoi thanks for your mediation effort on this one. i agree to the general spirit of text you posted. but i would like to hightlight some corrections/additions which i highlighted in bold below. under the russian empire the rayon was an northeastern part of the kazakh uyezd of the elisavetpol guberniya.. useraivazovsky needs to cite the references where he got the figures % armenians and % azerbaijanis from.. this sentence does not reflect the historical realityafter the british left and more fighting between armenians and azeris ensued bolshevik forces gained control of the region and annexed it to the soviet unionbritons have left caucasus in while bolsheviks took over azerbaijan first in caucasus on april armenia was taken by bolsheviks in november . soviet union was created in . so obviously bosheviks could not have annexed it to the soviet union. kazakh uyezd was part of azerbaijan elisavetpol governorate was designated so by britons which under bolshevik rule was divided between armenia and azerbaijan.. neither country has disputed this boundary since quote is not true. armenia occupied one of the exclaves of kazakh rayon called yuxari askipara during active phase of war. ~0

12676~thanks again ja. in the ockhams razor article we have the origins of what has come to be known as occams razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as john duns scotus – thomas aquinas c. – and even aristotle – bc charlesworth . the term occams razor first appeared in in the works of sir william rowan hamilton – long after ockhams death circa . ockham did not invent the razor so its association with him may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it ariew . and though he stated the principle in various ways the most popular version was written not by himself but by john ponce of cork in thorburn .i count three external references and no unfortunately. also a google search site +unfortunately returns only aristotle with a similar phrasing referring to an nonextant treatise. at the minimum i would prefer the removal of unfortunately or a weaker rephrasing along the lines of unfortunately for historians of science with an internal wikilink to ockhams razorhistory. thanks ~0

12691~ill explain it again shall i. bilinge hospital was closer to wigan than it was to st helens. by road billinge hospital to st helens= . miles st helens to whiston hospital= . miles. why would someone drive to billinge from the middle of st helens when thier wife was giving birth when they could be at whiston faster? what would be the point?. why would i want to put wigan in every article. a good per cent of the metropolitan borough of wigan were born at billinge hospital not just the immediate area i. orrell pem ince etc etc. a much smaller percentage of the of the met borough of st helens i.e. rainford haydock garswood billinge chapel end were born there most were born at whiston including those from the centre of st helens as whiston is closer. why is this not reflected in the article? i put the word wigan in the article when it needs to be in it i.e. bilinge hospital was the prnciple maternity facility for the wigan and northern st helens areas. what is wrong about that?~0

12694~multiple editors on this page have repeatedly stated their opinion that this information is not relevant because it is not notable in gordimers life. editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not at this point notable. the onus is on the editors seeking inclusion of the material. lquilter three or four editors have censored the section in question ten have maintained it. the three or four are very loud and aggressive and claim to represent a consensus that is just the rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning claiming that ones opinion represents the popular will in order to con new people into adopting it and thus bring about a selffulfilling prophecy.but consider this. the censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago see my earlier note for date. it took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of statesanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. and so the significance of the attack on gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than i had previously known. and yet the censors are unmoved by this news. imagine if the races were reversed. they would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. but they do not want anyone to know about the south african genocide. apparently some cases of genocide are more equal than others.editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not at this point notable.as lquilter well knows i have responded many times. he is simply trying to rewrite history.the onus is on the editors seeking inclusion of the material. the heck it is. you and your two or three comrades have repeatedly deleted what nine people had worked on before i ever came along. as you well know i only got involved in this because i was disgusted by your censorship i still am. it is you and your comrades who must justify your campaign to suppress all mention of this horrible incident and the campaign out of which it grew. ~0

12710~ deletion user gogododo deleted an article i created ostensibly under notability guidelines with no debate or any chance for me to respond to his allegation. notability guidelines as i understand them are loose enough that in the case of the article that was deleted the bare minimum of politeness would have necessitated some period of debate or discussion as to determine notability. his contribution was certainly not constructive and yet no one is affixing warnings to his talk page. this is a great way to drive new editors away and to restrict wikipedia into the oligarchical domain of a nerd elite.~0

12715~the point remains that louis dauphin of france is an unacceptable title for this persons article. what makes him the dauphin? there were other dauphins named louis most notably the son of louis xvi. i think that if this person is never referred to as louisferdinand the dauphin since he does seem to be referred to as louisferdinand the best title would be louis dauphin of france as usermcferran suggested.~0

12717~pechers additions to the artcile the new sections highly subjective and inappropriate for wikipedia as it is as pointed out by other users loosely based on unverifiable sources. currently these new sections are in breach of wpv npov and wpor. i will try to trim/remove some of the controversial claims untill sources have been legitimately referenced by citations that meet verifiability standards as speculatios has no place on wikipedia. however these new new sections especially safavids need to be rewritten as the basic interface is far away from being encyclopedic.~0

12720~i can see a clear distinction between reformed egyptian and book of mormon languages though i agree the term is a bit ambiguous and might be expected to mean the languages the book of mormon was written in. is there possibly a better title for the article? how about linguistics and the book of mormon d? sorry. to tell the truth linguistics and the book of mormon does probably encompass that subject and i am not sure how to break it out cleanly. hmm. could you start for now with a section of linguistics?~0
12721~ending this controversy you serbs and albanians cant understand anything with the likes of montenegro. one the region of krajë is a geographical and tribal region and not just a village. it contains many villages. two in montenegrin and any other language that sprang from serbocroatian krajë is called krajina and this is a fact. you can ask people in bar and ulcinj if they can understand the montenegrin language about krajina.three this is an albanian majority region which yes indeed it was was once a part of albania before the treaty of berlin in .four this region is also part of malesija the montenegrin part of malsia a region in northern albania.ok. just to clear things up.~0
12722~there is nothing to discuss because there is no logical reason given for the removal of this paragraph. if the article is too short in your opinion then you should lengthen it not shorten it even more. where is the precedent or rule at wikipedia that says if an article is short you should remove any negative documented history from the article? the logic is absurd. i can very well say the article is too short for a section on recent fundraising and just decide to remove that. what compromise are you looking for? i readded a link to the article and a very brief paragraph and apparently that is too much for you and that ideologue derex. you removed the item you need to give a logical explaination for your actions. the article is too short doesnt cut it. ~0

12731~this user has a limited history and is not a registered user so i am replying here instead of on the talk page where they sent me a note personally. the user mentioned wikiproject albums. however that project is not relevant to this page since that policy applies to album articles this is not and in actually makes no comment at all about which albums should be included on an artists article i just read the page. the policy that actually applies to this page is wikiproject musicians and it does not say anywhere that the article should include all albums where mayer is a primary contributor. or any other artist. the policy there is rough and incomplete. thus i have been operating on precedent as well as what makes the most sense and what is most fair to the works. works done by a band should be credited to the band as a whole not an idividual since that just isnt fair. additionally wikipedia has a long history of separating the discography of an idividual from that of the musical group they were/are in. here a few examples jack white john phillips david ruffin sly stone larry graham nick lachey brian wilson tina turner nicky wire michelle williams singer mick jagger agnetha fältskog john entwistle vince neil stanley clarke robert plant frank black darren hayes mark burgess musician annifrid lyngstad graham coxon john lennon steve howe guitarist neil finn roger daltrey smokey robinson gladys knight randy bachman robert wyatt biosphere musician individual members of the beach boys james dean bradfield joey eppard steve marriott grant mclennan tony banks musician sisqó alex chilton bob mould jim capaldi and there are many more.many of these discographies have notes that wikilink to the appropriate article for the full band discograhy. therefore in the insterest of consistency that same model should be applied here. ~0

12741~first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for yepess death. and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious...second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and yepes invented his tenstring guitar. as i said bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then but the first yepestype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar. moreover ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar. this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical. it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings. you want a verifiable source? here ramirez iii jose. . the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar. bold strummer. pp. . isbn third i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar. furthermore yepes frequently uses the th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor th higher than the th string. moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions. being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepess entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. this has nothing to do with yepess own performance practice on his instrument. as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepess leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about. yepes even frets a and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing.~0

12751~ about nonexistent kingdom of croatia in order to get a good understanding of the croatian history here are very good references showing clearly that kingdom of croatia existed only years and namely from kings bishops nobles and burghers in medieval hungary by erik fugedi janos m. bak erik feugedi published by variorum reprints the realm of st stephen a history of medieval hungary by pal engel published by i. nobility land and service in medieval hungary by martyn rady published by palgrave macmillan a history of hungarys nationalities by ernst flachbarth published by society of the hungarian quarterlyp hungary in the late fifteenth century a map showing wallachia hungary and turkey and ragusa no clue about kingdom of croatia the medieval world by peter linehan janet laughland nelsonp figure . map of medieval hungary showing areas of cuman settlement times of king bela v no clue about kingdom of croatiamore interesting ... tab the early medieval balkans a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century by john van antwerp fine published by university of michigan presspage sources on medieval croatiaearly medieval croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle the more you study the less you know. when i was and undergraduate studying balkan history i thought i knew quite a bit about croatia but as i study more about croatia one by one facts that i knew before turn out to be dubious based on questionable sources or no sources at all. most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval croatia is extremely poor and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.much of the information about medieval croatian history comes from later seveneenth and eigteenthcentury narrative histories. these were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not. the realm of st stephen a history of medieval hungary by pál engel i. edition translated by tamas palosfalvipages one of ladislauss most significant achievements was the occupation of hungarys southern neighbour croatia. ... the small kngdom born in the tenth century streched from the kapela mountains to the adriatic sea its center being biograd located on the coast....king demetrius zvonimir who not being a member of the ruling dynasty obtained his throne throug election asked pope gregory vii fo a crown in and in return declared his kingdom as a papal fief. after his death ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister zvonimirs widow and had no difficulty in taking possession of croatia in . he bestowed the new kingdom together with royal title on his nephew almos son of geza i ...i further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary croatian historians ....the exclusive revelation is the result of scientific research by croatian historian dragutin pavlicevic and found its place in history books. the split newspaper feral tribune reveals that pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled croatian indians included in the second grade history textbook shedding new light on the history of native americans and their ties with croats one of the oldest nations in europe. he affirms that in north carolina a tribe has been living for more than centuries differing in the color of skin hair and facial features from other tribes. according to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe have the noble blood of ancient croats from dubrovnik in their veins. mr. pavlicevic also speaks about the mateo indians named after their ancestor mateo a croat named mate. in his work dragutin pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than million croatian descendants throughout the united states states the split newspaper....and this one form croats sailed to new world before columbus and vikingsandrija zeljko lovric bases his theory on recent archeological finds of islamic coins and glagolitic writings in paraguaya theory that croatian sailors in the service of the moorish caliphs probably reached the coasts of the americas not only before columbus but also before the vikings themselves may be corroborated by exceptiona~0

12757~ ban the reality of the matter is that every time varsovian returned to wikipedia he inserted himself /invented a new dispute. you accuse me of nationalistic persistent povpushing pursuit where exactly have i done that eh? what a joke you just made that up to justify your ban. jaroslaw bilaniuk jakiw palij and bohdan koziy are simply not poles if somebody tries to add the category polish nazi collaborator then he is simply trying to insert untrue information which needs to be removed. its as simple as that. did you care to check if there are any sources calling these guys polish nazi collaborators or is that falls outside your intellectual capabilities? how is removing wrong information persistent povpushing pursuit?i am a member of wiki projects i worked on many different topic areas and improved countless pages i have created new articles and a couple dyks as well. and what exactly has varsovian contributed to wikipedia apart from constantly creating disputes on polish topics? are you able to name one single page on which varsovian did some substantial work worthy of mention in one year of activity on wikipedia? i dont ask or pages but one single page. your systematic attempts at trying to equal me with varsovian are both shameful and disgraceful but i am not surprised. one can easily guess the morals of a person who blocked me for hours after i simply and politely asked if i am allowed to do something. or person who first refuses to do ae because there is lack of transparency and a problem with notification good one that one and then comes back a couple of hours later to do a revenge ae nobody requested. and miraculously the transparency which just a couple of hours earlier was this big problem is all of a sudden no problem at all. ~0

12802~nonscientific i guess this article breaks just about every rule there ever was about scientific method proving empirically that the study of biological systems is whats evolutionary and that the selfappointed experts are just at the beginning of the rationality / knowledge curve and not at the conclusion as they often make believe. this is really sad. its sad because with the kind of dogma unsupported by facts that this article contains there are two steps backwards for every step forward. evolutionary biologists really need to clean up their act and get serious. there is no credibility here compared to other hard sciences. they should take a note from physicists and chemists and really do more to prove their work instead of just transfixing themselves on convenient hypothesis and staking unsupportable claims.~0

12808~the gothic culture was a horror movement. the first goths look like corpses with white faces occult symbols etc. there was no aesthetic or romantic thing. this romantic thing is a phenomenon of the s or an influence of the new romantic movement and has nothing to do with the traditional gothic subculture. the same with gothic architecture gothic novels etc. the name of the gothic subculture came from the gothic music a dark punky music genre related to death rock and horrorpunk. there was no relation to the gothic architecture but a preference for dead and old buildings in ruins cemetaries symbols of decay etc. it was a death romanticism. the term gothic means dark gloomy spooky. i agree that there are new developments. but now you have a culture without any relation to the roots. metaller are listening to metal music punks are listening to punk music but goths are listening to futurepop metal and techno? bullshit theyre not goths theyre derivatives or parallel movements. btw do you have any reliable scientific source that definitions of gothic rock have shifted over the time? a drum machine was in use since the early days of gothic rock. its not a mids thing.~0

12867~what we are creating with wikipedia is not set in stone. it is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable and personally i dont agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of encyclopedia britannica. ive been around since jeh has been around since and dsimic has been editing a lot since in other words enough to get a very good idea of how wikipedias anarchist system works. im glad that jeh prefaced his statement with in my opinion because thats what wikipedia is about and no personal statement or even an essay such as commonlycited arguments to avoid essay is law. we debate a lot. i know just how much sucks but its the way it is. now whether or not product lists are notsogood articles is debatably if you youre axiologically inclined an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users or our editors if theyre not your priority. in my experience lists are great for their purpose and as a power wikipedia user and editor ive derived enormous benefit from them and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from say the dozens of references ive added to articles like tort trust law or economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. lists in general are not easy candidates for good articles as i recall back around or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories but when i pointed to wpcsl the steam was taken out even though that didnt change the sensibility of the decisions. in any case you are welcome to boldly make and advocate for changes and i reserve the right to express my own opposition within the limits of my available free time. as an aside i mention the views of users seriously it has been pretty well empirically shown that oldtimers like myself are actively hostile to newcomers as documented by aaron halfaker t c ~0

12881~ attempt at close of old rfc that is the rfc listed on archive of this talk page rfc does the article minimize the centrality of india to the notion of caste? that the discussion wasnt closed earlier is of little surprise it is long it is technical and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets such discussions are very much not like parmigianoreggiano. in fact the discussion is so long that youll have to accept the general conclusions i think i was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. what i as a nonhundiindian currently middleclass college professor conclude are the following pointsscholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to hindu india vice versa discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of hindu india to the very concept of caste.scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies esp. those outside se asia mostly seem to use the term in the broader sense signaled in various places in the rfcas a convenient shorthand for social stratification and such. i note also that the application of the term caste to some other cultures popular until the s and perhaps after has now come under academic scrutiny and criticism.considering those two points i conclude that it is the september version of the article does suffer from or and some coatracking the current version is much better in that respect though far from perfect. note for example the very loose use of the word caste in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of cagot. as it turns out there are sources comparing their segregation to that of the indian caste system such a comparison is perhaps valid but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.allow me a few observations and suggestions.caste should and this is supported in the rfc include extensive discussion of the situation in india.examples from other cultures some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles must of course be thoroughly verified an article from the independent cannot suffice for what is after all an encyclopedic article.i believe it is imperative and comments in the rfc and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this to come to a clarification of terms. the current lead does some of that already but a separate section is warranted. etymology should be the least important part of such a section more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. parts of the lead of the september version point to that as well whats important is to delineate the term and its currency. fowler cites balkin in the rfc social stratification in the united states does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole and its precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin caste system in india i read caste is neither unique to hindu religion nor to india caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world for example in the muslim community of yemen christian colonies of spain and japan with one reference possibly very outdated and another a newspaper article from the new york times. this is an article in which wikipedias crowdsourcing hey its in the paper lets add it needs to be held in check.in all i believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. it is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to caste system in india etc. its clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the september version was and that india must occupy a position of greater importance. in various places various quantified suggestions were made i cannot comment on those numbers. i sensed some hesitance at perhaps borrowing material from caste system in indiawell if thats where good content on the concept of caste its history and its usage can be found thats where you go. good luck. ~0

12886~while the circle notation for benzene is popular in high school teaching i have never seen a higherlevel organic chemistry textbook that uses it or met a practicing chemist who uses it. the kekule notation seems to be much more popular among chemists. it is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals i know whether published by the acs the rcs elsevier or wiley. in my opinion the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles polycyclic aromatic molecules reactive intermediates and reaction mechanisms the kekule notation makes electron counting and electron pushing much more straightforward. the circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation. ~0

12894~==notability of alden force== a tag has been placed on alden force requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done because the article appears to be about a real person organization band club company etc. or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. if this is the first page that you have created then you should read the guide to writing your first article.if you think that you can assert the notability of the subject you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subjects notability under wikipedia guidelines.for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies. feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. ~0
12895~this article uses a lot of spanish words that must be translated to english since this is the english version of wikipedia not everyone can understand charreadas amd corridas de toros and all those things. even the title is all in spanish~0
12896~ replaceable fair use image thanks for uploading image i noticed the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. if you believe this image is not replaceable please go to the image description page and edit it to add without deleting the original replaceable fair use template. on the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself.if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on this link. note that fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted days after this notification days if not used in an article per our fair use policy. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. tast ~0
12897~ a political statement in support of gender as an identity that one can decide.firstly i do not believe the issue the articles title involves chelsea did not decide to be born a woman in a mans body so to speak. i did not decide upon my identity straight male—i just am what i am. same goes for her. ~0
12898~wpindia banner/uttarakhand workgroup addition note project banner with uttarakhand workgroup parameters was added to this article talk page because the article falls under categoryuttarakhand or its subcategories. should you feel this addition is inappropriate please undo my changes and update/remove the relavent categories to the article wanna talk? ~0
12899~editing is it worth your life? excuse me elizabeth but i see that a lot of editors waste their life editing articles like hours a day. can you explain why?~0
12900~for me is evident that previous user is a great supporter of communist totalitarianism and i am against every kind of totalitarianism broz killed a lot of jugoslavs more than italians probably i am italian but jugoslav nationalist because i dont like wars interjugoslav republics for me is impossible an agreement with a communist who is against personal freedom~0
12901~eddie vedder fyi eddie vedder was in the spice girls. your page says you value acceptance. however your removal of this fact from the spice girls page really demonstrates your lack thereof.if you would like to experiment with reverting others updates please make use of wikipedias sandbox function. thank you.~0
12902~ welcoming hm? why couldnt someone welcome a new user until after their first edit? ive never heard that before actually i think welcoming people might even make them less likely to use that account for vandalism. well alright thats just a little hope of mine but still. cobra ~0
12903~ harrow doc james correctly reverted my removal of text cited to harrow noting that it is in fact a review although pubmed does not indicate so. however imo the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports. conclusions from pmid harrow overall the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. they do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period providing extensive evidence of samples of medicationfree schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes. is it at least a moderatesized number of schizophrenia patients who do well longitudinally without medications? this important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. the longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.the abovecited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about longterm treatment. discussions by whitaker moncrieff and others question longterm antipsychotic treatment.– these disparate views research by who and dosmed in developing countries and our own longitudinal studies– should be considered as prompts for further longterm outcome research on this important issue. this is not a strongly worded conclusion where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study. i continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text. clearly further research on this controversial matter is needed. can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match? the strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed. regards talk ~0
12904~ive reverted your changes to cuisine of argentina. for the record npov means neutral point of view. germanic influence in argentine cuisine is no doubt small compared to italian/spanish influence so comparatively small is wellphrased. besides your change left the rest of the sentence a bit incoherent. please discuss this at talkcuisine of argentina if you dont agree before making such changes again. talk ~0
12905~oppose as proposed. i agree about the redirect to mephistopheles but the majority of uses on the dab page are for mephisto so a move to mephisto disambiguation would be more appropriate.~0
12906~ commas there are too many commas in the title. doesnt need to be one before the and in this instance so ill move it. any objections and just move it back. ~0
12907~ february utclol not sure if that is a compliment or a slam but see my comments regarding anonymous editing ~0
12908~wait why were hounding on me for that? as you can see i clearly did not have the knowledge that wpbrother was around. remember wpdnb? also if you know that i had made constructive edits then why didnt you follow that? wpnoclue seems to go in my favour since i didnt know of the consequences that would come of it.~0
12909~its my perception that the number of editors is dropping in direct proportion to the number of new articles. i think wales is being far too optimistic here. i dont agree with bells request for blocks on others and i dont think he should control his article but he should be a rather knowledgeable editor of it.~0
12910~football vs. soccer i should have directed you to wikiproject national football league. sorry about that. actually this might be a good time to caution you about regional varieties of english. in general wikipedia accepts all english varieties but the varity should remain constant throughout individual articles. therefore americans sometimes have to use british spelling and viceversa to maintain continuity. anyway since your interested in american football be careful when editing pages where it might be confused with soccer. for more information seewikipediamanual of style/spelling wikipediamanual of style/national varieties of english and american and british english differences. thanks.~0
12911~i have sourced my information which you unrightly deleted my putting it back up is not edit warring also you need to look up paleoconservatism that is jefferson in a nutshell~0
12912~yes and as i just pointed out several reliable sources call loanwords konglish. what you view as common sense doesnt meet wpv and is essentially wpor. the list i was creating isnt finished and is taken from a reliable source. not random words people have pulled off the internet. if you admit that youre not looking at the sources then why are you trying to push your view of konglish into the article. ~0
12913~imagei have tagged image as because it does not provide a fair use rationale. if you believe the image to be acceptable for fair use according to wikipedia policy please provide a rationale explaining as much in accordance with the fair use rationale guideline on the image description page. please also consider using or one of the other tags listed at wikipediaimage copyright tagsfairuse. thank you. tex ~0
12914~ believe it or not im actually trying to do you a favor by engaging in a good faith discussion rather than just nominating this article for deletion. in any case if you have other genuine references ill be happy to review them. could you please provide dates and titles of the ny times articles and cite the dates and names of a few of the many many other newspapers? ideally they should be articles about antonia bennett confirming that she is a notable singer. just having her name isnt sufficient though. for example the claim of a reference at the site. when i took a look what this seems to refer to is nothing more than bennetts name appearing on a kennedy center guest list . that is not sufficient proof of notability please provide other references that she is famous. ~0
12915~historys mysteries as a source ? seriously? this article uses a trashy sensationalistic television program as if it were a legitimate source? youve got to be kidding.~0

12917~bachelor number one the song on the matrix album has a song titled summertime by bachelor number one which has the sound of sublime and sublime is mentioned numerous time. is this song officially credited to sublime etc?~0
12918~fantastic idea since family guy uses music so often as a form of humor i think its completely appropriate to have a page dedicated to said music. i dont think however that it belongs on wikiquote. so ive list of songs from family guymoved it to a wikipedia page and made the old wikiquote page a redirect page. as i have time over the next few days im going to help out adding a lot more stuff for now ive just started the article. please see the talk page of the wikipedia page ive created ive listed my ideas there for discussion.~0

12924~hi i am working on a biography of this person and the version to which you persistently revert is full of incorrect information. she is not a senior but a special advisor she never studied at mgimo but at moscow state university etc etc. look up the links before you revert to the incorrect version please. i have referenced the text appropriately and provided it with correct information. i dont understand why you interfere with the correct editing. i hope it explains it.~0

12928~i havent changed my preferences at all so im not sure why that would be. how do i fix that?~0
12929~ your comment in the serbianamericans talk page i was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question i had posed a few months ago and i saw your comment there. i thought it was interesting.ive never before seen someone else write about an american ethnicity the same way i have thought about it. i know that the southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as american but i think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially white americans and not just those in the southeast. the americans outside of the south that descended from pre c. immigrants from the uk ireland and germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a white ethnic group not just racially but ethnically as well.the only cultural differences between ethnic whites of the north where c. immigrants mostly settled and those of the south is that the south still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. where for the more recent ethnic whites this is not the case e.g. in the north. so the distinctive cultural aspects of the south have not been adopted by the ethnic whites of the north even with several centuries having passed. i do not want to make false generalizations however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. the areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. the citycentred ethnic groups in the us have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language for the most part. a few wellknown examples would be the irish and italianamericans of the northeast. so long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community cultural traditions endure. what i am getting at is that so long as a ukrainianamerican stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. s/he wont have to abandon the culture of his/her community. if s/he were to move to an area in the southeast then it would be a completely different story. id like to give you a further illustration the poles of chicago. most arrived somewhere between the s and s or so. many have had families there for well over a century. there has been very limited migration out of chicagoland for this period and the polish community there has remained extremely strong. so there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later breakdown as they go their own ways. ive written all of this to demonstrate how the ethnic americans and people who ethnically not racially but ethnically identify as white are distinct ethnically from the more recent post european ethnic communities in the major cities. i find it all very interesting. the only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an ameican/us citizen and an ethnic american and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being unamerican. these people that do not make the distinction show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. this is of course on an individualbyindividual basis and i would not generalize this in any way to any region or subregion.ive seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. ive seen it demonstrated by southerners new yorkers and even jews in south florida. by the way most of the time my ethnicity and that of family/friends would have been indeterminable by those people. im saying this because i dont want to suggest that any particular regional group of americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. ive spent a lot of time in south florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that i have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than years ago. its all unfortunate and these types of racist discriminatory and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. the good part about our differences is that ethnic americans and newer americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. this is not the case in say many areas of the former yugoslavia or in the areas where exyugoslavs have settled throughout the western world.sorry for the lack of brevity. your comment was interesting and i wanted to expand on it. also i want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the us or the us as a whole. usually when i do~0
12930~please refrain from making inconstructive edits to wikipedia.~0
12931~hmm.. sorry i just snapped since i have faced too many of those things i think we need to start a bot to convert all censored words to their uncenrosed counterparts. ~0
12932~i would have to get a lot of people in on it first to pull it off but i can start it off with at least people as is. i think wikipedias popularity might help to end the hacking/disconning for ever.~0
12933~i dont think you people get it metalcore is a genre that incorporates mixes of extreme metal music and hardcore punk music whereas deathcore is a mixture of metalcore and death metal music. they play under the genre metalcore as they use these blends such as screamed and clean vocals added in with a sound that is a fusion of hardcore punk and metal. i dont know where the genre melodic hardcore came in on this page but its wrong i dont care if a website says its that it isnt true~0
12934~the fact that is has different names in various countries makes it all the more imperative that we use the original name karin. this is the central name known to most that ties together the other renames. ~0

12938~ humor? something needs to be done with this article... hi cstar of course you are a great humorist but something needs to be done in this situation. those guys zarniwoot and fczenz are plain stupid. it seems they still do not understand that this was only a demonstration of force. they do not understand that for example we can spread the attack to much more articles. fighting with us zarniwoot and fczenz break wp policy all the time and possibly cause more damage here than we. recently sczenz blocked an ipaddress of an independent person. crazy guy how many other innocent people have he blocked already? i left him a message about that and a notice that the article introduction to quantum mechanics was already attacked two times without reversion and was already edited by three people. that was the article that was defended already instead of recognition that he is unable to defend even several articles here he just removed my post from the page so that other people could not see how stupid he is. that happened already several times. for what reason do we need such a crazy administrators here? they hurt wp more than help how can be they so stupid? do not they realize yet that wp works because most people want to make the world better not because admins fight here with bad guys?~0
12939~i have moved the article you created ffpeepo to fédérationdelafonctionpubliqueeuropéenneoftheeuropeanpatentoffice as this is the complete name. feel free to edit and remembers others might change it too. if you need any help let me know...~0
12940~this is one pov granted although its stuck in . our page host is a notable chiropractic skeptic and physical therapist who then proceeds to give a unsourced anecdotal account of chiropractic based on insider knowledge. chirobase has nothing on it that isnt already published in the peerreviewed literature ernst in particular. is there a citation to support your claim that only pts dos mds do manipulation whereas chiropractors perform adjustments? the intent business is antiquated it does not reflect the contemporary sources. lastly the subluxation bit is way overblown its used interchangeably with joint dysfunction.~0

12952~looking for test cases this is a good candidate for starting to add automated tests to the bots codebase. you can help by commenting here or on the phabricator task with examples of citations with strange formatting and edge casesspaces in strange places multiline parameters or values and similar. the idea here is to have a better way to make sure that the bot continues to parse template parameters and values correctly even when changes are made to the code. your help is appreciated.~0

12966~institute of noetic sciences i see you reverted my adjustment to the stephen barrett criticism of the institute of noetic sciences. i believe you acted in good faith. i also believe the revert was erroneous.barretts list is published information. counting the number of organizations on the list does not represent original research. it is simply a way of summarizing the context in which barretts criticism occurred. it is information that is directly and explicitly supported by the source. it is a routine calculation that most people over the age of six could perform for themselves.as the article stands now it is misleading and unbalanced. a casual reader gets the impression that barrett targeted the ions out for special and specific criticism when in fact his criticism was spread over hundreds of organizations.please undo your revert and/or reply on my talkpage explaining how my changes could be or.best regards~0

12971~here is a summary of a few notes found in the archive...guerreros reign with the victory cena earns a world championship opportunity against the titleholder of his choice at wrestlemania xxiv on sunday march in orlando florida... but which champion will he choose to face? will he go after the wwe championship – currently held by randy orton – and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it? or will cena look to conquer a different mountain and challenge an old foe world heavyweight champion edge or a new kingpin ecw champion chavo guerrero for a title he has never worn?kanes reign then there’s the state of the ecw championship held by kane who was also drafted over to raw on monday. although ecw gained the services of united states champion matt hardy the land of the extreme is now left with no world champion of their own and only a oneinthree chance to win it back at night of champions... on sunday the big red machine will defend the title in a triple threat match against big show and mark henry. while the worlds largest athlete remains on smackdown the worlds strongest man was pulled to ecw in wednesdays supplemental draft and is that brands chance to bring the title back to the land of the extreme. but if triple h edge and big show have an extremely good night of champions smackdown general manager vickie guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three world championships with both raw and ecw left out in the cold.morrisons reign fast forward to these accolades are only fitting of a true champion and i have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim. i am a world champion. i am the new face of ecw. i am the ecw world heavyweight champion.henrys reign fast forward to there is a lot of talent in the ecw locker room but i am a twelveyear veteran. this is my first world heavyweight title and ill tell you one thing its going take a more powerful man than i am to take this title out of my hands.hardys reign the greatest achievement however came in when matt triumphed in a championship scramble match to capture the ecw title his first taste of world championship gold.hardys reign continued after the contest was unscrambled and the winner was clear matt hardy stood victorious as the new ecw champion in the opening scramble match at unforgiven... after a passiondriven careerlong hunt to possess a world title the deliverer of the twist of fate has found himself atop the mountain in the land of the extreme.christians reign christian’s first world title comes after a journey that expands well beyond his two months in the land of the extreme. christians reign continued fast forward to this is the first of three worlds championship matches here at summerslam as captain charisma electrifies the staples center here at summerslam.christians reign continued fast forward to josh to illustrate the global impact of this contest if william regal wins the ecw championship hell become the ninth nonus born superstar to capture a world title in the last years. the wwe has certainly gone global and who better to wear the crown than william regalonce again wwe recognized the ecw title to be a world heavyweight championship throughout its existence until the discontinuation of the brand which resulted in all references pertaining to ecw being removed from wwe programming soon thereafter. however as noted above this is called retconing and it is something wikipedia policy prohibits in this scenario for the purpose of historical ~0

13016~binksternets paranoid and frightening theory propounded about geraldine edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. he has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general which is pure conjecture and supposition. whats more its not his place within the rules of wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. his hypothesis that a rouge ip editor from san diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of geraldine edwards to the level of bebe buell slander mary ambrose and attach geraldine edwards to the creation of almost famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.other wikipedia editors who have tried to defend geraldine flemmingmueller against binksternets attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. his interest in geraldine flemmingmueller is unhealthy and alarming and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether as he fails to maintain a neutral stance which is one of wikipedias precepts on the subject of her. that being said geraldine edwards is not a hoax shes simply a woman whos living the life she sees fit and is not interested in being included in wikipedia articles. and finally posting any inappropriate hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by binkstenets many malignant comments posted on wikipedias pages regarding geraldine edwards one of the main guiding principles of wikipedia. its time for him to stand down.the san diego college angle is still quite active with regard to geraldine edwards see usertalkzabadugeraldineedwardsisnotahoax which was started by the ip ... registered to san diego state university. this writer said approximately a couple of years ago when mary ambrose was visiting san francisco she met binksternet and they became friendly a statement that is complete bunk. nothing in the ips post is supported by reliable sources.all of this effort to defame ambrose and build up edwards is astonishingly trivial. it is a waste of my time a waste of marks time and a drag on wikipedia to have to deal with it. as long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations they must stay out of the encyclopedia. editors who repeatedly disrupt wikipedia are usually blocked. binksternet talk whatever. binksternet gives new credence to the phrase legend in his own mind. although i respect many wikipedia editors for their diligent accurate and commendable contributions binksternet is not numbered among them. in no way will i and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. his deny deny deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. unfortunately this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. this matter is settled and over and done with and this is the last time i will edit on this subject on these pages. thank you to mark arsten for acting in a competent intelligent and unbiased manner here and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. thank you. — preceding unsigned comment added by ... talk just so you know i am nowhere near san diego havent been to the college ever and am not using an alias. you quote a retired wiki editor who can no longer speak for himself yet made edits to your article based on your inability to show credibility. fuck off. ~0

13039~hi hanna simpson. thank you for the message. i tried to clean up the references you added. just for reference theres nothing wrong with citing nonenglish sources as long as they satisfy wprs but if you do then its sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per wprsue. this can be added to the citation template using the parameter see templatecite webquote. translations do not have to be professional quality they just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. regarding coi you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at user talkmaterialscientistottoneum. that doesnt mean you can never edit the article but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered ok for you to make. coi editing is not expressly prohibited but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. it might be a good idea for you to take a look at wppscoi to see what these kinds of edits are. of course what you know about the museum is true but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. the information on the museums official website is considered to be a primary source so its usage is rather limited. wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it rather articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something. so any sources you can find which discuss the museum and are independent of it would be helpful.~0

13096~ april utcill clear this up about my intentions i have been told or glanced over in passing several materials purporting the caribbean slave contribution to the population of charleston and savannah among new orleans and other multiracially populated areas. it is also rather obvious about the romantic pocahontas connection to ideas of roanoke survivors in discussions of virginia. these things are dismissed as fancy but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the melungeon community has had as an inception. so you see i am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but i do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the melungeon identity. one need not endorse a belief of association but merely allow others to see what sort of identities melungeon life has acquired. i am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in appalachia. appalachian culture is from the deep south to maritime canada. melungeon culture is centred on the gulf coast and south of bermuda on the eastern seaboardoriginally spanish areas. people think that just because impoverished scotchirish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs that they were some noble savages though they were not cherokee but in fact andrew jacksons henchmen. so many ideas here wreak of crank person nonsense. are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the antebellum south by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims? are you sitting in a trailor right now trying to deny your jerry springer lifestyle? civil wars reconstruction is a real bitch?that white spanish territory is the melungeon core in true history.see herehispanics contributed melungeon heritage via louisiana and florida colonies. this was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves. melungeons were basically the first hispanics in the united states whom often lived in secret or adapted to anglo ways. please do not spread fantasies as facts in this article this work as it is makes me laugh my ass off at the premise of what its trying to do ~0

13100~subsequent reports from several human rights organisations and political opponents have claimed that modi and his ministers instructed gujarats police officers not to obstruct the attacking mobs. not a single charge has been filed personally against modi or any of his ministers in any court.political opponents also claimed that manmohan singh is a shikhandi and also claim that the us government was having hypocritical double standards because it did not do anything against pakistani terrorist camps even when it had all the satellite footage of such terrorists and terrorist camps operating on pakistani soil so much for the war on terror as long as your selfinterests are not affecteddeleted.it is largely believed that the gujarat riot pogram was funded by the saffron dollars provided by the aahoa. majority of the members of aahoa are from narendra modis home state of gujarat and are believed to be active members of the hardliner organizations like rss and vhp.it is largely believed by christians jews and muslims that theirs is the only way and the only god. obviously two or more are wrong thats the cause of many wars and murders on earth. such ridiculous beliefs which hindu yogis laugh at.so deleted such dangerous large beliefs.~0

13107~i dont think definition creep is an acceptable reason to merge grilling and bbq. the fact that individuals use the term incorrectly and grilling is not bbq so using them interchangeably is incorrect is not a reason to use it incorrectly in this article. i believe the confusion comes from bbq grills which have the capability to both grill and bbq. that does not make the processes the same it just means that individuals have integrated the two terms for ease of use.~0

13114~ ==tbma own original research first tbma only a few days after calling this whole article a hoax has fund a new sources to breakdown this article to crap.first he claims the soviet had preplanned its withdraw from the front but finnish sources who is supported by pow interview intellegnce data and otho manninen extended archives research in soviet/russian archives have pinpointed exactlly witch soviet units where pressent in the battle and when they left.what we now for certaint is the composistion of the soviet major combat formations where pressent they soviet was reinforced by tanks and spg before the battle and during the battle soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle. this contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only soviet red army men.what about tbma sources?the sources of men from punaiset panssarit punaarmeijan panssarijoukot is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank and just uses a few phrases on the taliihantala battle.on the withdraw is issue i cant find the first sourceunder ed. zolotarev v.a. . russkij arkhiv velikaya otechestvennaya. stavka vgk dokumenty i materialy . russian archive. the great patritic war. stavka. documents and materials . moscow terra. p. . isbn . the second ^ vasilevsky aleksandr . delo moyei zhizni the point of my life. moscow politizdat. p. does in no way support tbma case and i wonder why its even there? the third^ n.i. baryshnikov . fenomen falshi pobeda v protivostoyanii. finskaya istoriografiya o zavershayushchikh boyakh leta g. s sovetskimi voyskami the fenomen of lies the victory in the confrontation. finnish historiography about final battles of summer is so vauge in deatails that it contradicts with deatailed sources like manninens on the event but gives no fact like witch units was withdraw? when where they withdrawn? the value of this text is very poor and if it should be in the text it should be moved down to section like russian neo facist view of the battle ~0

13119~ dispute i noticed theres an edit war going on with regard to the debunkingprimaltherapy link and the link at the end of the primal therapy section.my opinion is as follows. i think the link at the end of the primal therapy section should lead to the primal therapy article not to the criticism section specifically. i feel that way because the section in the page entitled primal therapy is relevant to the entire primal therapy article including the criticisms and not to the criticisms alone.it would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph see primal therapy including the criticism section.... i wouldnt be opposed to that. personally i dont believe that the section primal therapy should be on the biography page at all we should have a link only arthur janov is the creator of linked primal therapy and author of many books on that subject. imo there is no need to discuss primal therapy or its criticisms in any detail on a biography page because those things are not biographical details. they are not relevant here. they belong in the primal therapy article and there is no need to repeat that article here.with regard to the link. i dont believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about primal therapy one way or the other since this article is not about primal therapy. i dont believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of arthur janov. if we do have any such links like the link then we must revisit the whole debate here and we must include other links otherwise we violate npov by representing only one side. it would be better just not to have such links.bear in mind that art janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure. his biography should be only a few paragraphs. its not really the best place for an extensive argument.i realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki but i really dont think thats a major concern. anyone who follows a primal therapy link and reads the article will realize that primal therapy has been criticized. the readers arent dense and dont need things repeated. in other words i dont think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link and nothing more on the biography page.we should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article. if we cant achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion. ~0

13136~ unblock hello mike. after thinking very long and carefully i have taken the for me unusual step of unblocking a user you blocked without consulting you first. you blocked helvitica bold indefinitely giving the reason as vandalismonly account. i have looked at a sample of of the users edits excluding their user page and did not find a single one that i could conceive of anyone calling vandalism. even if there were vandalism edits somewhere among them that i missed this cannot possibly be described as a vandalismonly account. the user page contained some silly editing and it might be debatable whether to call it use of wikipedia for inappropriate humour or vandalism but at the most it might have justified a warning. an indefinite block on a user with a significant history of positive contributions because of a silly user page seems dubious and for such a block to be imposed without any warnings is surely unacceptable. if i have missed something which puts the block in a different light than that in which i have seen it then please let me know. ~0

13149~up martinez decided to law low from the city for a while but eventually came back to mess with vic’s woman louise. since the failed deal the vance brothers were forced to do business with the mendez brothers. this was around the time the vances built their own organization in power taking over businesses from rival gangs. victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met phil collins and his manager. at first it was believed that the mendez cartel wanted to establish a business relationship but their real plan was to have the vances give their businesses to the mendez’s and leave vice city or the vance brothers and louise would die. when they refused the cartel kidnapped them and took them near the escobar international airport. the brothers blew the death row and stopped mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. their plans were foiled. they kidnapped louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. not long before the vances storm into their mansion in prawn island. lance was held hostage while victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed armando mendez. louise was left on the floor dying next to lance. a vengeful victor formed an alliance with ricardo diaz a crime lord to bring down the mendez’s operations once and for all. victor invaded into the military base stole their army helicopter and returned it to diaz’s mansion in starfish island. once back in the chopper victor said he would owe ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. after that he flew to the mendez penthouse and killed all the mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. jerry martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill victor. finally at the rooftop in the final confrontation jerry martinez cornered vic believing he was too easy to trick. diego mendez came and the final shootout between the men led to the deaths of diego and finally jerry. lance came into the scene and but it was already over. the vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. vice city became the major spot for the drugs trade it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested including the mafia. liberty city’s mafialinked forelli family sent tommy vercetti who was recently released from prison after a year stay down “south” to get started with their expansion with vercetti as a forelli representative just to keep him out of liberty city. upon arrival to vice tommy and other men later learned to be harry and lee met ken rosenberg a bent lawyer with forelli connections at the airport. they soon met with the vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. however masked men killed everyone but tommy ken and lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. tommy informed sonny forelli about the incident. an angered forelli demanded that tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. sonny called periodically to check up on vercetti. a man for information was kent paul who gave info about a chef. tommy killed leo teal who failed to squeal about the ambush. with nowhere to go colonel juan garcia cortez who also set up the deal was his way in to find the money. he was at his most expensive yacht. cortez had a feeling that his righthand man gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed and met lance vance. vercetti met avery carrington a southern gent who was into prime real estate. tommy met ricardo diaz now a powerful coke baron. after watching a deal diaz offered vercetti work since he liked his style. soon after working for him lance and tom discovered that ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before tommy came to the rescue. before they could their revenge tommy escorted colonel cortez out of the city after a corrupt french government was after cortez for assigning tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. the men finally stormed in the diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. diaz trusted and was going to have him made but he was made by the men. tommy took over all his local businesses. the forellis sent vercetti some support later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with cuban now in feud with a haitian gang and biker gangs including love fist. he owned a protection racket several assets including the malibu a pole position strip club a porn studio kaufman cabs company a car dealership shop a boatyard down the docks and a printing company and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. through those progresses he performed robbery on a bank produced porn films~0

13160~it definitely is an interesting addition to the article. the only question is whether you can really justify fair use in this case. on the other hand im not sure if you can really assert copyright over plain text. pnass copyright policy on submissions suggests that unlike many other journals pnas doesnt demand that you sign over copyright. the question then is whether the copyright belongs to fte or to nick matzke. i would suggest sending nick and email and seeing if he will release the figure under a suitable copyleft license. i clearly see it as a valuable addition to the article one that helps the readers appreciation of the topic.~0

13181~microbrewerywhen the first sentence says creemore springs was a microbrewery located in... it instantly suggests that the brewery no longer exists. while i understand that the author is trying to imply that creemore would no longer be considered a microbrewery due to their ownership structure and level of production i dont think this is the best wording. as a result i have changed the first sentence to creemore springs is a brewery.... ~0
13182~an article about lincoln which does not mention speed is just pure censorship. speed was his closest most intimate friend as they both state many times in their letters. the sole possible reason for excising speed is censorship of this part of his life. that isnt acceptable. no historian of lincoln would find that acceptable. in fact there is no history of lincoln whatsoever which excises speed. if you can find one post it. the sources are clear that he was his most intimate friend.~0

13196~when i said yobmod came he saw he fucked up this article this was because i was extremely pissed off at yobmods constant deletion of links to actual themes used in science fiction and giving rules for the page which makes finding themes that can be used on the article more harder then a pet owners decision to put down their beloved animal we had to use themes that were used in science fiction they couldnt be used in any other genre they had to appear in more then one franchise and we couldnt use several dozen tv shows as citations. although what you did to the home and away character articles youd probably agree with him. its obvious that user who found a citation to willow being produced by imagine entertainment is a sockpuppet of gabrielkat and his/her edit to my discussion page really annoyed me. anyhoo yes i do agree to behave in a more civilised manner like i was before but even civilised people react so uncivilised if they are constantly annoyed by someone. ~0

13218~i left this messagebefore anyone bans this account for sock perhaps it might be smart on your part to go and look why i was banned in the first place for a troll only account which had been active and had taken part in making several articles more accurate the reason i was banned is because a certain admin took a disliking to me and used trolling as an excuse he also defaced my pages and provked me he got no reaction from me and banned me anyway. go check it up for yourself but banning me will only annoy me and i wouldnt recomend that.oh just to add since being banned ive recieved hundreds of spam emails in yiddish or something i had game companies contact me because ive been reported for spreading their games on torrent sites in fact ive had a whole bunch of stuff that points directly to the admin that banned me only he could have had access to the email address used for this if i keep recieving this harrasment i will be fighting back i want only to have a user account on wiki i want to add to articles but im being refused and banned again and again when i never actually did anything wrong so i leave it with you who is reading this you can leave me alone and i can edit wiki like everyone else or you can open pandoras box its entirely up to you im a man of peace myself and i hope you see sense.and you banned me anyways well dont say i didnt warn you i was reasonable from the start but obviously that isnt what you guys wanted let the box be opened.~0

13221~that is one possibility. if we want to use the existing templateguideline the issue comes down to knowing exactly how many people are required to say that many editors agree with it. the templateguideline does not say that the guideline was approved by the cabal so we can use any process we want to get the many editors to formally agree with it if we want the templateguideline sticker. personally i dont like that template nor do i think that carbonite would ever commit to a specific number of people as being many editors. for that reason i agree that we should create our own template that does not require many editors and probably has better looking graphics but i dont see why we would have to get the new template approved by anyone except those affected by it. ~0

13225~the article is poorly written. it has nothing to do with a readers iq. it has to do with the ability of the writer to convey the information in the simplest terms. ergo it is the writer who is lacking in talent/iq and not the reader. you can compare two math books and you will see most people cant understand higher math because the guy writing it cant understand how to convey information in simplest terms. the goal is understanding and not obfuscation or worse to show how smart the writer must be. if the writer cant clearly explain what cloud computing is in words or less the writer shouldnt be writing about it.~0

13254~im asking for a citation to the change you made to the consensus version of the article. it should be backed by wprs. if you felt a previous claim was not properly backed it would be best to ask for a cite by so tagging it rather than introducing conflicting uncited evidence. edit conflict. that is i agree with kguirnela.~0

13257~los angeles helicoptersa tag has been placed on los angeles helicopters requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company product group service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. please read the general criteria for speedy deletion particularly item as well as the guidelines on spam. if you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising you may contest the tagging. to do this please add on the top of the article and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. talk~0

13260~deletion from the ritual sectioni have deleted the followingthis head cut is not supposed to go all the way through the samurais neck honor dictated that the cut shall finish just before completely beheading the samurai that has committed the seppuku. complete decapitation was considered a grave dishonor and disgrace.reason there is nothing to substantiate this at all. the only thing i have come across that suggests that leaving a piece of skin was at once considered ideal is from the hagakure and even there it was not a matter of disgrace. in fact in the hagakure yamamoto tsunetomo advocates cutting all the way through better to do the job properly than risking botching the job in the practice of past times there were instances when the head flew off. it was said that it was best to cut leaving a little skin remaining so that it doesnt fly off in the direction of the verifying officials. however at present it is best to cut clean through. of course the notion that a lb head should go flying off presumeably from the blood pressure is absurd. this was likely just an urban legend back in the day in japan.~0

13262~in some parts of canada the situation is legislatively divided into warring u.s. and british camps . for instance in british columbia and alberta doctors of podiatric medicine d.p.m. still exist. in manitoba saskatchewan prince edward island nova scotia newfoundland new brunswick yukonand n.w.t standards are slightly higher and are based on quackerybased charlatan british chiropodists who insist on calling themselves podiatrists. in manitoba for example about or so quack chiropodists insist on titling themselves dr. despite having bogus year qualifications. this disgusting manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between british chiropodists and usa dpms. in the province of ontario major differences in scope of practice exist. consequently there is still a title distinction between uk chiropodists and usa dpm podiatrists ie. american doctors of podiatric medicine. unfortunately both share a governing body the college of chiropodists of ontario. to accelerate ontarians into confusing u.s. trained podiatrists with bogus uk podiatrists the british chiropodists who are in greater number heavily lobby the provincial government regularly into perpetuating maintaining the banned prefix dr. and the associated title podiatrist. unbelievably and quite maliciously british chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all usa dpms who migrate after into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. this is plainly maliciously designed so that the ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications. the apma acfas is now studying this injustice and blatant discrimination~0

13300~thank you ｡◕‿◕｡ for taking the time to review my case. my disruptive behavior on the tesla article was out of pure frustration because no consensus was reached for my proposed edits. i hope that you grant me clemency and if necessary ban me from editing the nikola tesla article. i have said what i wanted to say on the nikola tesla talk page. it was the one article i felt the most passionate about. once again i am very sorry for my behavior. i have learnt my lesson. i would like to show that i can be a constructive editor of wikipedia in the cambridge ~0
13301~if you like ill take it to arbcom or the like. opposing the inclusion of an image that accurately depicts something described in the text is nonsense it actually refers specifically to a flag that uses pantone colors that match to those used in the image in question im not talking about where the text generically refers to flag of italy. its of course even more nonsensical when no relevant justification is givenbut i digress. if you dont like or dont care ill just reinclude the image forthwith as such action would be well within the bounds of consensus wikipedia policy and the purpose of wikipedia in general. ¦ ~0

13303~blocking = censorship after repeated attempts to correct the error and giving strong and valid reasons for doing so the author of the webpage continues to revert the edit claiming encyclopedia britannica is correct apologies but that is a very weak source and fails to address the strong and valid point i made for the edit by blocking my attempts to make the correction you are denying the reader from this insight and hence you might as well let anyone be the sole source for information here with the veto power to block any corrections original authors tend to not like being corrected you can argue why you disagree with my corrections but quoting eb is not valid it is ignorant i am both a historian and mathematician who has extensive background on cantor and his russian heritage was the most pivotal cause for his rejection from the german mathematical community and subsequent overly harsh criticism that led to his mental health issues this is pivotal information to claim he was german is false and totally covers over this fact kronecker was not as much opposed to his work as he was to the fact that a russian discovered it period who is in an edit war i am in a truth mission if wikipedia wants to peddle eb then just calls yourself wikibrittanica end of story~0

13322~ i have emailed you with a precise answer to your question. but for other wikipedians i hereby publicly certify that to the best of my knowledge i have not been the sock puppet of myronwyn loren dillman thescienceguy lars koenig or mirondella. in my future writings on the lamé equation and uniformization i hope that i might become the sock puppet of felix klein. my personal connection with the evans affair is the same as yours but perhaps less so there is nothing underhanded in adding references to mathscinet and uncc documents that evans himself made publicly available. both these references speak volumes. i am very glad that evans wikipedia page has been reduced to a stub. in its present form however the statements presented there cannot be verified by a wikipedia reader. some link to the historical notes on the aias website seems necessary to make these statements verifiable. i cannot understand why there are wikipedia pages on scientific cranks. however if these pages exist the crankery should be made immediately apparent. i think my additions to this page have been the mathscinet references which exposed the crankery pointing out that the university of glamorgan is a former polytechnic with no prowess in pure science that evans got himself fired from uncc and his invention of the idiotic term cartan geometry. ~0

13331~ substances vs. expressions i reverted the change made by boredzo reinserting the passange it is often errouneously thought that.. in fact the word erroneously was not part of the original edit removing it substantially changed the meaning of the paragraph and made it inconsistent. the point is that mass nouns cannot be defined in terms of what they refer to but must rather be defined with reference to their grammatical properties such as cooccurrence restrictions. ~0

13335~i second this barnstar. i appreciate the amount of work you put into that debate. i applaud your efforts to keep the article from straying too far outside the linguistic mainstream. i had a similar problem with a disambiguation page koko which i was finally able to resolve by changing it to say that koko was trained in sign language which everyone agrees on instead of having it say she uses sign language which as you know is a matter that is strongly contested by linguists. it was particularly frustrating because the article on the gorilla had the information about the controversy but for some reason my edits to the disambiguation page kept being reverted as if there was no question about the issue.~0

13337~what is to be agreed ref cited as effects of temazepam but is about other drugs and doesnt mention temazepam. title of the ref changed in the article but pointing to something else? there is no discussion going on since weeks they just dont respond but wait some time and then revert w.o. discussion? they are stonewalling me. instead of discussions they come with silliness like conflict of interest. this is vandalism on their side. they have accused me of vandalism now enough so i may use this word myself. this is a scandal. where can i complain?...~0
13338~some ideas from me. i will be potentialy out of internet contact in a few weeks so may not be much help.have it as another tab on the tabs already on ga pagesspecifically go out to recruit people either dropping personal notes at talk pages wikiprojects and the signpost maybe even a watchlist header if you can swing itadvertise it as purely to get inexperienced editors reviewing. make it clear that there will be help right the way through the process and they cant really make too much of a mess.see if you can get some regulars who are willing to have their articles reviewed by these new reviewers. that should help alleviate any biting issues. the bonus for the regulars is that they will get there articles reviewed faster.i would not treat this as a way to clear the backlog but to get those reviewers who have considered reviewing but were a little unsure whether they could. this has the added bonus of increaing reviewer numbers and so reducing the backlog and making sure the new reviewers devlelop good habits from the start.end of ramble.  talk ~0

13341~ now that you have raised the issue i think we need another article for the fall section of the byzantine empire. the decline of the byzantine empire article is a mere chronological list of events that bled the empire to death and not specifically associated with the actual fall between the th and th centuries. i am open to any suggestions as to what it could be named how about byzantium under the palaiologoi? if thats accepted then byzantium under the komnenoi sounds reasonable and within a similar convention. then we could have byzantium under the heraclean byzantium under the isaurian byzantium under the macedonian and so forth. ~0

13365~marienlyst castlehi thank you for stopping by. it was a red link on a page i had created and when i read about it i realized that it had an interesting life and was under appreciated. i have a soft spot for under appreciated thing that are interesting so wanted to improve the article. ive done what i could with my awful danish to english skills and was in need of help. i think the page is % done and just needs a wee bit more love. if youd like to help i could set up a sandbox for it so we can work on improving the article. when thats done wed need to get some sources as it only has one right now. then wed need to get the information into english. once its in english i can do most of the editing. id also like to find someone whod be able to get some photos. maybe since its a museum theyd probably even help if we emailed them. so what do you say are you in ? ~0
13366~heh yeah i meant do not. i did say aggressive and i also lamented i could not reduce it further. the reason i did not take it further is because not fragmenting discussion takes precedence over file limitations. if there is even a possibility a thread is ongoing as there was for everything i left since it was posted in the last few days you leave it. as to reinstating some of it i will reinstate everything not out of spite... but because to not do so means more work for everyone actually involved in the discussion. boy~0

13376~merged with pentateuchi merged this article with pentateuch there was nothing in the pentateuch article that was not already in the torah article so there wasnt much point in making the distinction. if the article were to be recreated i would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the torah. podous dates and wellhausen i think this edit by should be pulled at least pending further considerationit must be noted that wellhausens knowledge of jewish literature outside of the bible was limited and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. notably he supposed the receiving of torah was dating from about bce and that of monarchy established by saul c. bce and the later prophets th to th centuries bce. julius wellhausen in the case of the first the date in jewish chronology is established as bce saul is dated to bce and isaiah during bce. pp. kantorthese dates are based on seder olam rabbah. but a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the temple in bce way after the accepted dates for eg the battle of marathon bc or xerxes invasion of greece bc so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of classical greece would have to be found which nobody seriously believes is credible. see missing years hebrew calendar.so people who use the seder olam rabbah dates though not eg generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the babylonian records viz. bce. adding that shift to kantors dates gives bce for the exodus bce for saul and bce for isaiah compare chronology of the bible. modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly see eg kingdom of judah. so wellhausens dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.furthermore what is important for wellhausens history is the relative dates of these events. even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events and the relative dates between them.i dont think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to wellhausen. im not sure i have ever seen wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with seder olam.you seem to be well versed so i need not explain to you how greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.what modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province but this particular subject if it is to be consistent can not be adjusted to match sources outside of its innate culture or time never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither jewish nor even monotheistic. i note that the missing years hebrew calendar completely lacks citations so its hard to say who and how argues for the modern secular dating. in any case i will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.chronology of the bible article besides being likewise poorly cited has four other templates at the top {{confusingdate=june }}{{disputeddate=june }}{{refimprovedate=june }}{{totallydisputeddate=june }}{{cleanupdate=april }} however i will get to that also eventually. this article is about the torah. textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject so id like to keep that short. my point with the dates was to illustrate that not all th century theories about the torah were well the dates need not be scholarly. they come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. id say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required however deletion of what constitutes cultural me~0

13391~for the reader unfamiliar with the situation the block was set in response to my repeated use of the phrase deletionist vandals on several afd entries according to karmafist i was being an asshole to deletionists who do indeed disagree with me by calling them vandals.now karmafist you and i both know that there are people who think it is acceptable to replace the contents of snoopy with say snoopy is a shitfaced cockmaster. i disagree with those people and im sure you do too. in fact there are lots of people who doand they refer to the aforementioned individuals as vandals. however they are never blocked for this. since according to you being an asshole to people who disagree with you is a blockable offense it follows that one of the following must be truecalling someone a vandal does not constitute being an asshole in which case i should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists who disagree with me vandals i was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me.your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false in which case i should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him. again one of the following must be truecalling someone a vandal does constitute assholery in which case one can infer from the fact that those who refer to the snoopy types as vandals have never been blocked for that that it is acceptable to engage in this specific type of assholery towards those who are indeed vandalsand as i proved on user talkaaron brenneman deletionists are indeed vandals you claimed that my proof was bullshit and that it did not need refutation but your assertion does not make it socalling someone a vandal does not constitute assholery in which case its all irrelevant since as i was not being an asshole the conditions under which being an asshole is acceptable are not an issue.calling someone a vandal only constitutes assholery if it is false in which case see the abovementioned proof as to why that is not the case here.now which of these alternatives is it? alternately you can show me a fallacy if i were you i would try and find a false dichotomyor trichotomy for that matteras my argument rests on showing you how none of the possible conclusions of your argument justify a block on me perhaps you will be able to find an alternative i have missed that does indeed justify blocking me or a mistaken premise and i will gladly concede that my behavior was wrong and was deserving of a block and will change in the future. ~0

13394~the first problem with the licensing for these images is that you say that theyre public domain pd because you created the images. as long as you did your best to make a faithful reproduction you have no copyright in these images either youve simply copied a copyrighted image and dont have any right to release it or youve copied a pd image and dont have any rights to control its usage. by the way dont think that im charging you with wrongdoing im trying to say this in the simplest way possible and you have no rights is the way that the copyright law works its not an assertion that you should get out of my way or anything like that. therefore theres no real evidence that we can use these images. are the original photos pd? while most documents and photos created in the s are copyrighted its possible that theyre pd such as if they were published without a copyright notice or if they were published with a copyright notice but their copyright was not renewed. im not an expert on these things therefore to get details you should ask a question at wikipediamedia copyright questions or commonscommons talklicensing. these pages are frequented by those much more familiar with copyright than i am so they should be able to help you. ~0

13431~ i dont get it. so if someone would be to travel through time their actions would have no effect?but time travel itself affects the past youre taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time thus for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to introducing matter/energy/whatever that didnt exist there before thus as per chaos theory possibly screwing up everything. any successful travel through time would have an effect otherwise it wouldnt be time travel.with that in mind does the principle boil down to time travel is only possible if it has no effect thus time travel the possibility of which necessitates having an effect is not possible?the matter and energy of which the time traveller and his clothing etc consists would if the universe is a closed system have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a reallocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesnt seem to be a viable alternative either. but if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didnt exist nor of that which already existed but was in use already what does he consist of?even if the universe is not a temporally closed system i.e. matter/energy can vanish and reappear at future points in time for something to vanish in the present and reappear in the past it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it cant exist twice at the same point in time i.e. if atom a was sent back in time from a point z to a point x it would vanish at point z now and appear at point x back then as a but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point y somewhere before point z where it was originally introduced as a otherwise a and a which should be identical would exist at the same point in time which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.im assuming the principle isnt based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that matters is the action/inaction of humans as in the interpretation of schroedingers experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it which implies the humans perception determines the state of reality. if that is true then the example from twilight zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur unless it actually changed the events i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesnt allow for any changes of the past.im aware this post is getting a bit ranty but im seriously at a loss here. how does time travel not change the past regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? the very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time thus changing the past.the only possibility i can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred i.e. the future representation person a of someone person a appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person a to travel back in time that already caused person a to go back in time i.e. both of their time lines are identical but in which there is no other time line in which the time traveller didnt already appear before travelling back in time i.e. there is no time line in which person a travels back in time without person a having travelled in time already i.e. where person a doesnt eventually become person a the time traveller.all of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. — talk · contribs ~0

13434~well at least you acknowlege your breach of policy. my comments are observations not personal attacks. aside from that email of course which falls outside of wikipedias jurisdiction. i sincerely feel youre not up to being an admin on wikipedia. i dont even feel youd make a good editor on articles. from the limited experience ive had with how you do your little job here i feel youre unintelligent and that youre impulsive. those are my opinions. my observations. if you take them to heart thats you. i take it youre an actual human being and not a bot as such i presume you understand that there are definitions of unfair outside of the wikipedia rulebook. other admins did comment on your frivilous use of the block she could have too. instead she chose to ignore your breach of policy and comment on me. anyway this is about you and not her so thats all ill say of that. cheers.~0
13435~im sure the x and nt/ stack was not rewritten maybe only partially contrary to what said the former employer but i admit i have no valid external documentation link to point for this was my personal experience with wireshark and protocol packets confirmed in bsd article. most of the rewriting happened between xp and vista so nt. anyway post xp sometimes still show an old arp bug. about command line tools why you remove the sentence and not modified accordingly? anyway i understood your point about bsd vs freebsd~0

13438~ a barnstar for you the technical barnstar thank you very much for  vesey joseph kaipayil per your decline at wprpp which reassured me that i havent gotten too easy at afc would you mind unsalting the page so it can be moved? i dont know who originally salted it since the page history is only for the latest version. all the best talk  chat  thanks talk do a snotbot run i was wondering if snotbot great name task could be run on this and this. sure can do.  babble  running now. once you see the bot activity stop feel free to mark those categories as done.  yak  thank you working on a new tool if youre interested you can see an early version here. it allows you to perform arbitrary searches through the recent changes database. so it helps with looking for particular types of edits that were recently made. might be useful for vandal fighters. i still have some work to do on it but its working. let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. ill announce it more widely once its more complete.  spill the beans  blocked scottywong ive blocked you for hours. i appreciate you probably feel provoked but this does not justify your comments. now thats a unique outcome. dont get me wrong i dont disagree that what i said is a blockable offense i just wonder why when a different editor says the exact same phrase and someone complains the complainant gets told to shut the fuck up and do something useful and stop trying to be the civility police. was i using the phrase in a different context? im not looking for an unblock im just looking for a formal acknowledgement that there is a double standard. for more info see wikipediaanimalleusfatuorumandcornellier this ani thread and this an thread. id appreciate a response.  verbalize  id imagine because its a different admin who handled that dispute. id agree theres a total double standard here all i can g~0

13441~instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. the church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the bible and never questioned it. when some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the bible then the church simply said hay look the bible says this and if you reject what the bible says then you cannot be a christian. there were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. why didnt the church have a set cannon until about the ads because there were no fake writings until the gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real bible verse the gnostic ones. why did the church have to speak about the deity of jesus because the gnostic cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said john said jesus was god believe it or get out. the same thing is happening today. why is there so much talk about homosexuality in the church today simple there was no need to speak of it until the homosexual community started to twist the bible and now the church is forced to say hay this is what the bible says. it happened in the regarding slavery and im sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the bible.~0
13442~the san jacinto monument is listed on obeliskth century. the question of it being an obelisk was raised in and got no replies while this question also from got one negative reply. i would say there is for now no actual consensus. however if san jacinto was ruled to not be an obelisk the next tallest could be the juche tower in pyongyang north korea which is about ft taller than the washington monument. it has four sides but then again you could argue the top is still too ornate for it to be an obelisk.~0

13445~ you should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. this applies to articles about you your achievements your business your publications your website your relatives and any other possible conflict of interest. creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. if you create such an article it might be listed on articles for deletion. deletion is not certain but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. this is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. all edits to articles must conform to wikipediano original research wikipedianeutral point of view and wikipediaverifiability. if you are not notable under wikipedia guidelines creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion. if your achievements etc. are verifiable and genuinely notable and thus suitable for inclusion in wikipedia someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. see wikipediawikipedians with articles. babble ~0

13465~unintelligible to nonexperts like most maths articles on wikipedia this one is unintelligible to someone that does not already know the material.consider an intelligent programmer with a basic knowledge of maths who wants to get an ideal of what all the talk about baysian networks is about and whether they should read more. well they wont be any the wiser from this article. i have a phd in comp sci but limited knowledge of this field and i can only follow the sprinkler example with effort so dont tell me that it is intelligible.the topic is technical and we certainly do not want journalistic waffle. but an introductory example of showing how the joint probablilities for a simple two node example can be simplified would be a good start. then maybe somthing about independent nodes which is not even mentioned. etc. the goal of wikipedia is not to demonstrate how clever wikipedians are.~0

13469~peter isotalo has fixed the sentence by recasting it. it sure seems odd though to fix a perfectly good nicelywritten sentence that flows with the style and tone of the article in order to avoid a supposed controversy which is really no controversy at all but rather a grammar issue which could be clearly understood by an elementary school student who pays attention in class.~0
13470~mish mashi believe this article in its current format is a major mish mash because by a curious mix of disparate citations it seeks to cover khatris from the peshawar to nadia in bengal and deep south into peninsular india . so either the article is restructured to cover by provinces both india and pakistanor by creation of separate articles for khatris from different states . although the overwhelming majority of khatris are punjabi this article in its current state has juxtaposed citations and content from books pertaining to one region to attach to another which is really quite absurd . some interesting references to manu smriti and dasam granth also need discussing in the way these books have been used in the article . and off course the addition and deletion of some interesting citations on this and related articles by both new and experienced editors also needs exploration . ~0
13471~theyre clearly prosarkeensian. youre just camping the page to force your pov. your talk page stuff isnt even in good faith anymore.~0
13472~women getting killed in a domestic homicide is a tragedy especially for all the loved ones affected. but men get killed to. and wikipedia is supposed to be about presenting facts with an npov. phil hartman as one example had two children who no longer have their father. my efforts were toward deskewing a heavily biased article. i presented facts. i accepted criticism. i worked further toward improvement.you tell me here to take this as another formal warning. formal? you did not identify yourself as having authority over me. and in your first comment you actually thanked me. if you had someone close to you a female killed in a domestic violence incident by a man i will suggest to you that you take a step back and examine your own intentions for bias.ive examined all the criticism toward me here regarding my edits. i scoured it down to straight quotes and still it got deleted. this indicates to me that the issue will continue to remain emotionally charged and that as a result the bias will continue. for that i am sad. ~0

13502~another falsification by . the statement that we all find laughable except you has obviously been crafted by a single author and spread across every page related to jebus. absolutely rediculous that you would accuse other editors of npov. absolutely absurd of you to do that in fact a mockery of wikipedia policies. what a hypocritical statement all too common amongst your ilk.~0
13503~trust me thats a feeling most of us share but you know how things work around here. we try to be as neutral as possible for a long as possible. i do hope you all can reach a consensus regarding information on the article since it has potential to actually become featured some day. cheers.~0
13504~it was an attempt to bribe...novickas~0
13505~the place to talk about this is on the massacre talk page but i think you should read the archives to this page very carefully because the problem with the word massacre is exactly the same as with the word wpterrorist a word with intrinsically negative connotations that are generally applied to the actions ones enemies and opponents.do you think we should have a page on carnage and bloody slaughter as well as massacre? if not why not? also i would question much of what you have listed above for example the earliest source which is the area of the oed specalises in is r. lindsay hist. cron. scotl. ii. the xxiiij day of august..the grytt..murther and messecar of paris wes committit. for the noun and j. penry viewe publ. wants wales men which make no conscience for gaine sake to breake the law of the æternall and massaker soules..are dangerous subjects. for the verb and this is a dictionary issue not an encyclopaedia issue. i would go through others but lets skip strait to the categories you have suggested. for example there is a strong case for saying that many massacres are not human rights abuses because the term is attached to many events that are not or were not human rights abuses. for example there is nothing in the dictionary definition that stops any mass killing within the laws of war being described as a massacre but that is not a human rights abuse or are you going to make up a roll you own definition? ~0

13507~ logic please the primary reason to date for retaining this picture is notcensored that is a misapplication of policy if the image has no encyclopedic value therefore iar is applied to remove that reason which allows for removing the image as unencyclopedic. editing policy only applies if again the content has encyclopedic value which is exactly the point im disputing. and last i checked if this were a vote which it isnt the rfc was to in favor of removing though some of the in favor of keeping put a lot of effort into rationalizing that result away. repeating myself yet again you are not going to win this debate by quoting policy at me because i can quote policy just as well as you can possibly better. you are not going to win this debate by using insulting terminology like scraping the bottom of the barrel. i know how to deal with pointless rhetorical snark and it doesnt phase me in the least. you are either going to have to give a reason explaining why this content is valuable which would be the decent thing to do or else youre all going to have to stick to the current practice of bullying and edit warring to keep the content in. im happy to discuss the matter if you choose that route im sanguine with and capable of refuting all of your policy misconstruals and if you want to go the other path ill see if i can get some other reasonable editors to come and help me remove it unreasonably. i dont really care which way it goes you should choose whichever makes you most comfortable. ludwigs ~0

13520~welcomehello and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions.i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article. your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. to reduce the chances of your contributions being undone you might like to draft your revised article before submission and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. see our help page on userspace drafts for more details. if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. here are a few other good links for newcomersthe five pillars of wikipediahow to edit a pagehelp pagestutorialhow to write a great articlemanual of stylei hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date. if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page. again welcome~0
13521~i was not contacted by anyone thats for one. i was at meta due to the then ongoing voting regarding the closure of wikipedia in the so called siberian language. i saw the announcement about the ongoing vote and went there. i noticed two people familiar to me you and taxman. i knew of both being involved in secretive whats in my opinion damaging to wikipedia discussions taxman in carnildos promotion you in gianos block and opposed both without going into a great detail at all. no one responded to my opposing taxman but you and kylu started to comment on my oppose vote against you insisting that i explain myself. if that discussion affected others it is not my fault. i was asked for the explanation and i provided it upon request.no you say that my oppose was based on the distortions of what happened over irc. nevertheless and to this day you did not give a clear and complete answer that would provide your own version. your answer was always an evasive denial. below i asked this question again. if you finally give an account of that sad event we will finally be able to resolve that old issue. ~0

13537~fair use rationale for imagethanks for uploading or contributing to image i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. tast ~0

13545~ it is interesting how the perception of coi across different subjects. i recall a while back a serious proposal was put in place suggestion on irish people should have a voice in determining the name of the article of their state. meanwhile a very experienced editor tried to argue the scientists should not be permitted to edit animal testing because they have a coi in as much they have an interest in the subject because it keeps them in jobs. aspergers is a particularly interesting situation because some of the characteristics of the syndrome could mimic the symptoms of coi editing i.e. an abnormally intense focus on the asperger article. it could be quite a tricky situation to deal with actually. et ~0

13550~great job with those idoits that keep taking wabalios awardsgreetings i am the great pickelbarrel and i wanted to say thank you for helping to sove the problem my very good friend wabalio was having with these stupid vandals that kept taking his awards. when i first met him he was all juiced up on the mary jane and it was impossible to make heads or tails of what he was talking about. he seems to have ridden his system of this dangerous narcotic. the only problem i have is that it seems that i also cant edit his page. apparently in order to get rid of those that kept taking the awards i gave him you mistakingly made it impossible for any editor to write to him. that is good and bad. while it will certainly keep away the mariujuana dealers that he had been associating with it also prevents me from giving him little things to show him how proud we are of his drug free life style. all the studies show that these gifts can really make a huge difference in a dopeaholics life. i hope there is some way we can remedy this unfortunate error. your truely the amazing pickelbarrel~0

13555~ fred meyer reversion i was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the fred meyer article. that addition was composed of four parts. first you claimed fred g. meyer to be a member of the rosicrucian order etc. providing sources. i wont discuss the validity of the sources here but that clearly concerns fred g. meyer himself not the stores unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. next you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to hitler. as far as i can see the main connection to fred meyer was that both nazism and the stores use the colours red white and black which is a rather weak link. no source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its founders rosicrucian connections. hitlers connection to the rosicrucians was sourced again i wont discuss the quality of the sources but was unrelated to the stores. thirdly you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed uboats but this the part most relevant for the stores was still unsourced. finally the notes part could have been more fitting for the talk page but definitely does not belong into the article proper.thus your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced. by the way the version where you described your addition as your research shows another problem even if it is true original research is in principle unsuited for wikipedia. i hope that answers your question. yours ~0

13575~well that is not correct. if you are unwilling to learn the difference between inuniverse and outuniverse then i think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. the problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. this means it is an inuniverse element of the article referring exclusively to events within the series. if the episode was set on a different date to that it aired on then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint they will always exist they do not cease to exist so we do not use our date. so maybe you need to have a rethink. i would personally hope that you take this on board before undoing valid edits and attempting to discredit editors. not that it even matters but i did watch the show. the ~0

13601~ im short of time at the moment and a lot of the policy and guideline pages have had their content shuffled around but here is a recent template deletion discussion that illustrates some of the problems with sourcewatch as a reliable source. beyond issues of bias the main reason that open wikis are not allowed as reliable sources is that one can never guarantee what is going to appear on the screen at any given random time when the source page is loaded. it could be good info or it could be poop. that is the main reason that wikipedia is not allowed to source itself and the principle holds for all wikis. as to the drudge issue i think that the arguments presented on talkgeorge soros in opposition to including wellsourced criticism from bill oreilly apply here and eleemosynary was a strong opponent of including that information in the soros article. the oreilly criticism is nowhere near as harsh and derogatory as the piece i removed from drudge. oreilly is certainly more notable as is his opinion than the nypress author. i really would like to see a consistent treatment of sources in all articles and i try to apply that wherever i edit but i already have about a thousand articles on my watchlist so i cant fix everything. ~0

13616~smalleys postion on these matters is essentially the same in his most recent work he is still writing on the subject. moreover smalleys perception is also that of many other leading authorities on the gospels in the early church such as christopher rowland theologianchristopher rowland who may not unlike smalley be specialists in the johannine literature. the pespectives reperesented in the article as it is currently represent to my reading one particular strand of the redaction critical approach. broadly this approach shares with smalley/rowland a decreased tendency to regard the synoptic gospels as transmitting a historical source. but the corollary is to treat both the gospel genre and much of the charactersistic gospel content as a theological construct specifically due to the author of mark. but if mark invented the feeding in the wilderness as a theological construct then the presence of the same story in john shows dependence. but this view of mark is not by any means a consensus many scholars like smalley and rowland would maintain that there were indeed independent historical accounts of jesuss ministry and gospel message that preceded both the synpoptics and john and provided the basis for their common narrative material. this is not reflected in the article at present~0

13644~im keeping a neutral stand in the notability debate. while im generally inclined toward inclusion i see good points made by both sides in this area. i had the misunderstanding that drv would resolve the notability issue for the time being but i was mistaken. it seems clear that theres a consensus to move back to main space though. i see the core of this debate to be values inclusionism vs. deletionist censorship vs. free speech and gay liberation vs. rightwing conservatism with procedures and guidelines as a cover. ~0
13645~ discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations hii observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for japanese monarchs and royals. it seems that these weeks there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots. one example is whether to standardize thai royal persons. of course thai and japanese are totally different for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc and should probably be as separate as eastern are in relation to european royalty naming. i think japanese naming and thai naming could end up to different conventions and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that. however discussions may give new ideas and/or give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning. would you see the arguments and votes at wikipedia talkmanual of style thailandrelated articles and do you have any opinion? ~0
13646~thoughout history heroic men and women have suffered and died for the sake of freedom. today we battle fanatics overseas who wish to destroy our freedom to believe as we choose. today our governments find it easy to restrict our freedoms in order to preserve our freedoms. freedom is under attack at home and abroad. it must be defended whereever possible. celebrities should be glad to be a part of increasing the freedom of their fans. if they are not then there is an unending supply of wanttobefamous persons who will. why shouldnt standing up for freedom be something we ask from those who want us to spend millions on them?~0

13664~information needing to be inserted into the articlethe translation needs to be continued and the result wikified and styled. taken from here. moved here because markstreet reverted the article for the th time and i already reverted two times. as the transnistrian referendum deadline approaches to the support for the separatists from tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies but also campaigns in the purest kgb style. this years june month several publications from russia and transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts” a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern moldova. the study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names international council for democratic institutions and state sovereignty icdiss where mauco leads and euroatlantic joint forum contact group. among the signatures were quoted several wellknown oxford standford or harvard stefan talmon christopher goebel nancy furman paul williams stephen krasner andrew lorenz michael scharf william wookd. these were said to have participated in april at a conference at the bacon hotel in washington together with several other experts in international law among which a high ranking official of the us state department. they all concluded that “transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state” thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. the ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. astounded they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the russian press. stephen krasner professor of international relations at stanford university declared that he didn`t even wrote about transdniester ever. michael scharf professor at case western university transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of paul williams written over a decade ago not about transdniester but about nagorno karabah. stefan talmon professor an oxford university declared “i want to make it clear that i was not involved in the writing of this report. i suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report and to deceive the public”. ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the the economist. after studing the text of the report the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language certain expressions betrayed the fact that english was not the maternal language of the authors. for example the use of the expression telephone centrals instead of exchanges is a very common error found in russian to english surprises continued. the british journalists found that at the bacon hotel in washington had not taken place any such conference. none of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. about the two organizations which created the study the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. from the so called euroatlantic joint forum contact group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label informs the economist in its rd august edition in an article called propaganda wars returns. ~0

13674~numerical localization visualization of attractors because of many pictures of attracters in the article i think it would be good to add something aboutattractors visualization from computation point of view attractors can be naturally regarded as selfexciting attractors or hidden attractors. selfexciting attractors can be localized numerically by standard computational procedure in which after transient process a trajectory started from a point of unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of unstable equilibrium reaches an attractor and computes it such examples are classical attractor in van der pol beluosov–zhabotinsky lorenz and many others dynamical systems. while basin of attraction of hidden attractors does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria and therefore hidden attractor cannot be localized by standard computational procedure.~0

13678~ metacompiler hay i see you contributed to compilercompiler and to the metacompiler page adding a cwic topicit seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles its self i.e.defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the metastep that sets a metacompiler apart from other compilercompilersa common saying on forth sites. especially meta step the fact is that lisp compiles its self practically the same identical way as forth does.selfhosting compilers are common. most general purpose language compilers are selfhosted. i pointed out that many of the compilers i wrote or worked on compiled themselves. and actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. i was head of the language development group at kontron electronics. many console games were written using our compilers. all of the compilers were written in an extended pascal. which bootstrapped from scratch. most were cross compilers for processors our in circuit emulators supported. actually i started with futuredata that was bought be genrad and then sold to kontron.a selfhosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language. historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. compiler compiler was the general term used in the s then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. and calling its self yet another compiler compiler. compared to the compiler compilers of s yacc is only hacc. half a compiler compiler. my term was half ass compiler compiler. there are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile its self. so metacompiler old version hasnt really separates its self from other compiler compilers. sense the start of this despute i have added referanced defination of metacompilers. the scitech dictionary mcgrawhill dictionary of scientific and technical terms th edition published by the mcgrawhill companies inc. clearly states a metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.we have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining featurethe feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compilercompiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself. defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the metastep that sets a metacompiler apart from other compilercompilersits true that a metacompiler usually defines its self. but not all metacompiler were selfhosted for various reasons. damon really went ballistic when i found a metacompiler written in pl/ in a reference he gave to prove his position. going on about me misconstruing his i do not know what.the subjects of compilercompiler syntaxdirectedcompiler and metacompiler are all closely related. and at one time were the same thing. the distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.there have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. some like book book and cwic are meta compilers an early metacompiler that did not call its self a meta compiler wasa compilerbuilding system developed by brooker and morris brooker and morris communications of the acm volume issue july it has a parsing language bnf and a machine description language mdl there is an intermediate gsl generation strategy language.cwic was based partly on schorres meta compilers and partly on lisp developed at sdc the syntax language includes features from tree meta. is unclear of schorre worked on tree meta. thhe stanford research paper does not list schorre. i implemented an extended cwic compiler compiler on a decsystem between and . i added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language macro like functions using most of the cwic generator production language. i am very familiar with how cwic worked. i have taken to using tree meta terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in cwic documentation. the rules are actually recursive evaladdevalxevaly=> has eval calling its self on the tree legs and returning local variables in x and y. that is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesnt have local variables.i started an rfc and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.val schorre submitted papers in the segforth acm group in the s. val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site now gone so cant be referanced.this field o~0

13686~i actually disagree with you firstly whilst it may be the case that people are not required to explain their actions its merely good manners to do so and the request to do so is that which makes good pages via clear and fair debates and discussions hence the existance of these areas secondly a picture that represents a page should be that of a tidy and well presented image regardless of the inane issues you talk about ie weight which should not even be an issue unless your ignorance truly knows no bounds and be reflective of what the person on the page is in kellys case a singer. but clearly i am wasting my time on this clique of a page one of which has zero interest in any kind of standard and those clearly have no interest in the thoughts of others regardless making your introduction into discussions irrelevant and pointless bearing in mind i already started that part. do what ever you like i am done wasting my time the page can look a mess ~0

13724~ june utcrace and this is clear also from the definitions above is irrelevant as a jew may have no jewish parents and be equally jewish as all other jews. very much like being american or dutch.in case ethnicity is not a result of race it mostly is a result of nationality. so apart from dutch in racial sence the autochtone blond blueeyed northerneuropide subsub race there is dutch in the sence of having the dutch nationality in other words a dutch passport.maybe theres not a thing like the jewish nationality any more as the autochtone inhabitants of judea fled their country when it came to defending it and since then spread all over the world. attempts to get their natural place back have succeeded to a certain extent but as that country now is called israel the corresponding nationality is called israelian and not jewish any more.for many years i had an eastafricanborn girlfriend whose race is considered different from mine but we both considered ourselves and were considered in our community jews and as jews felt particularly comfortable with each other and each others customs. there are also eastafricanborn persons who are to a certain extent jewish in racial sence. but if that wasnt the case with this person than a question is in how far shes still ethnically jewish since gdorb obviously doesnt have that girlfriend any more. one doesnt get some ethnicity just by being somebody elses friend for some weeks months or years. ethnicity is an old instrument for disregarding race.why should one use instruments to disregard ones own or somebody elses race?race is a biological reality and in principle theres nothing in it that gives reason to disregard it. on the contrary one might say. many if not most people are proud of their race. if some prefer to disregard it than a question is for what reason they do. there are even older ones affection attraction humanity respect exchange etc. and many newer ones and they must all scare the hell out of you.this leaves the questions what the newer ones are supposed to be and how they are supposed to scare the hell out of somebody. maybe this sentence even is a very bad sin against the wp rules and should at least be followed by a warning to the user who committed it it all depends from a nearer explanation which is demanded hereby. ~0
13725~ yes i am aware of all of these things see userfrietjes/ and solution for you and my comments on the talk page of wpaccessibility. my initial problem was that any css modifications would be ignored by inline style statements but it appears there is a way to use important to trump those changes. it just gets very tedious to have to create an entirely new style sheet because someone thinks red on green looks great. its an ongoing process. i have also been working on some greasemonkey stuff to modify such things everywhere on the web but that has been slow going given the myriad of ways people can add junk. thank you though. ~0
13726~ i really dont agree that forgery implies there is a real one. the protocols are very frequently referred to as a forgery and similarly for the hitler diaries and countless fake archaeological artifacts. the word only implies that something is presented as genuine when it isnt. a fake copy of a known painting is a forgery but so is a fake previously unknown painting of a famous artist. all dictionaries that i consulted agree e.g. merriamwebster refers to making or copying. but i wont argue about this further if nobody else agrees. i can also go with fraudulent book which is more informative than fraud and not so soapboxy as lie. fraudulent document would also be ok it wasnt first published as a book. talk ~0

13731~image source problem with imagethanks for uploading image i noticed that the files description page currently doesnt specify who created the content so the copyright status is unclear. if you did not create this file yourself you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. if you obtained it from a website then a link to the website from which it was taken together with a restatement of that websites terms of use of its content is usually sufficient information. however if the copyright holder is different from the websites publisher their copyright should also be acknowledged.as well as adding the source please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesnt have one already. if you created/took the picture audio or video then the tag can be used to release it under the gfdl. if you believe the media meets the criteria at wikipedianonfree content use a tag such as or one of the other tags listed at wikipediaimage copyright tagsfair use. see wikipediaimage copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.if you have uploaded other files consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them too. you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link. unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if the image is copyrighted under a nonfree license per wikipediafair use then the image will be deleted hours after . if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you.~0

13735~your comments at phase iire a day is actually quite a few. for comparison there are articles currently proposed for deletion as i write this which equates to only about a day and that number would probably have been less before the unsourced blp controversy got going. as i wrotewhen this arbcom started at january we were at unreferenced blps today we are at . that is articles we as a community have referenced in days and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. i can reference articles in a day / of the proposed this is very doable folks.i would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. it is very doable. i am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools see for exampleusertalkthepopeyourideaatwikipediarequestsforcomment.fbiographiesoflivingpeople as userthepope wrote on my talk pagethe wpaustralia project had a list of over names just over weeks ago. its now under . is still fairly unworkable so weve split them up again into smaller topics. other lists have popped up cricket rugby union india and probably many more. this is all doable but it does take time it does get a bit boring it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag but it can work. one other good thing about these lists is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist almost like having multiple watchlists. this is very possible. as an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past years and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles this is a wonderful comprimise with so much potential i would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal. the new and improved ~0

13752~ we need secondary reliable sources to select which parts of the book or ideas are noteworthy you do not need secondary sources to describe what the content of the book itself is. the book itself is the source for that. you are distorting the policies you claim to be following. this appears to be an attempt to simply remove all content from the page including perfectly neutral content that simply describes what the book says. i note that youve been tbanned recently for similar behavior. if you edit the page again without discussing this in detail before making further alterations to remove perfectly reasonable content i will bring this up for arbitration immediately. ~0

13832~new criticism redux dear moni – i think you’re on to something when you wrote “new criticism should be represented with emphasis appropriate to how much information exists.”the impact of the new critics is still felt today even wolff’s analysis is influenced by it. h. bruce franklin wrote“the hallmark of new critical methodologyintricately detailed and nuanced readings of textswas actually a corollary of these texts deemed worthy of study texts filled with elaborate ambiguities and ironies texts therefore not easily accessible to common readers.” go read wolff you’ll see.providing a section on second wave feminist “critique” and the new critics is a balanced and informative – approach. both should be expanded prudently i’ve initiated that project. undue weight wpundue ? if you take the trouble to read the section you’ll see it’s related to arguments about say “global warming” where .% of scientists recognize the human causes and .% do not. providing equal space for the latter is an example of “undue weight.” applying it to a section on the new criticism is a red herring.as the untruthkeeper/maria opined “everything in moderation” except a proprietary approach to editing and a “dog in the manger” attitude towards new contributors. oh by the way the material that was dumped in the new criticism was done so without including the reference rather slipshod i’d say. scamper over there and take care of that “edit” won’t you maria? mysweetoldetc.~0

13836~haplogroup l lineages are relatively infrequentless than % throughout europe with the exception of iberia where frequencies as high as .% percent have been reported. these lineages had previously been associated with the african slave trade. however an analysis by gonzalez et al revealed that most of the l lineages matched northwest african l lineages rather than contemporary subsaharan l lineages. the authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the subsaharan l lineages entered iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods. haplogroup l lineages are present at low frequencies in eastern europe. though a high diversity of african mtdna lineages have been detected few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in europe to form monophyletic clusters. malyarchuk et al detected only two monophyletic clusters lb and lb in russians with an estimated age no greater than years. malyarchuk et al identified african lb la lb ld and m clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. lb lb and ld had matches with west african populations indicating that these lineages probably entered europe through iberia. one lineage laa appeared to be much older indicating that it may have entered europe in prehistoric times. this clade was possibly related to la clades identified in individuals of ashkenazi heritage from france germany poland romania and russia. la lineages are widespread throughout africa as a result the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain. ~0

13858~ collegiality i defy anyone to find so much as an ounce of collegiality in yesterdays sham and atrociously scripted bill of attainder.thomas jefferson was demonstrating collegial insight when he led the civilized world in abandoning bill of attainder having recognized that its a corrosive and corrupt tool of government that inevitably sinks any regime that comes to rely on it. shortly after the founders outlawed bill of attainder in article i of the us constitution the british followed suit abandoning both parliamentary bill of attainder and monarchial bill of attainder.its disturbing to witness you and other misguided officials reintroducing this antiquated relic from the rubbish heap of political history into the current practices of wikiversity. is this the kind of unwise practice you wish to teach to impressionable youth of the st century? can you imagine what would happen to anyone who tried to adopt and employ that hoary and unsustainable practice in the real world of an authentic st century learning organization?moulton ~0

13868~i strongly suggest the title of the article and all further references to the disease within the article be changed from crohns disease to crohn disease. the disease was named after one of the pathologists who first described the condition he did not have the disease himself which is what having the s added to the end of the last name implies. e.g. down did not have down syndrome so it should not be called downs syndrome whereas those who refer to als as lou gehrigs disease are correct in the term because he had this disease. from my experiences in caring for patients with the condition some relate stories to me of having been referred to as having crohns and are quite offended by this.~0

13890~ it is all just terminology perhaps all this argument is about nothing but terminology. does anyone disagree with any of the following statements? it is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly the players initial pick is random and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat. the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door and the host has opened door is between / and depending on the hosts door preference. this is clearly a conditional probability the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door and the host has opened door is between / and depending on the hosts door preference. this is clearly a conditional probability the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is / for all host preferences. morgan call this the unconditional case maybe this is where the confusion arises. the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is / for all host preferences. the probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is / for all host preferences. youre right. and notice that in case opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition because it is part of the rules of the game. the only condition if you would consider the full model there is the initial picking of door . in case there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case . but ... notice that in the mhp a specific door has been chosen and a door opened. i continue here. the difficulty is what we do mean by probability. if you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened there is as i mentioned no condition. if you mean a door has been opened but i do not know which one and i want to average over all cases concerning the same door the answer depends on the door and is a number between / and . i do not quite agree with you. if we average over all cases where a door has been opened but you do not know which one the answer is / if we include all possible host strategies in our average. the only way to get an answer other than / is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time. nijdam do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door? if the player picks randomly the probability of winning is /. if the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement. who else agrees? i agree with and . i find and somewhat ambiguous without further clarification for example i dont know precisely what you mean by for all host preferences. i would agree with the following revised versionsby for all host preferences i mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to always open door where possible always open door where possible choose randomly where there is a choice or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules. the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door is /. the probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door is /. the probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is /.these are clearly unconditional statements that say nothing about the player deciding after the~0

13903~there’s definitely nothing in the original books to suggest that their fantasy world has anything to do with real countries. their customs have a definite scandinavian flavour but only in the same way that the shire is english and space aliens tend to speak like americans. so as literature theyre definitely finnish but not in a geographical sense. i suspect the english title has more to do with swiss family robinson than anything else as odd a bit of intertextuality as ive ever seen its suggestion of their nationality isnt any more meaningful than its suggestion that trollkarlens hatt is the first book. and this is minor compared to the liberties taken by for example translations of pippi longstocking from the same era.~0

13917~im still waiting on you to cite your source for the allegation that whether something is convex or concave depends on the perspective of the observer or whether its outward or inward or however you want to phrase it. my position is that there is no ambiguity in describing it as simply convex. i dont think the turner and godfray articles are correct and just use a different phrasing. im alleging that theyre just outright wrong. ~0

13926~there are two criteria at play here first does it bear the final fantasy title in any form or region? this covers most of what weve got. second if the first does not apply does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the final fantasy series. kingdom hearts does since about half of the major npcs are from the series. ehrgeiz does since it has several playable characters one of whom is actually on the cover of the game from final fantasy vii. secret of evermore might as well i was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles but if someone wants to argue otherwise im listening. super mario rpg does not fit under either of these categories it was never called final fantasy super mario rpg or whatever and it has but one piece of music to connect it to the series. –~0

13936~ the phonology of urdu appears to be different enough from that of hindi because of however artificial phonemes not for instance present in hindi as they are of persian derivation. wpcfork simply does not apply because here is not a case of i quote the this page in a nutshell box articles should not be split into multiple articles just so each can advocate a different stance on the subject since there is no stance to be taken its just a matter of urdu phonology being different from hindi phonology. if you want the differences between urdu and hindi phonology to be more prominently highlighted than they are now you can as i said do it yourself you cant expect to force others to add content surely. as to codeswitching for other languages this seems to be tackled by having a separate article about the common codeswitching mixtures spanglish and so on and linking them in the see also sections so feel free to do this if you want for what im concerned. ~0

13941~ about . i already emailed this report on . i hope that someone of serious wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the wikipedia dignityhelloi do understand that wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.i noticed that you have a person whose nick name is and whose number of edits goes over per day very often spanning hours dayly. this person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.the best way to describe his/her behaviour and contributions are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this wayi am probably from the usa and like to scrap others contributions due to what i call factual correctness instead of knowing the facts and reporting themive noticed that you are editing someones contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections not reading references at all. moreover not reading the references nor providing your own you are demanding new references.also on january th youve made edits on various articles in the span of more than hoursmerge clean copy revert etc. dont you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day hours and hours practically not contributing anything serious to wikipedia only irritating many people this way???when seeing that the existing edition of the croatia section here was reduced by userspylab to just sentences out of which four were marked by the citation needed tag . moreover userspylab completed his own editorial work by adding {unreferenceddate=november } and {weasel} tags on the top of this page how a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? i reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. ultimately the existing edits cannot be rewritten or destroyed by just throwing claim replaced content with info from neonazism in croatia because old version didnt focus on neonazism as he did.all my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations failed. instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously userspylab started throwing accusations last edit brok rr rule you may be blocked sockpuppetry etc. and selfpraising userspylab work as superior and claiming that i do not know what neonazism is. my attempt questions to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already are removed from the talk page and when ive put back the deleted questions userspylab ignored them completely.i had impression that i have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. then i went further and examined the whole userspylab editorial work and noticed that userspylab commited more than changes within days i.e. more than fifty edits per day november december . in that period of time userspylab was busy by the wikipedia editing on november hours november hours edits december hours december hours december hours december hours december hours december hours and december hours.the content of userspylab edits were spelling check version reverts removal of links copypaste etc. so it is quite clearly that i had to deal with a mentally challenged personi just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like userspylab. as per his/her own words as an neonazism in croatia section editor spylab publicly claimsactually its not complicated at all. the revert war has nothing to do with point of view and i am not an expert on croatia at all.my note how then this person should edit some subject she is not familirar with? also all references written in croatian and given here in the neonazism in croatia were removed. as per spylab question here ~0

13949~that statement is the only thing i cannot believable about the pirate bay trial. i hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss. my friend operates a website that draws people per month on average. with the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay he earns us dollar for every thousand visitors. for pirate bay this equates to thousand dollars for every visitor they have. they claim million active members so figure a lower number of million per day. this brings in as high as $ per day if im staying conservative. this is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website ie multiple hits by a person per day. so the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of grand. days in a year unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income. more likely several million. with these numbers if they only get a million hits per day which is well within everyones including piratebays estimations then they would still be making on the order of $ per year. there is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year which doesnt seem logical given my knowledge of networking.now they might be incorporating expansion costs ie the new server banks in russia and other countries and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss. hate to break it to ya this means theyre just spending money they already earned. so yes they do in fact earn that much money they just spend it as fast as they earn it. ...~0

13972~ december utcforgive me if i try to be brief. its very early in the morning here and i havent slept yet. its understandable that you didnt know of any active projects connected to wpcvg when you made your proposal its not as if any of us are being paid to be here are we? now that i know why we werent told i dont have a problem with that part.ill read over the current proposal sometime today. i didnt respond to your comments at wpmk because the previous discussion of the mk template split which i was involved in raised issues brought up in your proposal thats how we were told. i believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation so the changes were reverted. i still have the same concerns about your proposal. other wpmk members may still share this opinion have other issues or are not bothered. thats why ive asked you to discuss your plans for the mk template with the rest of us before you proceed.personally i agree with the aesthetic changes youre proposing but i disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. the characters article you linked to was a good start but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series if only to make navigation more convenient. thats all that im prepared to say while im halfasleep but if you have any more questions for me personally ill respond when im able to. ~0

13981~ demand for too many sources some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. for example the request for a secondary source for the fact that the inquirer has criticized the publication of egs real name. this is utter rubbish. from wpnoran article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should only make descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable educated person without specialist knowledge and make no analytic synthetic interpretive explanatory or evaluative claims.the section in question states the inquirer has criticized this deletion as well as the revelation of the models real name during the deletion discussions by wikipedia users the models name and identity had been kept confidential by the inquirer.we comply with the claim is only descriptive it reproduces what the inq stated in their article and is easily verifiable. the information is also not interpreted thus we also comply with . as such im removing the redundant second source.further i recently added a citation for mike magees quote from businessweek. again i am removing this. the quote appears in the earlier reference to the same businessweek article and citations are allowed to span multiple sentences. ~0

13988~i didnt really have a problem with the edits except one but i dont feel very strongly about that one. however i do object with not having this stuff on the talk page. since i wrote the article researched it rewrote it researched it again and keep adding as i find out more the man is elusive hes probably the most important figure of the th c. to be a complete ghost in reference works i keep it on my watchlist. any breath and id see it. originally it seems that it needed to go to a higher standard because of sections. sheesh man but thats an insulting message for an article under heavy research and revision like that anyway please break it into subsections would have gotten the sections done had it been on the talk page. instead though.... its a suboptimal method at best. no one should tag without extremely clear wording and they shouldnt do that until the talk page has failed. ~0
