10000,im not sure what the rule is on that score actually. looking at the german barons category there seems to be an even split between those with freiherr in the title and those without. considering most of his life was lived in a german republic i would be more inclined to leave his title out but if somebody else wants to include i wouldnt mind. for me though leave it the way it is for the sake of convenience as much as anything. ill look for a reference later on.,0
10001, the david irving analogy is illustrative. to call someone a holocaust denier is to disparage him. however that doesnt mean the label is inaccurate on the contrary the label is abundantly supported by reliable sources who have discussed irvings work. similarly attaching conspiracy theorist to griffin acts to disparage him but that doesnt mean the label isnt accurate. it is amply supported by various rs. the admin who said we cant label griffin a ct was simply mistaken. ,0

10004,will and elizabeths relationship someone keeps removing text i write that elizabeth is angry at will after it is learned that he made a secret bargain with sao feng. the point in the last two movies is that it remains doubtful until the end whether or not they can overcome their differences and be together. at first will believes elizabeth loves jack then hes upset that elizabeth did not confide in him that she was responsible for jacks death. in a reverse scenario elizabeth feels betrayed that will secretly made a bargain with sao feng violating her trust and putting the crew in danger. she becomes even more estranged from him because of this. it is not until the movies climax that the audience learns if they will overcome their differences and love one another although they are again torn apart.,0

10009,hi elen apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag i have generally seen your own actions as even handed and i would extend this comment to a few of the other editors all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how wikipedia works internally i confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and i point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for jwasm i bothered to write for wikipedia. the same antagonist tried to trash the masm page that i rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. an earlier editor tried to get some content into the masm page by scouring the masm web site and linking to web pages that i wrote for the masm user base and while i was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the masm page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed in the face of endless obstruction i will simply resolve the problem from outside wikipedia. you are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up. regards and thanks for your efforts.,0

10013,no it doesnt. that edit was a long time ago it was immediately reverted and a warning was issued by the reverting editor. no repeat of the incident has occurred either on that article or any other and if there were a need to deal with it more harshly then it would have been done then. for first time vandalism a warning is enough and that was all that was needed so the subject is closed.,0

10023,i wouldnt want to have things that i did at age twelve dug up and thrown at me but as bluejay young has noted this is exactly what happened during helen kellers lifetime. there are several people today who say that essentially helen was subject to sockpuppeting and that she never had a mind of her own. however the other concerns are legit imo. i think theres a better chance of the frost kings article being referenced and better written if it were merged into this article since people are much more likely to search for helen keller than the frost kings assuming those people had good intentions and are bold which they arent. ,0

10035, ka sesotho kgotso ntate mcdonald.thanks for your input at the sesotho talk page. i guess it really does depend on ones experiences but i do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names sesotho and basotho eg. ambiguity of sotho which could refer to half a dozen different things but i feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it especially for a name which is not commonly used by average english speakers.i am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.what exactly do the peace corps do exactly? judging from the film elollipop it appears that its mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level which sounds like a lot of fun yes i probably should take a look at the wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff. thewhat?? ,0

10044,it is clearly designed to denigrate those who have raised objections to the presence of islam in danish society.you should perhaps check out the articles from the u.s. dept of state. there is one on human rights in dk and one on religious freedom. this is factual academic work and it is far more damning that anything i have written yet. i will soon be incorporating some of these new findings provided by the u.s. dept of state and the u.s. ambassador to dk into this wikipedia article.if dk has a policy of religious freedom yet officially have a program of harassing immigrants that will not gain any favor in terms of international relations. it is virtually impossible to have an article that is factual and also presents a view that the danes are victims of muslim invaders because the facts do not support this. you have a bias towards a sanitized version where the dpp is just a conservative party and then you and your cohorts choose to delete their racist statements made in parliament and just about every fact that makes denmark look bad. its unfortunate that the truth and facts make dk look bad but it is what it is... the u.s. dept of state reports are far more damning and if you think that is biased it is in fact you who are biased. please keep your opinions between your underground conservative groups. we want facts and citations here.,0

10046, examples bitcoins can be exchanged between any two computers provided each computer has bitcoin software and a wallet file. some websites maintain wallet files and bitcoin software as a service to their users allowing users to send and receive bitcoin even if they do not own a personal computer. no intermediate financial institution or government is required to verify transactions or transfer funds.the above is not acceptable mainly because bitcoins are not solely exchanged between computers. that is not how the system operates entirely and its in fact and understatement to the networking technology. a bitcoin transaction is simply signing the bitcoin address of another and transferring the coins. you can do that with any device. the website statement is misleading and implies people are trading bitcoins out of a library. that is not why these websites exist and you will need a citation for that claim. even then thats not where that claim belongs. the lead is for summarizing the article. not adding more content. also during this edit you completely butchered the description on how the bitcoin ledger system operates. you talk about how transactions are confirmed but you totally deleted the big picture bitcoin is a giant transaction log based on cryptography. you are not literally sending coins to each other by reassigning balances through digital signatures that are confirmed as following the rules by the network. you are making things very vague and not easier to understand.and again you are making things inaccurate. if you continue to add unsourced and inaccurate material i will be taking this to dispute resolution. ,0

10050,i had nearly moved on when i felt completely compelled to comment on this statement probably better than most clan websites which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the th century. then i do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles. i can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? this makes no sense to me. history is what it is it should not change for the sake of change. if it was accurate over years ago it is just as accurate today. again if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to rewrite it for either personal gain or an agenda. that is exactly what has happened with the origins for many highland clans. for any that might be interested william skenes and john murrays collaboration of the highlanders of scotland their origin history and antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. this is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the highland clans. it asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the chieftainship by usurping the rightful lines. youll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to rewrite history for their own selfish gain. youd have to read the book to see how this played out but as i said before nearly all of the highland clans being bastardized as norman/anglohorman/flemish etc. are really dalriadan and pictish mixes. examples would be campbell cameron grant davidson wallace etc. i of course have distant ydna connections to all of these surnames but i know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. ill admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage but they all have a lineage going back to the picts and gaels. i am of that lineage which is quite rare and continues to be established. the masses are not of that lineage they are a mix if ra other rb haplotypes the i haplotypes etc. i will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families not even related through a shared male ancestor sharing a surname or clan. my concern is with the origins only and the original chiefly lines. and please dont tell me how we are a mix of so much dna i am only referring to ydna the male lines. i am not talking about mtdna nor autosomal. what i dont understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate sourced information. there is substantial factually accurate sourced information out there however it is not my intent to correct these erroneous articles or to present an opposing view. there is no opposing view there is either the truth or their are lies. either the celtic version is correct or the comyn version is correct or neither is correct. there cant factually be multiple versions of an origin it is what it is and there is only one true origin. this is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. i would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there and not contests of who can out edit who which is what wikipedia appears to be. there my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. clan davidson is celtic it descended from celts and it has no connection to the comyn family. it did not descend from a comyn male. they came from a very ancient gaelic ancestor an ancestor shared by several highland clans before surnames even were in use. one other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the davidsons and the macphersons....this never happened. the battle was between the clans fighting for the chief of the clan chattan the battle was fought between the mackintoshs and the macphersons were the true chiefly line but were outdocumented by the usurping mackintosh. this is pretty much exactly what is happening here on this very page. i hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and lets bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. it was originally much more factually accurate but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.,0

10053,hi looie.thank you for advising me of this. appreciated. i really do love wikipedia but i must insist that im allowed to love it on my own terms because i can do no other or go without which i candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear ....as i think i must surely have made clear i really do have nothing further to add to the comments about buddhist sex abuse cases i have already made. i do hope the page is restored.currently im fleshing out the biographies of leveller women. ive already supplied a stub for katherine chidley and im presently working on one for userrinpoche/mary overton wife of richard overton. it will take a few days before its ready yet.mary overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life. she was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to millwall prison in londonan absolutely dreadful place. she refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away. they too refused out of common humanity. the bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the london streets while people spat abuse. well i dont know but i think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to go fuck yourself which is absolutely frightful of course. the baby died some six months later.regarding the bsac debacle what ive done with my katherine chidley stub is that on the talk page ive added at the top a section for contributors in which i myself as a contributing editor expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it the lack of a definition for the term controversialist for example which i can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition. ill be doing the same in all future new pages i contribute in the hope of avoiding the same difficulties i had with bsac assuming of course thats okay with the wiki community.thank you for your attention.,0

10066, im sorry but you are factually wrong. as an automotive engineer with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics i can assure you that traction control and edl are operate in two very different methods. all traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the nondriven axle any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will only result in either a both driven wheels on the same axle being braked or b the engine ecu reducing engine output or c a combination of a and b. edl does not compare differences between front and rear axles it only compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle and brakes just one wheel there is no engine power intervention. whilst they are both addon functions of modern esp systems and use the same related hardware and electronics the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics. dont forget wikipedia articles are not considered valid references for other wikipedia articles so if you have read something contrary on another wiki article it doesnt automatically mean it is correct talk to teutonictamer ,0

10088, jesus and messianic prophecy hey. i dont know if this is technically where i should be posting this sorry if its not. fine if retort isnt % appropriate then ill use counterargue that is the meaning i was trying to get across.but i think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with wikipedias guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general. you said christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a timeline for the messiahs actions and the new testament especially the book of revelation detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . this is a bit vague and raises some questions. which christians? where did they say that? how did they detail it? can you reference it from a notable/seminotable scholar?first i cant point to a place in the old testament where the timeline doesnt exist you know what i mean? there is no jewish timeline so it cannot be referenced. but the new testament does have a christian timeline as detailed in the book of revelation. now which christians hold to this belief? essentially all of them all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the bible which is essentially all. where did christian authors detail this belief? in the bible how did they detail it? they wrote it in the bible that is why i made bible references which scholar can i quote? how about john the apostle who wrote revelation? is one of the founders of christianity an acceptable source on the subject?i find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing christians believe jesus came back from the dead as detailed in various places including the gospels and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting bible passages and asking which christians believe that?. you said this includes jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse revelation . although it does reference the bible if left alone it sounds rather confusing. it also does not specifically reference a line from revelation nor does it reference which version of the bible it quotes king james niv etc which could mean a slight difference in the quote. if you want many specific bible quotes then ill put those in and ill list if its kjv or whatever. but i dont think thats required as my broad citation of rev does clearly explain exactly what im talking about including a physical kingdom on earth a messianic age of righteousness and so on. just because i didnt dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesnt mean they arent there any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.if i had written the story of noahs ark is in genesis would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? just because i didnt give a synopsis with ten references doesnt mean its unworthy just look it up what bothers me most is how this whole thing started when i tried to correct incorrect data on your site the line that christians dont believe in a physical resurrection. that line had no references so even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post dont they? you cant delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all. im sure youll disagree with me on this one but most of all i think that my contribution didnt need to cite anything as it is such common knowledge that christians believe in judgment day an age of peace etc. i feel like im in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. its almost as bad as someone posting christians dont believe jesus was tried executed and came back to life then i post that they do citing luke then you saying that it is too vague etc. it was pure courtesy to give the citation its such common knowledge that christians believe these thingsbut whatever ill repost with a several morespecific quotes. and btw you may think whoa this guy care way too much about wikipedia and im a mod but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. and i hate inconsistency.... ,0

10107, daniel your encyclopedia is a joke and the article about sanchez is a great illustration of the many and sundry reasons it is a joke. every single one of your pillars and policies has been violated in the article itself the discussion thread and the administration of it. you and your cabal have allowed the subject to edit his own article youve blocked verified facts from the article youve demonstrated a lack of neutrality and good faith throughout youve abandoned any pretense of common sense or evenhandedness. the result is an article that is just plain false. but you see this doesnt matter at wikipedia because at wikipedia all truth is negotiable when means it is politically determined. the good thing is that aside from anything that happens at the sanchez whitewash page the world at large is onto you and your crew. wikipedias lack of respect for truth and its wholly capricious and abitrary administration not to mention the falsification of biographies by its insiders and the insertion of corporate propaganda into articles has been discovered. so go on and lecture me. really do it. it doesnt matter daniel because you are standing on the deck of a sinking ship. ,0

10125,agreed. i amended the article after the chessbase article came out. i think its only fair to report it without endorsing or refuting the possibility that topalov did in fact cheat. dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying topalov was accused of cheating and topalov cheated so it is possible that he will now delete my edit arguing that topalov didnt cheat. its frustrating and time consuming arguing with characters like that. and while i had plenty of passive support last year id appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around should dionyseus choose to make another big stink. apparently dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information no matter how factual. of course this is the same guy who last year edited kramniks article so that it started with a list of his match losses. of course i wouldnt want to infringe upon wikis tradition of love charity and respect so i feel i should clarify my position insofar as i absolutely do not regard dionyseus to be a blight on wikipedia a mental degenerate incapable of lucid reasoning or incapable of language use. he is certainly none of those things. and admins may take that as an official statement. ,0

10174,ive read through the above and ive looked up the article in question on the nejm website. is correct in saying he can make basic calculations without it being considered original research but your calculation is not correct. the figures involve the median survival rates not the mean rates and as such simply subtracting one figure from the other produces an inaccurate statistic. the median survival rate is simply the middle point between the two extremes so if one person died after one year and one person died after two years the median survival rate would be . years even if % of people died after . years. therefore your figure implies something that is not the case.the abstract explicitly states the followingthis reduction represented a .month improvement in median survival . months in the sipuleucelt group vs. . months in the placebo group.i think that if the survival advantage was . months much more attention would be drawn to this figure rather than the only figure to be highlighted of . months. based on this im going to agree with . whilst i cant force you to drop the subject i recommend that you stop reverting edits and if you feel it is necessary request further arbitration. in ænigmate talk ,0

10184,describing the jesus bloodline as being linked to traditionalist esoteric christianity will always exist without a citation and reliable and independent source. if jesus bloodline is to be linked to esoteric christianity it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of esoteric christianity that has been influenced by margaret starbird. and this can be easily done. there are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric christianity that was inspired by margaret starbird. traditional esoteric christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to origen of alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. the common interpretation of gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of christ. this can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. it was the book holy blood and holy grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that gnosticism believed that jesus christ was a human being and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the jesus bloodline. again it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the jesus christ of gnosticism was not a physical human being. none of the comments here can be described as original research. ,0

10241,one of your contributions is definitely extremely unbalanced und not tolerable so there is a coi. without this note i would believe that this was intentional but with your note it seems that you are just missinformed by antioss people like eduard bloch... let me explain in detail the text in the mentioned diff does not belong into the licensing section at all. it may be a candidate for the critisizm section on the debian article to explain problematic behavior of debian against cdrtools firefox ... after it has been corrected to reflect the truth. the named text tries to belittle cdrtools with false claims so let me give the correct background information all cd/dvd/bd drives ever made are scsi devices. atapi is just one of many scsi transport mechanisms and while atapi is fully integrated into the scsi stack on solaris x since this was not the case on linux in . this is a design problem on linux. cdrtools is highly portable to different platforms not counting different cpus separately and the man page mentions that it grants equivalent behavior on all supported platforms the vast majority of all platforms do either not have device nodes at all or do not have a relation between a specific device node and a specific scsi device. windos and mac os x both do not have device nodes for scsi devices so % of all computers in the world cannot use device node based scsi addressing. and make it obvious that you cannot use device nodes in a portable implementation and that only the official scsi addressing scheme is portable across platforms. in september linus torvalds introduced a fatal linux kernel scsi interface incompatibility while claiming to fix a security bug. this incompatibility was introduced exactly when a new stable cdrtools relase was puiblished after a long time of bug fixing and code freeze in cdrtools. the patches from debian eduard bloch that you seem to reference and that have been published in are full of bugs. in spring there have been aprox. unique bug reports against cdrtools in the bug tracking systems of various linux distros. nearly of these bugs have been a result of the patches from eduard bloch. the other bugs have been fixed in the original code between september and august after debian stopped updating their source. btw as there is no development activities on cdrkit since may the vast majority of these bugs is still present in the defective and dead fork from debian. in special there is no code in the debian fork that works around the scsi interface incompatibility mentioned in . cdrtools is a really openminded project. any patch that was send and that follows the quality requirements in the contributing rules has been accepted. the patches from eduard bloch did not follow the quality rules. the cdrtools project does not accept patches that harm the code sorry but this is needed if you like to give long term support for a program. note that the first libscg code was written in august years ago and that i have other oss e.g. star that is maintained since years.this list of explanations can be found in the internet if you use a search engine...i did write it many times in similar wording in the past after people came up with similar false claims.please also note that the fork from debian was started in may years ago. when debian claimed to start their cdrkit fork in late they did just change the name on my request. so this cdrkit includes all bugs that have been introduced by debian since early . cdrkit did never publish a release that has no known bugs at the time of being published so cdrkit did never raise above alpharelease quality.as your request looks collaborative i am sure that you understand that you have been fooled by unfriendly people and fully remove the paragraph in question.,0

10251,i am wondering what is the notability of de waal to include him in a dozen ? articles as the sole source for a claim. has he written anything other than that work in journals or other peer reviewed publications about those specific years of history? so i concur with vartan and any neutral user cant do otherwise when de waal has been used more than his notability would allow as sole source in countless articles. as he is a sole source he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless grandmaster or atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of de waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including shushi or the armenian genocide. the fact that he presents the armenian genocide as an armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the s of an alleged . million azeri exterminated by armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history. im afraid this time around the adding of de waal has reached the limit. this is not de waal encyclopaedia to have his position on everything especially when he is the sole source for the position he represents. ,0

10257,oh dear im glad you stuck around gerda believe it or not i like to have an infobox in some articles too sports geography science film etc.. i even considered one here but figured the box would look pretty short and redundant. i do agree i have never been one for skirting around the issue and a more direct approach is sometimes needed. however i am now deciding to steer clear of such discussions at ani and other public places as it really is a never ending loop of the similar arguments you and i have seen many many times before. your passion on the linked word would have been my passion as a review alas i dont think there is much more there for me. if you can wait until fac i would be pleased for a reminder then talk ,0

10262,i vividly remember my elementry school days when the other kids would shun me and not let me into their stupid little groups. the boys were all friends as for the girls they had two groups. one was the popular girls group and the other was the unpopular girls group. you may think that i would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group but i didnt. they locked me out of their little group and wouldnt even talk to me. they teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. i never got invited to any parties after nd grade i never had any friends. the boys basically ignored me until th grade when they were the ones who teased me mercelessly while they flirted with the other girls. all the other girls would talk about was boys when they werent bragging to each other about thier home life. they never let me play with them and the teacher didnt make them include me. in lunch and recess i would just sit alone or cry alone. in th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. the teacher just shook his head. kids are cruel and i will never ever never forget the torture i endured as a child. yes i do think kids are buttheads.,0

10282,stop deleting my addition. you muboshgu/mephistophelian sayplease do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. they arefor discussion related to improving the article. they are not to be used as aforum or chat. if you continue to use talk pages as you do you may be blockedfrom editing. you are using the talk page to push a pov rather than addressingthe article in a constructive manner. please stop.i am not generally discussing a topic i am not chatting. i am not pushing a p.o.v.. if you do not understand basic english grammar you haveno business telling me anything. fact commas are used in this context toseparate a list a series of related clauses. grammar is not a matter of ageneral discussion or chatting or a point of view. it is a technicallyprecise set of rules and in this case a set of rules that demonstrate thatthe foundation of the issue is a fraud. this is not opinion it is fact itis relevant to the article it is foundational to the article. i am talkingabout improving the article by clarifying the foundation according to therules of english grammar as any literate person can see. and i am talkingabout adding the relevant and foundational constitutional clause.from talk guidelines why dont you review them there is reasonable allowance for speculation suggestion and personalknowledge on talk pages with a view to prompting further investigation. make the extra effort so that other people understand you. beingfriendly is a great help. it is always a good idea to explain your views itis less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it. explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrateits validity to others and reach consensus. article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article deal with facts the talk page can be used to park material removed from the article due toverification or other concerns while references are sought or concernsdiscussed. the talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits. new proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by othereditors if you wish. do not threaten people for example threatening people with admins you know or having them banned for disagreeing with you. editing or even removing others comments is sometimes allowed. but you should exercise caution in doing so and normally stop if there is anyobjection.as i previously posted here the article should be improved by making it clearin the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the publicsince there is no natural born citizen requirement that is applicable today.that is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article nota matter of opinion and a matter of grammatical fact.if i say no animal except a mouse or a rat at the time i give the signalshall be captured then i am saying only mice and rats shall be captured atthe time i give the signal. my order has no validity at any other point in time. similarly the requirement for natural born citizen only applied at the time of the adoption of this constitution. it does not apply today andthe following clause should be part of the article since it is the clause atthe foundation of the issue in the articleno person except a natural born citizen or acitizen of the united states at the time of theadoption of this constitution shall be eligibleto the office of president neither shall anyperson be eligible to that office who shall nothave attained to the age of thirty five years andbeen fourteen years a resident within the unitedstates.... ,0

10286,combining options and point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. heres a reworking reinserting thatsustainability in a very general sense is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. however over the last years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems and to humanity in general. as applied to the human community sustainability has been expressed as this is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. the term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes functions biodiversity and productivity into the future. there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. consequently for many people sustainability has come to mean a call for action for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the earth’s finite resource limits.sustainability has become a controversial and complex allpurpose term that is widely applied in many different ways to different levels of biological organization e. e.g.wetlands gardens prairies forests to different levels of human organization sustainable households e.g. ecovillages ecomunicipalities sustainable cities towns sustainable countries and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g. sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture sustainable economics.i sure hope that this one passes muster for all.,0

10309,is there any halfdecent cantonese pop music or is it all treacle? jun utcis there really westerners listening to cantopop? i doubt the sentence to western ears... is npov.the article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝 singer 仙度拉 and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that cantopop as a second grade music i.e. for old uneducated person only. and it was sammy hui who finally pushed cantopop to overtake mandarin pop as the music of choice for hk youths. yes no mention at all of the gu gaafaiwong jim collaboration. no mention at all of the popularity of tvb tv theme songs while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two seemed to be the only people producing original material. ill try to npov the article more but i claim no responsbility on contentyou cant get much further from my musical domain than cantopop. jun utc no problem. i bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular cantopop songs but not the best. i will get the same preception if i listen only to madonna or britney spears.i didnt mean that i wouldnt like it. i meant that ive never heard any and i certainly dont know the history behind it so my editing is limited to grammar and attempts at npov. jun utc tones i heard that cantonese music differs from mandarin in that mandarin respects the language tones in the melody but cantonese doesnt. is it true? good cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody as all chinese dialects are tonesensitive. what you heard is a recent disaster in hk music beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important. but there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. cantonese is more tonal than mandarin. mandarin only has tones for each pronunciation but cantonese has at least tones according to most dictionaries. some author even claims there are tones in cantonese. even though written chinese can be pronunced in cantonese or mandarin but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a cantonese song in mardarin nor vice versa. many popular tunes get both cantonese and mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects. oct utcyes but mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.ive heard people talk about cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. and how do cantopop artists deal with music piracy? cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as european or american artists i.e. virtually nothing they can do but i was under the impression that in hk and canton media piracy was much much higher than in europe or america. but there still are cantopop artists. are the economic models different? do they resort to corporate patronage? ... curious how did you hear that height in cantonese areas? jun utc i meant south china in general but it should affect cantopop. my source is slashdot . ehem. i think i read something in wired of bruce sterling finding dirtcheap pirated media there but i dont find it. i though tit was common knowledge. you have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. joey yung and twins going on tv and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a the joey yung interview i was referring to she claimed that she was making no money on her albums but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. with a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and example jade kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars in the mainland for a dozen or so minute mini if you are popular enough you can make money through isnt a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isnt e,0

10313,userccfsdca hi i’m userccfsdca christopher corbettfiacco and i understand the concerns expressed by many of you regarding the articles i’ve posted at wikipedia the past week or so. i am in fact the author of the whole world calendar book of holidays around the world as stated an asyet unpublished book which is based upon the selfpublished the whole world calendar and email me at wholeworldcalendar and i’ll be glad to send you a sample page and info on ordering if interested. i have sent wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that i am not selfpromoting. my mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article which i’ll do as soon as i have the time. my intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important and having spent two years researching the topic i can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information try to find out what earthquake victims memorial day is in armenia and you’ll see what i mean. it is my intent to selfpublish the book within months if i cannot find a publisher. meanwhile feel free to delete my articles as desired. i’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after i’ve ascertained that i am in fact doing it right. meanwhile i’m not copying from somebody else those articles are my own that’s the way i write. thanks much. chris corbettfiacco,0

10331,deleting max katsarelas it upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for max katsarelas. you obviously didnt read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion. you display the insight of a year old women that has suffered from alzheimers for years. you dont even deserve a user page you pc using paper pusher. ive said it once and ill say it again its people like you with little to no creativity and a desk job from that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet youd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the s. additionally why dont i tag your username for a copyright infringement? if its true that youre a fan of the simpsons then i may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of homers comedic stylings.so as you probably read through this and decide youre going to delete everything i have just taken the time to write id like to know a few things. . do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? if you did i would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion you had diarrhea. aint it just the worse?. are you married or still living in your mothers basement? it was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mothers basement because hey most wikipedians do anyways. however the point is if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man im sure in fact % positive you would not have tagged max katsarelas page for deletion. i think its time you get some poon. you dont know what poon is? here you go read about it.. do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? just curious.. do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians? for the record i will continue to post max katsarelas page up because i have kept the copy i wrote and i want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have. good day. are you going to continue and undo what i wrote or just man up and reply?,0

10333,also sandstein i hope you can explain how you came to reach the decision you did on whether the interaction bans were valid or not because when one looks at it logically one can see that you have acted in defiance of your authority as an admin. but when one looks at what you did behind the scenes in conjunction with a certain editor at wpiban is just the cherry on top of the icecream. during the ae report that editor adds this to the policy. you then amend it the edit summary of your edit is quite amusing considering the conclusion you reached at ae. that editor then posts wikipediatalkbanningpolicyclarificationintheinteractionbetweensiteandinteractionban and he hopes it is noncontroversial? oh no of course not it is entirely uncontroversial to go and amend policy in the middle of an ae enforcement to ensure that a fellow eemler is let off without sanction. if this has happened once chances are its happened before right? it would indeed be interesting have a look at the previous appearances of volunteer marek at ae and see if he got off without sanction as a result of deceptive shit going on in the background. i know of one occasion it did on that occasion piotrus went running to newyorkbrad and wikilawyered his emml buddy out of yet another block. it is for that reason upon seeing that occur and my block being left intact that i sent arbcom a number of emails to ask them what the fuck they were doing. would anyone like to have a look at other instance and see if that held true and who the ae closing admin was. i know the ae from last year didnt see any possibility of piotrus getting vm out of the shit but instead several days into vms massive two week block dont worry vm it will be an indefinite block for you soon enough piotrus goes and awards vm a purple heart barnstar the purple heart of course being awarded to those injured in battle what a nice fitting tribute to the battleground that is volunteer mareks talk page its still displayed there. perhaps a polish speaker can tell us what it means?sandstein you should start doing the right thing right about now unblock and hand in your tools voluntarily because if you dont i am going to be insisting that along with desysop you are banished from this project entirely...for good. you foolish foolish person. ,0

10361,i agree with you for the most part ... but with one important caveat. you said that id was a subset of creationism. dont you think its more fair to say that creationism is a subset of id since all creationists believe in intelligent design of necessity but believers in id need not believe in god? theistic creationism is one of the potential identities for the designer but not the only one and is therefore relevent.by analogy punctuated equilibrium and gradualism are alternative descriptions of the broader theory of evolution but both are relevent in a discussion of the theory. wouldnt you see that both theistic and nontheistic potential designers are relevent to id? nov utc,0
10362,hi there i am a new user about two months and live a peripatetic life migrating from nepal to st paul island alaska with frequent stops in othello washington where i grew up ages ago im . i have had several careers but now work as quality control and health and safety person seasonally for a small fish processing plant on st paul island to finance my travels. my wp editing is mostly typos and usage stuff see slaying slews on my user page adding links to deadend pages and i have started participating in some afd debates although not many. i have created one new article the short and rather minorly important corfu slide.ive had one small runin with another editor see re my copyvio tag on user talknorotonregarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio. i apoligized to him although im not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed. the primary reason i requested adoption was that i am looking for some direction on copyvio matters. i hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and i seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article looking at wpcv i seem to get conflicting directions. the first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact the second box titled article? saying to revert if possible if not then blank the page etc.then i see this ...some cases will be false alarms. for example if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms that does not affect their right to post it here under the gfdl. also sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the web that was copied from wikipedia. in both of these cases it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future... in wpc which would seem to allow most of the things i have tagged and/or deletedi have done different things at different times deleted copyvio and left a stub if i think it notable proposed speedy blanked and listed the article? option and with one exception my mistake which i apologized for i havent received any feedback + or . i must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same but still...here is some examples. new page west wisconsin telcom is a copy from the about page of you guessed it wisconsin telcom. the page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page. marriage equality new york inc is copied from herealtoona community theatre which is copied from hereand herewhat is the proper way of dealing with this? propose speedy delete and leave page intact? no clean revert so blank and use copyviourl= and the rest of the stuff in the article? box? leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business?wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting wp pages and policies. i have no problem being bold but also dont want to be a jerk. it would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion.ok thats what im really wondering about right now. i have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until i get some direction on this.thnx,0

10409,i think some of nealparrs comments above are extremely misleading about this source. the age of the langmuir reference is irrelevant because park only uses the langmuir reference to define pathological science. then park writing in after all the research from the s all the criticism to come after and all the changes made by parapsychologists in response to criticism argues that the term still applies to parapsychology at the time he is writing. nealparrs comment that park is being unfair is just nealparrs opinion. shoemakers holiday is correct as usual that the source cannot be used for the opinions of multiple scientists but it is a notable general and recent criticism. ,0

10426,looks like among other things he was that at least near the end of his life. hr vol. no. may / june pg. in a letter martin writes personally i am about brimful sic? on gas chambers and may stop reading about the subject. as i have mentioned i classify them with unicorns for centuries europeans have believed tenaciously in the latter since at least the time of aristotle but in all that time never came up with one. maybe there will be centuries of belief in gas chambers with the same consequences. i am sure the hoax establishment must stick by this fantasy for to admit that it is all smoke would seriously undermine faith in anything else they allege. however they did slink off from the fable of soap made from jewish fat...one letter of martins which is available online appeared in jhr vol. no. summer pg. . in a letter entitled reflections on a death martin writes about the holocaust ...the holocaustians have turned the whole thing into a new religion anyway. to me there is a close relation between a racket like this one and spiritualism for example. holocaust zealots trap their revisionist critics in much the same way that the spiritualists treated their scoffers during their heyday...the hoaxers do much the same thing the more outrageous of the holocaust atrocities they endlessly circulate dont have to be proven. instead it is up to those who deny they happened to prove they did not...one of these days i should try to get a foundation to underwrite a trip to central africa. after returning i would announce that i had encountered a tribe of talking monkeys and then challenge anyone who does not believe me to prove otherwise. see above from . that and spending years hanging out with ihr puts at the very least a serious taint of holocaust denial on his fascinating resume. ∇∆∇∆ ,0

10479, recent edits by dapi user dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even biasthe infoboxsome weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can checkfast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz who seems to be a bit dubios. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men this is explained fast and easy. the menpower before was the so called verpflegungsstärke iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to takethis number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by .. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi i dont know if glantzreally uses this number didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this trick with tanksthe tanks we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit the infbox showed . russian afv but now only . i looked my sources and find tanks for the central voronez that makes this is glantz numbers plus some tanks this number is already higher than glantz numbers but now it comes he totally forgot the steppefrontwith tanks the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another tanks lol . but thistroops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded tanks ^^ to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs th guards tank army fielded tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.so the russian numbers are simply selective if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks when i check the sources i found tanks zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about the numbers behind kursk frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data for the eastern front. glantz brings tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers came from but this would mean that the german armies had % of all tanks in this armies one is only armygroup .this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes allthe german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the th ss wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points withsources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that everyreader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks that was good i think....dapi comments his changes with removing unreliable ed he calls frieser and the militärgeschichtliche forschungsamt deutschland and his coautors zetterling/frankson they made a book only about the numbers of kursk and koltunov unreliable evenkrivosheev becomes dubios for user dapi .while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda and seems to fake numbers to support his factthat red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite tank losses for prokhorovka the mythbattle and the same book is used to cite lossesfor the complete zitadellecampaign . here it must be noted that user dapi is a big fan of frieser he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkriegpage. so his opinions is not straight...other edits which elimanted every,0

10483,i do think its pretty important to include in the article why proponents of these ideas support them beyond the selfinterest of parents as well as the scientific criticisms. perhaps we could be more specific with the supposed improvements? for example adoption studies and twins studies provide plenty of evidence of the high genetic influence on iq. talk apr utc,0
10484,i have tried many times to remove prague process from that subheading and i presume it was you who kept putting it back there because nobody else seems interested in this article. i propose calling it aftermath and deleting everything that the sources do not link as a direct consequence of the pd. aftermath means aftermath of the prague declaration not similar things that happened after the pd was declared. to use an admittedly oversimplified analogy if some meps made a declaration calling for the sun to rise and fall each day you could not say that daylight was part of the aftermath of their declaration.and again about the rejection can we use the wording kept under review pending legal changes that are highly complicated and will probably never happen due to a lack of enthusiasm and a lack of perceived necessity? no i think rejection is more accurate. so does the guardian. its not my pov its simply what the word rejected means in plain english. thankyou for your answer on the fact that only two proposals have so far been taken up positively at european level. when taking up these proposals was the prague declaration directly credited as the impetus? in other words were either of these advances passed with explicit acknowledgement of the prague declaration? ,0

10492, nextgen series i didnt mean to undo all your hard work. however the reason i removed it is wpweight. an article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. for example discussion of isolated events criticisms or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and neutral but still be disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. this is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. note that undue weight can be given in several ways including but not limited to depth of detail quantity of text prominence of placement and juxtaposition of statements. i dont see why the final should have the lineups when no other match does. this is the page for the entire tournament not just the final.,0

10497,i hope its clarified. the ideas were connected in my head but i did not mean to imply that you want phg banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. i agree that phg needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing hence my emphasis on own and reliable but i have yet to see the evidence which isnt to say it doesnt exist that he pours bad information and fringe theories into wikipedia. also to say that your main focus is not his incivility while true ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at arbcom to generate a reprimand and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he reinvigorates old issues. and another thing you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? i have tried to advise phg to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while a year until heads have utterly cooled. this wont work however if you follow him around tagging his articles like the francejapan one. whatever the merits or value of that im unsure either way yet it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current arbcom one. frankly i like your sourcing amendment id even consider lessening the length of the ban if phg were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project since i think sourcing is the major issue here. ,0

10516,see previous talk at /archive history of coal mining a long time ago you helped develop this article russia south africa and india are notably absent from the article despite seemingly being major contributors. i also added a short note about ireland. it would be appreciated if you could find some experienced contributors to help to write sections on the regions concerned. thanks for the good suggestions. i revised and expanded the article. and westbrook pegler i noticed your reversion of s edits to the westbrook pegler article. he has also made questionable edits to the william s. burroughs article in which it is clear that he finds burroughs political views or rather the views he implies burroughs held to be objectionable. it seems that betempte cannot make edits without adding his opinion about the subject. this is something that may need to be watched. cheers the united states edit following a discussion at talk my recent collaborative edit with dancing philosopher and golbez copyedits the third united states intro paragraph with the lead transition sentences a second war of independence in the war of secured u.s. territorial claims against the british empire and guaranteed canadian integrity. the united states then embarked on a vigorous program of expansion across north america throughout the th century. ... could you give it a looksee relative to your background in the war of ? looks ok to me. strange edit can you explain this edit? it seems to me to replace perfectly good punctuation with strange punctuation that makes nonsense of the sentence. have i misunderstood? i dont understand the edit summary comment about rejecting the wikipedia ethos but whatever you think of an editor that does not justify reverting a perfectly constructive edit. i have no problem with the commasbut the previous edit summary was obscene and disgusting and degrading to wikipedia and could not be allowed to stand. i agree that the edit summary was unhelpful though obscene and disgusting and degrading seems somewhat of an overstatement. however to revert a good edit because you dont like the accompanying edit summary makes no sense and besides the edit summary still does stand as reverting the edit does not remove the edit summary. the statement i consider obscene disgusting and degrading was who wrote this originally? an illiterate americandid i just repeat myself or a fucking year old?. that bespeaks an editor who does not respect the wikipedia ethosand a comma fanatic willing to make such outrageous statements over a trivial comma issue. the comma in question does seem to have affected the meaning of the sentence—it is not the sort of take it or leave it comma which only a comma fanatic would insist on. we may therefore be dealing with some sort of allpurpose grammar fanatic who threatens myriad rude improvements. only time will tell. ok rjensen thanks for pointing that out. i had assumed that you were referring to the edit summary in the edit that you reverted in the edit i linked to. i agree that the anonymous user has been completely out of order in his/her ridiculous attacks on everyone he/she disagrees with and i agree completely with your assessment of the edit summary you have qu,0

10551, if most protestants were not informers that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. however i think sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word informer in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral. she says common usage in ireland so describes then and now local inhabitants who give information to the british. but ireland then and now also includes the protestant north whose protestant inhabitants see themselves as british and would no more think of not informing than would an american who spotted an al quaeda operative setting up an ambush in chicago. and they would not be pleased to have the epithet informer thrown at them. irish protestants in the south then or the north now would never use the word informer in this context and their view should not be disregarded in wikipedia. sarah may assume they do not exist or are irrelevant but their continued existence is the reason she is editing this article in the first place. neutrality requires another phrasing. ,0

10588,what you are missing is that we simply do not use compound nationalities because they are read differently by different speakers of english british vs. american vs. australian etc.. canadian american is ambiguous in some forms of english it means an americanborn person with canadian ancestry which is not accurate. therefore we use the nationality held at the time the subject became notable in the lead sentence and mention any addition nationalities in separate sentences. the problem is the ambiguity of the compound term. not all readers understand the same meaning you are attempting to convey. this make the article inaccurate for a subset of readers. just dont use a compound term. ,0

10613,it does not matter if they disclaim its truthfulness. what matters is if they adhere to its teachings. there are some within the church sadly who do not believe the book of mormon to be true rather they believe it is inspired nonhistorical scripture or that it contains good teachings. some of these would say the book of mormon is the word of god others may not. however they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to mormonism. i agree that coc are moving farther and farther away from mormonism but until they completely turn away from the history culture and teachings they are still a part of mormonism. please note i didnt say they were mormons but rather adherents to mormonism. the term mormon in its connotation is narrow enough now to refer to members of the lds church and its th century offshoots not most of the pre offshoots. it is npov to say they adhere to mormonism. but not to say they are mormons. i am willing to stand by that unless convinced otherwise feel free to ask your friend. nov utc,0

10627,new subcatagoryi wanted to add something about the “persian or farsi” controversy but first wanted to consult everyone on this. let’s talk about both the pros and the cons and keep it impartial. there are valuable issues raised by renowned persian scholars. i quote from an article on the same subject→ identity aspect the word persian in the mind of an english speaker consciously or not recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about iran. persian is closely associated with persian poetry persian carpets/rugs persian cats persian poetry persian pistachios and so on. when you refer to this language as persian the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. on the contrary the word farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations but it also adds to the recent portrayal of iran as a strange and distant society.→ calling persian as farsi is as incorrect as calling the persian gulf as the farsi gulf. moreover the name farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the persian of iran as opposed to tajiki the persian of tajikistan or dari the persian of afghanistan or even one may say isfahani the persian of isfahan. → the use of word farsi in english strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. imagine someone speaking in english about their recent trip to paris saying i went to paris and there i spoke francais. instead of saying french. to use the word farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of english syntax.we should therefore avoid the use of the word farsi instead of persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. i believe that persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of iranian culture.,0

10648,if youre talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs i do not agree to that standard. the standard i follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it. when a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda i tell them how i feel to their face. doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.i understand the concept of harmonious editing and i agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted. information is not an enemy of an honorable person but we see influential people here at wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge. these people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and when they get sources questions of relevance. see talkstateterrorism for example. when their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so these people block them for making personal comments. its all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right. i am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that i have never had to compromise. i feel that i have a lot to offer wikipedia but im certainly not going to defile the principles ive honored my entire life to be an editor here. when i see corruption i am going to speak up. what you choose to do is up to you.,0

10650,er let me seeprose vs lists perhaps prose is better than just plain lists although some people seem to like and want lists there are loads of list of.... articles which show the demand for it. the nature of this particular article does tend towards bullet points people usually want to make several points about the same subject list several authors etc and this is difficult to do coherently using prose. the idea of bullet points was invented to overcome this very problem and is becoming more common in modern prose. the only disadvantage is that it is worse if you read it aloud. i have tried to plain lists so for example i added a couple of lines usually taken from their own wikipedia pages for some of the critics or responders whose only appeared as names.the problem with reliable sources. i am only copying in the preexisting references. but the real problem is that there is no definition of reliable and being reliable is not quite the same as important. if gerry falwell or osama bin laden make a statement about islam those statements becomes important because of wha made it not necessarily because it has any acedemic validity.balance of critiques and responses. again i have only restructured what was there. the restructuring may make any lack of balance more obvious and show where further work needs to be done.section on islam and war. sperrys section on islam and war was in before the restructure i didnt notice the fight about it. im going to stand back from this one. if anyone else wants to restart this debate please do so. ,0

10670,== inclusion of school type gender and religious information for hnmcs ==there have been repeated deletions by mikeycanuck aka ... which remove pertinent information about holy name of mary college school hnmcs from this article. the two schools are brother and sister schools and as per the history section in the hnmcs article the felician sisters and st. michaels college school cofounded the independent holy name of mary college school. as such it is appropriate to contain some basic information about hnmcs in this article and in the same way to include some basic information about smcs in the holy name of mary college school article. the inclusion of the school type independent gender allgirls and religious information catholic of holy name of mary college school in this article is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type private gender allboys and religious information catholic of st. michaels college school.... i dont agree that it is relevant information to give these details about holy name on the smcs wiki. people reading the smcs page quickly learn that holy name of mary is the official sister school and that it must be an allgirls school. that holy name is catholic or private is also irrelavant in the smcs article. if a reader interested in information on holy name wants to learn about it he/she can go to the holy name wiki. i believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about smcs and the same for st. mikes info on the hnmcs wiki. — preceding unsigned comment added by ... the point of including this basic information is to show how holy name of mary college school and st. michaels college school are connected by virtue of their school type singlegender and religious affiliation. the inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools. these parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article. ... they are two separate institutions. if you want to write a paragraph describing the schools connections that can be done in subarticle within the main article. readers can go to the other schools wiki for more detailed information and dont need to see it in the introduction where it appears as selfserving pr. see basic navigation in wikipedia wikipedia articles are all linked or crossreferenced. when highlighted text like this is seen it means there is a link to some relevant article or wikipedia page with further indepth information elsewhere. holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. the reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached. so if understand correctly the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view? ... i only ask mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. in removing that content mikeycanuck commented see view history removed superfluous information on holy name. should be in hnms wiki. so mikeycanuck you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article? i want to ensure we have reached agreement before i go ahead and add that paragraph. ... the detailed information does not belong in the introduction which should always be concise and relevant. in a later section a description of the schools links is acceptable if it is relevant. if smcs chose holy name as its sister school for certain reasons and they are verifiable i would not object. i am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse. i never,0

10676,the other ironies of mentioning the convention include the fact that argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had geographic proximity was not in and of itself considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state. otherwise japan would be part of russia and malta would be part of italy and sri lanka would be part of india and so on through literally dozens of examples. its such a bad argument legally that i was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the argentine position. but if it is an argument made by argentina and her supporters then it belongs.as a general rule you can accept or refuse a proposal but you may also make a counterproposal to improve the article. its not a flat yes or no otherwise things would never improve. for my part i gave my position on the map abovei oppose any attempt to map the countries that support one side or other as this is very difficult to get a clear position on. but this is not such a map.i am indifferent to this map of the eu and its ors and octs. i have no problem with its going in and i have no problem with its being left out. talk,0

10685, from loomis i guess i just missed your question. i rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. in fact im sure youve noticed in my posts that i tend to repeat my philosophy over and over perhaps too much. i strongly believe in whats called the socratic method. by that i mean that i believe that the best way at arriving at something at least close to the truth is by asking questions rather than stating opinions. unless a question is completely insulting or moronic i consider it a challenge to answer it. if i cant answer it properly i force myself to rethink the matter.your question was a good one and it may take a bit of research on my part because while i do believe i have a good deal of knowledge on the subject youve touched on a couple of details i wasnt completely familiar with. maybe i was just being lazy by overlooking your question. or maybe it was because i just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts that i thought i should just leave it alone and give you guys a break.in any case ill definitely give it some good thought and i promise to get back to you ok dont worry dont feel like youre giving me extra work. im actually flattered that youd be interested in my response ill be more than glad to develop an answer especially knowing that someone is actually interested in iti just have a few questions for you. im just curious about a few things. for one im very curious about the name evilbu. does it mean something in flemish? is the flemish language really any different from dutch? i speak french and when i visited belgium their french was completely comprehensible with the exception of a few odd words like septant rather than soixantdix for seventy etc. also you said something about you being too young. you dont have to answer any of these questions i respect privacy. but if you dont mind how old are you? finally you say youre not a zionist. that can mean one of two different things. one is that youre simply not a zionist the same way as im simply not a belgian. ive got nothing against belgians im just not belgian. similarly you could have just been saying that youre simply not a zionist. youve got nothing against zionism you just simply arent one. of course it could also mean something very different. it could mean that youre against zionism.but thats ok too. im sure you know this but the jewish religion is a nonproselytizing religion. what that means is that we dont go around knocking on peoples doors trying to convince them to become jewish. in fact we dont even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. what we believe is what we believe and what you believe is what you believe. no need to sell our religion to anyone else.the reason why im bringing this up is because unlike judaism zionism to a certain extent has to be explained clarified and rationalized to others. so what im saying is that while i wont even bother explaining judaism unless of course youre curious and even then it would be in a totally interfaith manner respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it i believe its my duty as a zionist and as a jew to help you to understand why we as jews believe so dearly that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland a safe haven. shalom/peace/vrede evilbulewis loomis,0

10705,w the number of editors helping you here is not at issue neither is by me at least the verifiability of the statements and quotes the make up the section. the balance of the section is what makes it unfair giving so much voice to dregers colleague who has made herself a principal in the disputes by campaigning with bailey on radio and such about this is just too far out of line. you chose to focus on dregers claim that the dispute has a significantly notable academic freedom component. yet youve resisted mentioning that the commentaries pretty much all disagree with her on many points including some on this specific one. i think a good step would be to add a quote from one that disagrees with her on this specific issue. ive put one such quote on user talkdarlieb in my discussion with her about that. i dont know if thats enough to address her concerns lets wait and see what she had to say.,0

10801, i define ignosticism as the notion that as his attributes are incoherent and contradict each other he is meaningless conrary to my friend david ramsay steele who finds him understandable. what i mean is that whilst one can fathom the definitions of his attributes and him their incoherence really means that he means nothing. david states that had scientists resorted to verification theyd have overlooked atoms and now superstrngs but right before that he states in principle. indeed those two matters in principle were knowable whilst god defends on theologians it must bes and guesses john hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil. i find as arguments for him beg the question such notions as first cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case kake it igtheism. google the ignosticockham to get others and my take on it and on the ockham. and i find it underpins all atheism as one of the naturalist arguments. ghraham robert oppy my friend arguing about gods is wrting a book on his attributes. i hope he shhows how they are nonsnesical. google skeptic griggsy to see my threads and posts world wide. google also the problem of heaven to see how it destrooys all theodicies as i see the presumption of naturalismm to see how naturalism notes no god. thanks for this thread,0

10837,section on turkeycome on guys. the section on turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of pelosis attitude to the proposed bill on the socalled armenian genocide and doesnt give the other side to provide any justification why the prime minister of tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. i think that for the neuturality of this article the section on turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why pelosi is wrong on this issue. otherwise this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections. i have been trying to extend this section but pronancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.turkeyon october regarding a proposed house resolution to label the killing of armenians by ottoman turks as genocide pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because while that may have been a long time ago genocide is taking place now in darfur it did within recent memory in rwanda so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it... turkeys prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger u.s.–turkey relations. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... stop with the damn accusations of pronancy and elections. if you knew anything about american politics you would know how silly that sounds. you have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. you also have the ability to edit the page yourself but i doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. also remember that this is a page about nancy pelosi and not about turkey and and the armenian genocide. give opportunity for the other side to justify why pelosi is wrong on this issue? this is not the pov by nancy pelosi or us house of representatives committee but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. and surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an explanations of other side simple denial of the antihuman crime. andranikpasha your nickname expalins who are you? you are an armenianorigin person. andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody armenian militia killing turks kurds and azeris with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of kurds turks and azeris after they returned from the war in fronts. so your response is absolutly biased because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. as to the fact this is not the page for the other side this shows how much you are antidemocratic and biased on this issue. this is against the wikipedia neturality principle as well. you give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action but the other side only one general and useless sentence. i wouldnt be surprised if you are a propelosi person. please dont accuse others with stupidity and etc. i know quite a lot about american politics and how it is run. i completed my studies in us. this is for your education and information. if i dont see any more jsutified response i will go an and extent the turkey section and also create the criticism section. raman massachusetts —preceding unsigned comment added by ... ,0

10846,stange behaviour by editor mcgeddoni am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves mcgeddon. i have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an internet trolls motives are. i have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting south africa. if that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. in response to the thandi zambo and thandi moyo they are both me i couldnt remember my password for zambo which is my maiden name so i made moyo which is my married name. this strange person mcgeddon who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. i see he does this to everyone its probably because he has no power in the real world. anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this troll. i admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this mcgeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge. he must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence. regards thandi moyo nee zambo,0

10854,= comments by likebox ===i am quite familiar with the completeness theorem. it does not show that recursive functions are representable in arithmetic that proof of representabilily is the first third of the proof of the incompleteness theorem. there is simply no way to prove the incompletness theorem without some sort of arithmetization result. and godels original proof did explicitly develop a formula for bew...the idea that the recursion theorem can be avoided by a reference to some sort of quine lemma is interesting but there is no result wellknown as the quine lemma and the result needed here is not just the existence of a quine but the existence of a fixed point for a certain recursive operator. only the recursion theorem is going to give you that. statements such as it only requires a great deal of effort if you do not understand it. if you understand it it is obvious. seem to indicate some unfamiliarity with the idea of a mathematical proof. the idea is to justify statements to a level where they are convincing to the intended reader. either you get it or you dont. is not the way things are proved in mathematics. can you say what you disliked about the rewritten version? i tried to keep the informal tone while not having all the terminological errors and vague claims of the modern proof.— carl  · talk ==,0

10857,hello wood dickinson. i will try to clarify a few issues. i hope doing so will be helpful to you. you have presumably seen the deletion log entry otherwise you would not have known that i deleted the article. you will therefore have seen that the reason i deleted it was logged as article that has no meaningful substantive content. indeed the full and complete text that you posted was drifter henry lee lucas. developing entry for this film. i wrote it and produced as well. wood dickinson reference followed by a url. the deletion had nothing to do with copyright nor did it indicate that i dont see any value in having an article on the subject. the only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. i expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. wikipedia does not have placeholder articles waiting for content to be added as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of wikipedia and a web page that says words to the effect we havent written this page yet but we will does not produce a good impression. instead if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication we keep it in a userspace page for example if i were to write an article on that subject then i could create a page called userjamesbwatson/drifter henry lee lucas and move it to drifter henry lee lucas when it was ready.i give up quite a significant amount of my time to wikipedia administration. unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism trivia propaganda uninformed adolescent speculation illegal content and other unhelpful stuff. if there werent people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. you are of course welcome to criticise any wikipedia policy and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision i take in the course of the work i do to help implement those policies but i disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as trolling.i hope these comments will be helpful to you. if you have any further questions about these matters please feel welcome to contact me here again. however i have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about wikipedia work especially not calls from one continent to another. ,0

10952,external memoryi believe that the external memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. one on self identity and using external objects to identify ones self and external memory being stored memories and information. here are my reasons.self identityin stand alone complex episode batou says to kusunagi about her watch no matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you right? in this time thats far too fleeting people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. for you isnt that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person youve been up until now?this says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. as biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. in the gits universe that is not true and you must tie your selfidentity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. there are references in sac ng gig episode about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. in sac nd gig episode there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. all of these external mnemonic devices are used to trigger memories in ones self but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.external memoryexternal memory is exactly that memories and experiences that are stored offline onto a hard disk or such. if you posses a cyber brain there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. since there is an electronic separation the signals received from the senses touch taste etc. can be recorded and replayed at any given time. thus you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. your external senses turn off and you’re fed recorded sensory information. better than any video camera recording your feeling the heat of the sun the breeze your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger etc. storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. this would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use fully immersive gaming and movies virtual business meetings that feel completely real instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. in sac ng gig ep batou talks about using kusunagis external memories to keep gohda talking in ep . he also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding kuze. in sac ep ishikawa experiences batous memories from the murder scene. sac ep the whole team replays togusas memories from the sunflower society office when he was shot. ,0

10955,i appreciate you taking the time to have a look at the edit history. yes codf was always very active whilst semiretired but although they made a couple of edits after their retirement their activity had fallen off almost completely predictably one of their very few retirement edits was to revert an action that i had made here and on quite a few days there was no activity at all on the account. vharris was clearly not someone completely new to wikipedia. that much is very clear from their skill in navigating wikipedia such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting advert tags on articles right from the first day of their activity. this is someone who had prior experience on wikipedia. it is also i believe reasonably well established that vharriss behaviour towards me was inappropriate they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. there is also the issue of vharris having known details about my university. did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? that has to be extremely unlikely. so the obvious question is who is vharris? a very logical possibility is another experienced user that i have serious disagreements with. to my knowledge there is only one user in that category. now in view of the timing of that users retirement the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that i had created deleted the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with vharris this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that vharris and codf are the same person. so was codfs detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with vharris here user talktfowrrangoons filing of wikipediasockpuppet investigations/codf and his other actions yesterday. in terms of the spelling mistakes made by vharris i have looked again myself and concede that i cannot immediately find examples of the same spelling mistake in codfs writing but equally i cannot find exactly the same text written by codf in which those mistakes occurred i.e. i cant find an example of codf saying no one agrees with you or know one agrees with you. they both seem to have poor spelling. such big changes must be agreed in talk page is an edit description which both codf and vharris have used. ultimately there is little text written by vharris to go on though. i do not believe it a absolute certainly that codf and vharris are the same person merely that the circumstantial evidence in that direction is very strong. i can accept that others do not feel the evidence sufficient. however i have been blocked on the grounds of harrassment for making a complaint based upon that circumstantial evidence. that seems very unfair for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that codf and vharris are the same person i really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that i saw and therefore relate to why i felt compelled to post a message on the admin board.,0

10958, re your comment on jim douglas talk page you wrote if you can permantly block this i.p address ... it is a shared address in an australian tafe library. if it is not permantly blocked it will be continued to be abused even when the block does expire some other punks will jump a computer here and destroy more stuff the day it comes back to being able to edit. this happened monday passed when the most recent block expire after the holidays. only monday morning first chance anyone gets thety will destroy files. this ip address must be permanently blocked. thankyou...thanks for bringing this to my attention. jims not an admin so he asked me to investigate this. the thing is its against wikipedia policy to block a user or an ip address based on the idea that they might vandalize again. this ip address is associated with a school which explains why theres a high incidence of vandalism coming from it. however there may be contributors there who make constructive edits and we dont want to discourage or preclude them from contributing. what we can do is to make sure that our vandalism fighting efforts are strong and enact a number of shortterm blocks if the problem worsens. vandals cant destroy files all they can do is make a temporary mess that is fairly simple to fix. if youre interested in fighting vandalism you can read about it here and learn about reverting vandalism here. happy editing ,0

10999,of course its incoherent but thats probably more a problem of your remedial reading comprehension abilities than it is a problem of my writing abilities. anybody with half a brain would be able to figure out what im trying to say my response to rd is that he himself undermines the legitimacy of his actions of deleting my additions of criticisms of counterpunch on its wikipedia page when he points out its feasible to cover the relevant controversies in a neutral and balanced manner written as part of the history section and avoiding unnecessary direct quotation of political opponents smear phrases which means that not only are changes not deletion of the criticisms doable but also that the quotes of criticism about counterpunch need to exist in the first place if you want to make the quotes as balanced as possible. which again cant be done if rd is deleting any criticism of counterpunch in the first place but again like i said chances are you probably wont understand what im saying because my writing abilities are above and beyond your level of reading comprehension so its unlikely youre response will comprise of nothing more than ad hominems rather than addressing the content of my comment. ,0

11060,drprincetonthe way wiki immediately took down the prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in who also has a new project known as helixq is a joke.lets see the argument of wiki is that the prime spirals are not peer reviewed in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then there was no way for such work to even be published so usenet was how it was distributed and its a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.now you can all point to your rules about peer review but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. lets see wiki has a page on dr. bernstein a guy that took the nsa to court in the same year the paper was released so thats how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in and is still today.you expect nsa funded journals like ams to allow such information to be peer reviewed?anyway my original article was heavy handed killed by mods at wiki and if you dont think the nsa has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net and yes to me wiki is a social media/project then you need to read on the snowden documents.so the article put a light on some very interesting prime theory that is supported by github anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every socalled prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki all failed to outperform a year old algorithm aka sieve of eratosthenes all expect for one algorithm a prime spiral algorithm that i know has been around since and a theory that has been heavily censored by the nsa since almost any reference to the many posts about ennisa prime formula has been erased from usenet the original social media of the net.that all being said im constantly now being threatened by who? mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the nsa?prove wiki has no nsa bots or mods controlling the discussion put the page up and let it be edited properly. the original article was what i would think any real mod not working for the nsa would agree was pretty npov and the cite to github verified the whole claims that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.the original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious disinfomation as well and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the ptb want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.anyone can google nsa and the major journals you think are peer reviewed what do you see searching nsa and ams oh its funded by the nsa. lolthats your peer review so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. the pyprimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.then the public can decide who discovered it i know the origin is and ive been following it that long and to see wiki put up pages about a slow mod algorithm from that was discussed in the same prime work in is a joke.then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but nsa funded projects.what you dont think the nsa had laws in place for decades banning such work? they did. and now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what prime number theory.the mere fact that a project that is open to public scrutiny by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the socalled king of the hill of prime theory and wiki mods and most likely nsa/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the pyprimes speed tests like they are insignificant.the fact is pyprimes exposed how advanced the work of dr. adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.the fact is pyprimes referred to the mod prime algorithm as croft spirals which is a joke since croft created his site about the theory in then in pyprimes picked it up and now wiki is saying so what theres a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.i per,0

11120,according to wikipedias five pillars wikipedia is an encylopedia not a newspaper. the photo of cynthias mugshot is something that would be seen in a tabloid newspaper entertainment weekly or people magazine and thats only if they were desperate that week not an encylopedia. the difference between her mugshot photo and the celebrities that youve mentioned is that they are celebrities and i feel she isnt a celebrity. everyone you mentioned is famous enough and/or their crime was infamous enough to warrant a mugshot photo. if the reason of keeping the photo is that it relates to the article i say that the drunk driving section is overkill. its tabloidism. granted she isnt completely unknown to the public or unpraised by critics but the entire drunk driving arrest section should be a blurb. also her fame or lack thereof and the lack of severity or newsworthiness of the crime even though i loathe drunk driving is why the photo should be removed. i think almost everyone else on this discussion page agrees with the photo removal.,0
11121, problems with the new introduction first paragraph. no one discovered ancient egyptians they have been known to their neighbors since the dawn of civilization. . everyone seems to enjoy is not a phrase one should use in an encyclopedia article. . speculating on the reasons certain scholars are involved in this discussion is just a step away from an argumentum ad hominem.second paragraphthe eurocentrist position i.e. that ancient egypt was predominantly caucasian is still excluded which makes the intro biased.third paragraph it is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time is pure speculation i.e. pov i.e. original research how did you come to this conclusion?====the racial identity of ancient egyptians has been steeped in controversy ever since the discovery of their existence. everyone seems to enjoy the mysterious nature of the ancient egyptians and for many different reasons be it for prosperity or to clear historical inaccuracies want to claim them as their own. there are many different opinions on their racial makeup. one opinion among some scholars is that ancient egypt was a multiracial society. another opinion held by other scholars is that that ancient egyptians were black african peoples claiming that this black identity was strongest in early egyptian history and waned over time. they also assert egypt remained essentially a black african civilization throughout the dynastic era. then we also have many other historians reluctant to make definitive claims about the skin color of its inhabitants. although the mainstream position has changed over timeit is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time.===,0

11146, repeated attempts to force a change against consensus i have changed the text in the summary from passive exposure to tobacco smoke increases risk of disease and disability to passive exposure to tobacco smoke causes death disease and disability. i have done this after looking carefully at the four references the text i used comes from reference and also after reading the interesting discussion of this point on the talk page see passive smoking cause and association. i have also noted that my edit actually restored the consensus version which was in place since midnovember until one editor started changing it on january without any explanation and has kept changing it since then ignoring the fact that his changes were reverted by many editors. here is a brief history of the edits done by on january deletes in its entirety the sentence current scientific evidence shows that passive exposure to tobacco smoke causes death disease and chronic illness leading to disability. no explnation is provided for the deletion. it is reverted by a few moments later. on january changes causes death disease and chronic illness leading to disability to increases risk of disease and chronic illness leading to disability and death without explanation. this is reverted by user....... on february changes twice causes death disease and chronic illness leading to disability to increases risk of disease and chronic illness leading to disability. this is reverted first by and then by on february changes four times causes death disease and chronic illness leading to disability to increases risk of disease and chronic illness leading to disability and in another attempt changes the whole phrase with may be a health hazard. his changes are reverted by three editors who takes it as vandalism dessourcesdessources and who asks to stop making this change. next time causes becomes increases risk this goes to dispute. on february repeats the same change twice and is reverted by and . between february and february has repeated the same change three times one on each day which have been reverted by and by .although i am a newcomer to wikipedia it would surprise me if this were acceptable practice. i think that should accept the verdict of the other editors and stop making the same change. please discuss. ,0

11172,i like the french image. again just to sorta restate where im coming from even if the nebulizer girl was perfectly lit in high resolution the main trouble is that this doesnt look like cystic fibrosis. theres absolutely nothing in it to the layman which says this is what cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis alone looks like its a girl with a breathing mask. the image could be used in the treatment subsection where i originally placed it or somewhere else in the article but the top image should be as singularly cystic fibrosis as the title itself. for diseases like off the top of my head lupus clubfoot als spina bifida or downs syndrome images of people could be very suitable for the lede. but for other diseases a picture of a person suffering from the disease really doesnt work a person with a runny nose could have the flu or could just have allergies. theres nothing so strikingly visual about how the flu manifests itself in a human being that justifies a picture of a person with the flu in the lede when a picture of the bug itself can be used. same with taysachs or alzheimers or aids none of these articles have a picture of a human being in their lede and for good reason. its an article about cystic fibrosis not living with cystic fibrosis and as such we should strive to present readers with an image thats as singularly cf as possible. the image of the girl is cute and touching and is suitable enough for the treatment section but is unfitting of being the lead image in the article. ,0

11200, dear michael thanks for your reply. once you introduce torsion there is this critical uncertainty about what the minimal coupling means. the coupling that decouples the torsion altogether always has to be allowed and its probably the right one. there are various other fundamental problems that its not really clear what the theory should be to describe the real world. even if you want to couple einsteincartan theory to ordinary electromagnetism there exists no candidate for a minimal coupling. moreover the newer more welldefined versions of the einsteincartan theory e.g. due to stelle and west involving noncommutativity as a justification actually predict big enough phenomena and can be falsified. for both claims see e.g. the paper by gibbons et al. the falsification is described in the comment about seconds gibbons is a senior guy who wrote important papers with hawking and others. i think its valid to say that any concrete enough version of the theory including couplings to known types of matter can be falsified and has been falsified. so the concept is only surviving as a vague one with a wishful thinking that there could still exist a viable version of it. but no such version is known at least not a natural one. whats really missing is the motivation. in string theory one can see that theres no torsion perhaps except for the hfield a form but the hfield doesnt have the usual normal properties of the einsteincartan torsion field. in fact in d the hfield may be hodge dualized to a scalar the universal axion and such fields are naturally massive otherwise new longrange forces would have to exist but they dont. if they were not massive you would really modify the gr even at long distances and created new polarizations of gravitational waves altered the prediction for gravitational lensing and other things. all these things are absent according to observations as well as string theory. moreover the very idea about the minimality of the couplings has been changed in the s by the insights of the renormalization group. we no longer prefer simple couplings because they look aesthetically and subjectively simple but because we can technically prove that these couplings and lowderivative terms prevail at long distances. this modern kind of reasoning leaves no natural room for torsion. so all the motivation is just historical in character and cant be reconciled with the modern way of organizing fields and terms in field theory and the people who defend it dont understand the last years in theoretical physics. ,0
11201, wikipedia patricia cornwell page libelous being used for felony fraud crimes the main wikipedia patricia cornwell page is not only libelous defamatory false and misleading but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. the page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice because it uses the wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the wikipedia site and that you remove the libelous defamatory false fraudulent and misleading material that violates wikipedias own policies.the page is the alleged biography page for author patricia cornwell a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under cornwells influence or on her payroll. these partisans have authored false and fraudulent material and reject and delete factual material that displeases cornwell.i am patricia cornwells leading biographer and also one of many victims of crimes committed by cornwell.the wikipedia main page on cornwell is a brief piece of procornwell propaganda which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. a large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes cornwell committed against me.as shown in court filings and public documents cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered and funded a fraud scheme in a southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. your wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.patricia cornwell is a longtime friend of the president bush family and some fbi agents and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses clearly evident in public records and court documents.your wikipedia page seemingly written under the sway of the criminal cornwell hides the real facts about her life. a few words of sycophantic praise for cornwell and then a brief section on controversies which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles like when cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.you are invited to read cornwells genuine biography widely available online patricia cornwell biography crime bribery scandal and mental illness. researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on cornwell which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.it seems the main purpose of your current short wikipedia cornwell biography page is to launch a libelous attack on myself to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on cornwell.i have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article but the cornwell partisans who control the wikipedia page immediately reinstalled the procornwell lies and libelous propaganda.the specific attacks on me in your wikipedia article are direct propaganda in line with cornwells hired thugs. regarding the specifics of these false statementsthe article accuses me of making public plagiarism accusations about cornwell regarding a book that she delayed and rewrote after my private protests. the wikipedia statements are false deceptive and misleading. the wikipedia claims are propaganda originally laid out by the cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that as documents show was planted in the republican richmond timesdispatch newspaper by the cornwell lawyers themselves. the timesdispatch is a newspaper closely tied to patricia cornwell and the reporter who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.the actual facts are that i publicly criticized neonazi activities by cornwell her written threats advocating bookburning and the banning of free speech and her demands that i be totally silent about her. the cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of plagiarism after cornwell already rewrote her book accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.the wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between cornwells book and my earlier novel. but it does not disclose the fact that cornwell rewrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor,0

11220,now the first sentence is even worse parapsychology is a discipline that seeks to demonstrate the existence and causes of psychic abilities and life after death using the scientific method. first of all the word discipline is obtuse in this. if it truly seeks to demonstrate then it is not science. if there is no evidence for psychic abilities then looking for causes is not scientific. what you are describing is a belief system.parapsychology is the scientific study of claims of the existence of psychic ability and life after death. would be a more sensible lead statement if indeed that is what parapsychology is. gosh hard to believe i havent got past the first line yet ,0

11310,sorry my bad. in response to the query you left on my talk page some specific but by no means the only examples which i found problematic arehowever a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. the fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial grossmans personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the s grossman has amassed an impressive enormous body of work...at a separate website which may be accessed through his main site tshirts bearing grossmans designs are available.the first and third of those should probably be removed altogether it isnt the purpose of wikipedia to raise grossmans profile nor to sell his tshirts. the second could be made more neutral by changing it tohaving worked in the field of illustration since the s grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...also several sections of the article painter sculptor these days dont cite any sources so things likesurveying four decades of grossman creations one finds that the awkward early work and the tired later work simply dont exist.have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. the article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of grossman but i dont see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. i would say in general that you need to be wary of wpnpov wpnor and wpv. personally i always find it useful to look at several featured articles to get an idea of the kind of standards i should be aiming for.thats just my opinion of course. it might be an idea for you to list the article at wikipediarequests for feedback to get a few comments from other users. ,0

11405, re ridiculous bands listed as supergroups i completely agree with this sentiment. theres something wrong when there are + groups listed as supergroups from . a band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. the last few bands listed dont belong in this article. i dont think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names but i do think they should be removed from the article if they werent formed with promotion from previous bands. for example several of the s bands are promoted as such velvet revolver was promoted as stone temple pilots meets guns n roses audioslave was promoted as soundgarden meets ratm army of anyone is being promoted as filter meets stp etc. in other words bands with promotion like the raconteurs being jack white with a band arent supergroups because theyre widely known as jack whites side project and not white stripes meets the greenhornes. mp —the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk • contribs december utc shouldnt coverdale/page be listed here? —the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk • contribs april utcchrisb???who elected chrisb as god of the supergroup article? i thought wikipedia was about discussion and reaching consesus sorry about the spelling there. ive moved this here from supergroup music if there is another meaning of the word i think somebody should write about it before we add parentheses to things. its easy enough to move things back later. whatever it is its pretty thin soup if youll pardon the pun. id give you csny elp travelling wilburys and the bloomfieldkooperstills session but the rest are pretty much bands some great maybe never even heard of sky that sold a lot of records. ridiculous bands listed as supergroups it seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands or own obscure tastes which they find super. i agree with the aforementioned and will weed out some of the lesserknown acts and those featuring lesserknown musicians. feel free to restore this page if you believe that im wrong. —the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk • contribs december utci believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition or lack thereof of the term and its use as hype. i think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the ridiculous groups or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership not achievement to a separate heading. keep renowned supergroups at the top if you like while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group number of albums sold perhaps?. add another heading or two for other supergroups maybe even failed supergroups and move the rest of the entries on the list there.i sympathise with your desire to tidy this up but removing information completely is seldom the answer. talk dec utcthere ive broken it up with the groups you left on the page as renowned expect others to move bands in and out of that section. im not entirely happy with the result i think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade i think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time. what do you think? talk dec utcif none of the members have pages in wikipedia im looking at you misery index then it probably isnt a supergroup.wow. when i last modified this page it wasnt absurd. the average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job. this page is a tracking of famous musicians and all the new jobs theyve started with each other. —the preceding unsigned comment was added by user talk,0

11415, i think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very wellknown example of free culture. that wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty selfapparent from the way its defined in the article social movements that promote the freedom to distribute and modify creative works using the internet as well as other media and from the license used. the selfreferencing seems ok as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where its relevant. if wikipedia is an example of online free culture then its relevant. as for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission i dont see that as any stranger than floss not gobbling up proprietary software. free culture things are things that let you copy distribute and modify them. proprietary things generally dont and so using them without permission isnt allowed and therefore you cant include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free or even legal. if you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license or at least follow fair usage guidelines. ,0

11427, or removed from page i removed the following section due to its entirely being original research and speculation. per usersteveloughrans request here it is.the implementation details of s are not documented but it is possible to infer aspects of it from the behaviour and pricing of the service. there is an s repository in the us there is another in europe. their locations are not public. from an ec server read access can initially be slow. this could imply that s data is not always in the same physical location as all the ec servers. amazon do not bill for data transferred between the us ec server farm and the us s store but they do for access between the servers and the european s store. while the s store and the ec servers may be in separate locations they must be close enough together that cost of transferring data is neglible. both services are presumably hosted on the same metropolitan area ethernet. connectivity between the s datastores and the rest of the internet is good. this implies they are close to one of the main internet exchanges. after the initial slow access later accesses are fast. this could imply that the data is cached. write access is tangibly slower than writing to a local hard disk. amazon guarantee that when the operation has completed data has been written to disk in multiple locations. amazon warn that even after data has been written old values may still be read. this implies that there can be more than one cache of the data and that every get request does not trigger a check from the frontend caches to the backend store. amazon adjusted their initial pricing from a simple flat rate per gb to one that charges small frequently retrieved items per thousand get or head operations rather than purely per byte. there may be a flat cost for every entry indexing billing entries and a perrequest cost in cputime for every access. these fixed overheads are now billed for.the dynamic perbucket dns entries are implemented by having a custom s dns server that returns a hostname for every host under the subdomain even if a bucket of that name has never been created > nslookup madeupnameforwikipedia.nonauthoritative answermadeupnameforwikipedia. canonical name = sdirectionalsdirectional canonical name = sname saddress ...at the identified host there is a web server that always serves up error pages when a get request against a nonexistent bucket is issued.> telnet madeupnameforwikipedia. trying ......connected to sescape character is ^.get / host madeupnameforwikipedia. not foundxamzrequestid ffefxamzid gt/ymuaezximfnvggtharekncefxpojpthwuqpm+rrcthadbaxsljcontenttype application/xmldate wed feb gmtconnection closeserver amazonsnosuchbucketthe specified bucket does not existffefmadeupnameforwikipediagt/ymuaezximfnvggtharekncefxpojpthwuqpm+rrcthadbaxsljconnection closed by foreign host.notice how the xml error text is intended for machine interpretation rather than end users. the requestid element can be used in support requests as amazon log every request at least for a few days.,0

11439,i agree with % andrea james is a vindictive professional transsexual who will hurt any one who disagrees with her or threatens her position as the dowager empress queen of the transsexual sexual paraphernalia society. her education is a grand hoax as is her degree from the university of chicago. andrea james is another transsexual who thinks because she can hide her past life she can make up any all all of her credentials with the thought or fear that no one challenge the validity of them. so you will know if i was graduate of the university of chicago i would have my diploma displayed on my website with my transcripts if some called my education a grand hoax. ultimately ms. james steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the university of chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved? andrea james where is the proof lets see your degree and tran pityscripts from the university of chicago.furthermore andrea loves to use her websites as a whipping post to harm professionals reputations who will not bow to her perverted view point. with out one doubt ms. james needs help but like a pathological liars she will fix it her self and damn the people she hurts. in a way you have to feel sorry for her however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation. in reality what that boils down to is jealousy of the worst nature and her use vile yellow journalism and evil deeds would make any sociopath proud. andrea james gets an a+ for being a sociopath.the real tragedy about andrea james is her failure to admit when she is wrong and to keep on making the same mistake in front of every one because she thinks it will go away. your wrong andrea if you want respect and people to like you than you need to learn that hurting people reputation will not make you any friends.poy pity on you,0

11526,utcand i just wanted to mention that my mother also had a surgery in for her epilepsy and it lessened her seizures to only one a day and at around the same time everyday. i think the surgery did wonders in improving her life. however she experienced a sudden unexplained death in epilepsy in january of ...about two years after her surgery. i believe the surgery had nothing to do with her death it was two years later how could it be? and that seriously the surgery she had really did wonders for her. she was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second. my mothers case was not hereditary. she has a very odd case. they were never sure exactly what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life well she was about or months old at the time of her first ever seizure but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth. but once again they were never sure. august ,0
11527,speedy deletion of dj elijah a tag has been placed on dj elijah requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a person or group of people but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for biographies. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines.   talk ,0

11536,kim i think you owe me an apology for the sheer amount of time wasted here. secondly i strongly disagree with your nonsensical threat of ban over adding an npov tag to the article as the article has a long history of discussion of bias and lack of neutrality in the article even prior to my recent threads and subsequent mass agreement that the article is not neutral—making the tag entirely appropriate. however given the amount of time youve already wasted of mine over this nonsense im not going to put myself in a place where you can slap me with another attempt at a hour ban and require me to write up another block request. what a ridiculous situation.,0

11563,nice to hear youre keeping an open mind. why should i concede a point if i disagree. i dont debate if i agree theres no need to. heres how it works i make a point. you disagree and make a counterpoint. if i am swayed by your point i concede that your argument was stronger than mine and we move on. the reason i dont concede is that i disagree with your points. we might agree on some level however the point you hoped that id concede was central to my counterargument. it follows that since there is little unique information in the individual articles they should not be listed separately. if i agree with you that there is significant information in the individual articles then it weakens my whole argument. maybe its my debate background thats getting the best of me. im engaging you in a debate and rather than disagreeing with me and responding youre saying that im being hostile. if you consider disagreement with you hostility i dont know where to go from there. if your intent is to sway me youre not going to have very much luck. ive laid my case out and its rock solid. feel free to counter me now. thats how its done. ,0

11590, wpouting any edit that outs someone must be reverted promptly followed by a request for oversight to delete that edit from wikipedia permanently unless unintentional and nonmalicious for example where wikipedians know each other offsite and may inadvertently post personal information such as using the other persons real name in discussions attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.posting of personal informationshortcutswpoutingwpprivacywpouting redirects here. for the alternate meaning of outing as in excursion see wikipediameetup.for the wikimedia privacy policy see wikimediaprivacy policy.posting another editors personal information is harassment unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information or links to such information on wikipedia. personal information includes legal name date of birth identification numbers home or workplace address job title and work organisation telephone number email address or other contact information whether any such information is accurate or not. posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on wikipedia. this applies to the personal information of both editors and noneditors. it also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username but whose old identifying marks can still be found. any edit that outs someone must be reverted promptly followed by a request for oversight to delete that edit from wikipedia permanently. if an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it it should not be repeated on wikipedia although references to stillexisting selfdisclosed information is not considered outing. if the previously posted information has been removed by oversight then repeating it on wikipedia is considered outing.the fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name making them easily identifiable through online searches is not an excuse for opposition research. dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment just as doing so regarding their past edits on other wikipedia articles may be. however if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. if redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the coi discussion then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on wikipedia it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a coi and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.if you see an editor post personal information about another person do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. when reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. outing should usually be described as an attempted outing or similar to make it clear that the information may or may not be true and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.unless unintentional and nonmalicious for example where wikipedians know each other offsite and may inadvertently post personal information such as using the other persons real name in discussions attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly. ,0

11618,the three misssissippi burning murders had no impact whatsoever on the passage of either the civil right act of or the voting rights act of the civil rights act of passed the senate two days before the murders took place. johnson who intended to symbolically sign the bill into law during the fourth of july week then put his signature on the law just hours after it was passed by the house of representatives on july . the voting rights act was also passed due to pressure from the selma to montgomery marches. in secrecy johnson and king had organized the marches so that they would go beyond extending voting rights and advance war on poverty legislation. the claim about the three mississippi murders having a significant impact on the passage of either of these two laws is just activist folklore which got carried away....,0

11621,thanks . ill edit from the beginning of next month. no harm in dropping a reply to your note since writing here is hardly editing wiki. were michaels mind open to rational persuasion he would have yielded on this long before. his objection is at this point ideological. more examples will not convince him. that we all get things wrong at times is easy to see. what is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong and why we persist in error. on the israeli/jewish side of this common problem there are two elements one cultural one a matter of the politics of imageforging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived. i think michaels error is to be classified in the former which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of jewish exceptionalism and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise palestinian realities that might remind one of similar jewish realities is repressed. michael dislikes uprising because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the warsaw uprising. there is a deeper analogy. the romans crushed bar kochbas revolt which in the historical literature is often described as an uprising and under hadrian set out to romanize judea. the creation of israel vindicates bar kochba but also in rejudaising palestine creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of bar kochba and the plo/hamas/the alaqsa type violence violence in the name of national restoration. this analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of jewish exceptionalism since those who evoke the myth of masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory very much as bar kochba himself did. rabbinical schools after the failure of bar kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states one which lasted until the creation of israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the book of joshua and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of canaan. ironically what is expected of palestinians is that they cringe before the power of israels occupation any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii or zealotism is dismissed as an appalling arab cultural trait though in fact it resonates mutatis mutandis with analogies from jewish history under the roman empire from titus to hadrian where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished. the early zionists from jabotinsky to bengurion to moshe dayan and menachem begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances. being thorough realists they didnt have to kid themselves. today we live in the fog of public opinion myths where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness. people are raised on the standard clichés endlessly recycled by hasbara machines and underwrite them sincerely because they no longer have much of a sense of history. much could be said of this. but this is not the ,0

11625,i am sorry to say was not invited to that championship. so what you are telling is not true. sensei shukumine never had any contact with tosa after tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial karate organization. please see also sensei shukumines personal message at a training seminar in the netherlands with sensei kanai and sensei konno. please see the pictures on the genseiryu website taido and genseiryu people united to celebrate years genseiryu years taido and to commemorate sensei shukumine. besides that there are pictures of sensei shukumine teaching several genseiryu teachers like genseiryu head instructor sensei kanai in genseiryu head dojo situated in ito japan in . ... jun utcwere you at the championship or something? so if mr. tosa never had any contact with mr. shukumine after then please explain these picturse of mr. tosa and mr. shukumine together on the brazilian genseiryu website . zzaroc jun utci am sorry i didnt say sensei shukumine had any contact after . i said he didnt had any contact after sensei tosa turned his back to sensei shukumine. this was after sensei shukumine wrote the preface for sensei tosas book about genseiryu butokukai. and yes i was present at the championship in okinawa amongst other genseiryu practitioners from spain denmark holland and japan. i will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. i need a little time for that i am not an internet black belt sorry for that. ... jun utcyou dont have to be a black belt when your good by the way. but take your time i am patient.but i was wondering. mr. tosa published his book in but there still a picture of him together with mr. shukumine in i mean those pictures on the brazilian site. then there are still a few questionmarks.but by the way did you know that mr. tosa received several letters all over the world just after mr. shukumine died? those letters were asked for permission if some dojos could join the organization of mr. tosa. mr. tosa denied these people to join his organization.there was one person who send such a letter to mr. tosa from holland and you may guess who.and i have got also another question. mr. seiken shukumine past away to an hart attack. but when did he started to get ill? zzaroc jun utcno a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. but in most occasion it shows an amount of training efforttime. and as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.i dont know when mr. tosa turned his back to sensei shukumine so maybe my remark that they didnt had any contact shouldnt be done by me because i am not aware of that specific date. so i apologize for that. but i heard this occured in the mid till end s.no i didnt know that mr. tosa received several letters from all over the world. i know he claimed to get a letter from holland. i know he received one which was delivered by someone from denmark. but i know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by mr. tosa. that is also easy to believe if you are member of a genseiryu organization in ito which was directly connected to sensei shukumine where sensei shukumine still gave in very few occasions lectures about genseiryu pictures are on the way few days necessary. so you can imagine you dont beg for acknowledgement by mr. tosa who only wants you to train his way which is very near to shotokan with the basic kata of shotokan. this dojo in holland is not interested in any connection with mr. tosa. for what reason if you want to train genseiryu the same way as sensei shukumine taught his students? the head instructor of this organization is now sensei kanai one of the first students of sensei shukumine. in sensei shukumines book shin karatedo kyohan there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. i met them during the celebrating anniversary of taido and genseiryu beginning of this year jan. . many nice teachers who still respect sensei shukumine as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.i was never involved with the sickness of sensei shukumine and i dont like to talk about his sickness. i met mr. shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. in okinawa i only met him from a distance. so i am sorry i cant anwer this question for i didnt have such a close relationship with sensei shukumine. ... jun utcim not in,0

11672,in ictu oculias has been explained povfork is one of the ritual phrases you incant on this page because it defies reality it is an excuse to avoid meaningful discourse rather than an attempt at achieving it. if you mean something else which you likely do then use words that are accurate and express your meaning rather than obsessively repeating obviously false statements.as has also been explained repeating long lists of last names without any context e.g. voorst horbury schafer berger maier meier theissen klausner rubenstein boyarin teppler stanton stroumsa kessler sanders neusner are also ritual behaviors that have little semantic content. you have been challenged to produce actual citations which would include book names author year page number and relevant quotations. you continually refuse or fail to do so.when you finally produce a citation that moreorless complies with wpcite albeit with completely idiosyncratic formatting you still get it wrong. for example you just now added what you describe as quarles . in fact the reference is bauckham i know this because i added it myself three weeks ago not only that the material you added was already present in the article in the very section in which i added the citation if you do not read the article then how can you comment on its contents much less attempt to edit them?i have kept your voorst citation and again put it where it belongs. for the longest time the lede had the sentence there are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to christianity and the christian figure of jesus with the citation such as dalman this reference of course is one of your infamous last name only citations which completely fail wpcite. rather than replace it with voorst who makes the same point and is a century newer you oddly repeat the material in a second sentence. there is no rational explanation for doing this that i can see.we absolutely do have a neutral first sentence in the lede despite your best attempts to the contrary that was the clear consensus of the rfc above. you fixation on the claim that yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. it has been your ongoing contention that the name yeshu is merely the name used by rabbis for jesus. however when you insist that yeshu does not refer to an individual or demand proof that it does what you are also demanding is proof that jesus refers to an individual since it is you that insists yeshu=jesus. do you not believe jesus was and indivudal? are you promoting then the jesus myth theory?i am doing my best still to assume good faith here unfortunately to do so i am forced to come to the conclusion that the issue with your edits and comments here is one of competence. i am now very strongly encouraging you to propose changes here accurately citing the reliable sources you would like to use to support those edits. it is not fair to other editors to force them to continually clean up various policy violations and other messes. talk ,0

11678,no bachs taille was essentially the same as lullys taille des hautbois—a straight flarebelled tenor oboe in f. as the wikipedia article plainly states citing the new grove article by michael finkelman the cor anglais only came into existence ca. when a bulb bell was added to the oboe da caccia. sibyl marcuse states that the name did not first start appearing in scores until around . this name was indeed drawn according to finkelman from an older germann term for the the flarebelled horns played by angels in paintings of the middle ages—doubtless shawms of all sorts—engellisches horn meaning angelic horn. there is a distinction to be made as finkelman does between the emergence of the instrument called cor anglais and the german term angelic horn loosely applied to shawms/oboes of all sorts. the french word taille for what it is worth is cognate with english tall and is applied to viols tenor viola da gamba violins tenor violin or viola. the taille des hautbois was known in england as tenor hoboy and purcell scored for it in a good thirty years before the invention of the cor anglais and seventy years before the name first appears in musical scores. to claim that it is essentially the same as the cor anglais is equivalent to saying the tenor lute is essentially the same as a guitar.— ,0

11683,binksternethello enric i just had a very brief discussion with which went as followsme binksternet userkitsunedawn has inserted a new section into amelia earhart which is redundant to the paragraph on gardner island. the new section also seems to have a bit of a wppov issue. i’d rectify the situation myself but the page is protected. i understand you have some history with the article so i thought you might want to know about it.binksternet the added material is far too promotional for tighar. i would like to ask why you the ip editor from northern mississippi did not remove the text yourself. it is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about earhart. nevertheless i am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so.after i finished laughing i started to write a reply but i realized that if binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply. i also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless. i am well aware of my own location.this is not the first time that binksternet has started shit with me. back in november i had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with binksternet when i tried to correct a problem with grey school of wizardry.binksternet indicates in a picture on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required. and while he is entitled to his own opinion he isn’t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at ip editors.the last time i wanted to fix a problem with the earhart article i asked dougweller to do it and he was agreeable. i see now that i should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator but i had thought it would be helpful to alert binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn’t normally edit the article.would you please explain to binksternet that. i can’t edit the article because it is protected and i have already explained that in my first post.. it isn’t civil to baselessly accuse ip editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve wikipedia and operating in goodfaith.. ip editors are allowed to edit wikipedia.thanks. ... ,0

11695,i dont know the poet articles you speak of so i dont know what might be different with them but the rule as i understand it is that poetry should be quoted only as an integrated part of the articles discussion. for example it is not sufficient to say here is a poem by bhupi sherchan but it might be appropriate to say one of the characteristics of bhupi sherchans style is suchandsuch as can be seen in these verses from poem.there was also another consideration which i didnt mention in my edit reason because i thought perhaps it was too obvious this is the englishlanguage wikipedia and there is an expectation that englishlanguage readers can read any article without missing something because its in another language. that doesnt necessarily mean you cant quote from another language at all but if you do it should be accompanied by a suitable translation into english.— ,0

11718,since consensus was to keep and i still felt strongly that the lack of web accessibility was a problem i added spans into the list of rphrases then converted the rphrase template to include a link into the list only to discover that the link target shadows the title attribute for tooltip purposes. to resolve this i created redirects into the list with verbose titles like r explosive when dry. templaterphrase now links to the list via these redirects and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. that way you get your tooltip and i get webaccessibility. i hope this makes sense to you.if ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each rphrase and i think you could with expanded information on the nature of the hazard standards for storage transport and use and a list of chemicals to which the rphrase applies then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article or retarget the redirect at the article. either way you wont have to touch the templates.hesperian,0

11775,ok sorry for the delay in responding properly. from what i can tell the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of ldsrelated articles and those edits were reverted by various editors myself included. now there are two main ways of viewing these facts one that your edits were consistent with wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so two that your edits were not consistent with wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them. this is why i asked you about your understanding of wikipedia policy you are relatively new here and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines. its natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes so it doesnt imply any malice on your part. since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and i regard your edits in light of wp policy it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree. it would be helpful though to know that youve indeed read the pertinent policies so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas. have you done this? thanks /talk/,0
11776,link to ust global leadership team dear edjohnston please find ust global leadership team in the link do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in wikipedia? wiki is an encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. anyway business week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of ust global. fyi the link to the same i think now you might have understood why i was removing this link before. can i ask you to check few pages in wikipedia itself regarding ust global content and find what i am trying to say here? this is very important. could you please check the link this link takes you to the earliest revision history page of ust global. please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user steve ross started editing the page. this wikipedia page was started in and steve came in to picture by . the most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by steve ross. he added himself as cofounder of ust where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of ust global?all you want to know about ust global is available in their website also i want to repeat here that i am not here to violate any rules or policies of wikipedia. i just want to point out the anomalies in this wiki page. could you please listen to my request. this is genuine.,0
11777,yes i agree. the crash section is relevant as for time being. gripen has probably been the most reliable fighter aircraft in service the last years. but in the future as more planes might crash a list will be hard to keep track of and it will make the page look even more stange. can you imagine how a list of the fs crasches would make its page look like? as i said there is a reason why crasches is not listed. ok i will only edit the part about the swedish public thinking that gripen is an embarrassment. its an authors pov about the publics pov not relevant. im a swede myself so i know its not even near the truth anyway.,0

11856,q. how are the barrels rotated?a. the rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems a+b. the motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the hydraulic drive assembly. this in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts. the forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the gau itself while the second delivers its power to the ammunition drum.q. how long is typical spinup time?a. while the system is capable of operating at rounds per minute it is limited to while installed in the aircraft. since the gau has barrels it needs to spin at /th of the firing rate. basically since its rotating a touch over rpm the spinup time is almost instantaneous. on another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish. during the firing of the gau the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters think super spark plugs must fire to ensure a stall does not occur. the engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be water washed have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. % power periodically to remove soot from the blades. anyone who has had to clean an a will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.,0

11873,which would be a perfectly true thing to say about howard dean and probably belongs in an article about the association between mainstream democrats and the communist movement if there is one. if theres not no ones stopping you from creating one.donohues willingness to find offense towards catholicism at the slightest thing a statue of jesus made of chocolate created by a catholic sculptor as a gift to the church is somehow offensive because of some bible passage i must have missed about chocolate being created by the devil while himself constantly using terms of clear derision towards homosexuals jews and asians is a very important point as donohues hypocrisy and selective outrage direclty relates to why the catholic league is considered important. the purpose of the article should be directed towards answering the question of what the catholic league means in american politics. that donohue cares more about calling democrats atheist anal sex fiends so much that he would ally with open racists and actual anticatholics to do so than he does about promoting what many others consider to be mainstream catholic values is very relevant to why donohue is important and worthy of an article here.,0
11874,i agree with you that mansfield probably wouldnt object to the label. hes willing to write a book about manliness after all but i dont think im being oversensitive. ive seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the wikipedia to stigmatize various bush administration officials and it often involves linking together leo strauss neoconservatism and the war in iraq. at one time i thought the wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles publicly identify with the belief in question at least i thought it did although i cant find the relevant passage now and i assumed thats why the comment in the article said mansfield has self identified as a straussian. so when i downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim i changed the language without changing the substance. there are so many conspiracy theories out there about leo strauss and the war in iraq see ghits for the search terms leo strauss war iraq that i tend to be vigilant with notable students of leo strauss since the word straussian has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word straussian? i dont think being a straussian is anything to be ashamed of but i dont like to see the wikipedia being used for pov pushing by people who misunderstand strauss. thank you for the civil reply. best moodygroove,0

11885,request for reconsideration deletion of entry requesting you reexamine the arguments in as per wpdrv.your summary of my argument is factually false. my argument was that the addition of four more reliable sources should carry weight. the statement that the real fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts. also you gave us no time whatever to contact sean treanor and learn more from him in any case an article hosted on stanfords graduate program in journalism webpage and not on a students personal website within could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision.furthermore regarding the real fighter article the president of the american sambo association took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got producedmy name is stephen koepfer and i wrote the original bullshido article/investigation on geraci. i wanted to share my account regarding how the rf acticle came into being since my name has come up here. sacha feinman a noted journalist contacted me about writing an article about geraci. he was as any good journalist would be concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. however reading my article he felt it was well written ivestigated etc. he felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. so i provided all my sources to feinman. he vetted the entire bullshido piece found it to be verifiable and continued to investigate the case in further directions which bullshido had not covered. as feinman noted himself it was the bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. feinman and i did not collaborate on his article other than my making introductions to sources and the subject geraci. feinman was not paid by bullshido nor is he even a member of the site. he came to us because of our notability. i fail to see how the rf article regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions bullshido in print could not be considered a notable reference for bullshido. our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his he came to us because of our notability he personally stated this as such and the subject of the investigation itself geraci is quoted in the rf article as saying the bullshido investigation was accurate.this addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues and you didnt mention it in your summary. nor did you mention carol kaurs wellreasoned argument which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.the only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus. if bullshidos similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.i respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points and ask you to reconsider.,0

11888,about the sum edits i think the way you did it that it goes with two chronologies studio and nonstudio albums it is very confusing and i havent come across any band and this goes for bands with even more albums and eps to have such a split chronology between studio and nonstudio albums. i think itll be for the best if there will be one chronology with all the studio albums live eps etc. like most bands its less confusing that way. full discography could be viewed in the discography page anyway so thats my opinion. i think itll be better this way.,0

11905,likewise catts electromagnetism does not pass muster. displacement current and how to get rid of it throws up quite enough problems. reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current the only real science is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. since displacement current is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. catt et al didnt even try to do this. it would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing displacement current that they can say that it doesnt exist. they are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. catt has quoted davidson as in effect calling the telegraphers equations absurd because they model a tl as a capacitor when catt davidson know that a capacitor is a tl. electromagnetics ch. although catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the tl are based on experiment they are in fact derived from the telegraphers equations in the first place. more superficiality ,0

11939,since it appears that you have escalated your case to arbcom there is really no point in echoing your arguments on your talk page in this way. you should offer any further information directly and exclusively to arbcom via email. if they decide to believe you and reinstate your account you can share the news here with the rest of us at that time.also previously i offered you some very concrete suggestions for establishing who you are as opposed to making claims of who you are not. if you are not in fact justice forever and are serious about wanting to convince arbcom of this fact i would strongly recommend you follow those suggestions asap. your latest piece of new evidence is really about the same as trying to clear your name via a checkuser request — something which as you should already understand is almost never accepted as a way of disproving sockpuppet allegations and which in fact is more often taken as evidence that you are a sock trying to blow smoke in peoples faces. unless you present your most convincing information to arbcom right now you are likely to find them unwilling to listen to anything further you might have to say regardless of its merits.im going to stop watching your talk page at this point. if you are a sock of justice forever youre wasting my time — and if you are not justice forever i may be wasting your time by making you feel there is a reason to continue arguing your case here and in this particular way rather than talking only to arbcom and trying to make the kind of case with them that has a chance though i dont know how much of a chance of actually working. further posting of your arguments here on your talk page is very likely to make some admin decide to block you from being able to edit your talk page and also to semiprotect your talk page to keep you from editing via ip addresses without logging in first.good luck or good riddance depending on who you really are. talk · contribs ,0

11976,not agreed at all. it is clear that the british considered some land east of the jordan to be part of palestine see biger page where he explicitly says it and gives multiple examples. multiple sources have said it and your interpretation notwithstanding no source ive seen so far contradicts it.,0

11979, august utcdisagreement is when you talk about the content of what is written regardless of its source. prejudice is when you personalise it. ,0
11980,as embodied by the ipcc report. this is a perfect example of the type of or that is rampant in the article,0
11981,agreed. doesnt wikipedia have an article on /b/ or just chan? either way we should probably just throw up a link for anyone whos confused.,0
11982, may utc i agree so long as its made clear in the article that putting the instructions of your programs in alphabetical order reverse alphabetical order or totally random order appears to have no affect on the program. a comparison of a computer program to a set of dvds in the article would thoroughly clarify this position. ,0
11983, hm definitely outside my domain of knowledge. i only have the page watchlisted because i reviewed it when it was up for fa status. do you know why the species would appear on the list for ukraine but isnt present on the range map? i suppose it depends on what sources you consult when you make the map. what is the accepted way of resolving such discrepancies? talk ,0

11986,on inspection the references to in the jim bell article are not footnoted. and they never have been since skomorokh added them years ago. the ap essay was begun about april and eventually grew to include parts. the first parts were written in and were published immediately as they were written. part was a copy of an article by a journalist paul maxwell writing in the asahi evening news english language newspaper in japan. it and parts and were written about february . you can be sure that by july the feds were well aware of the content of the thengrowing ap essay. the feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the ap article one technique they used when the applied for a warrant was for the affiant to claim something like i first became aware of the ap essay on.... that specific affiant affidavit writer for you who dont know the law may very well have first become aware on some late date but that doesnt mean that other feds werent aware months or well over a year before. it served the purposes of the feds to make it appear not merely that the ap essay was written far closer to bells may arrest but also to conceal the fact of their agent walsh/wilsons involvement perhaps one year prior to bells first attendance of mcclc meetings. why? it sounds much more like an emergency if something happened yesterday or last week they certainly wouldnt have wanted to have to tell the judge well bell wrote this terrible essay...two years ago this explains i believe why skomorokh claimed the ap essay was written in and furthermore gave no references. at least december sounds reasonably close to early . april on the other hand sounds like an eternity from may the month bell was arrested. ...,0

11997,i can assure you i am not ashamed of myself for questioning the motives of some people here especially those who have attacked me personally as both sune and harlan have. harlan started by discussing personal matters about my family. sune has harassed me throughout several articles on my own talk page and has even reproduced discussions here on his own web pages. so i really have nothing to be ashamed of here. people here who regularly demonstrate dishonesty hurt waldorf and anthroposophy much more than those who point it out when it happens. as for your comment above i called your edits arrogant not you please read carefully... but i did indeed suggest that you have displayed a general rudeness because of your propensity toward sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry as well as your arrogant edits and unwillingness to listen to or participate in reasonable discussion. i dont need to spin anything. you are your own worst enemy and your actions again are available for anyone to see. enjoy your block... ,0
