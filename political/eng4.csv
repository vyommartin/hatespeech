6008,6008, suggestions to improve readability hi guys the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read at least thats what i read in the reader comments. i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing. before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money explain the intent of the system missing right now. sthg like it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party that can dictate credit worthiness or price of transactions as in banks or paypal etc.then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description ive read is when a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. bitcoin miners scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger. by morgen peck in ieee spectrum feb a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. another faq from a washington post blog is here and an article days ago about the death of the mt. gox bitcoin exchange by morgen peck was on science friday today is herebitcoin was also discussed on point last november in conjunction with the senate committee hearing about it. ,0

6017,6017,yeah they really exist. you need at least one w one fa from that class and one w one from that class and you can make the others from them a few carnivores species need more. essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition where for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids sugar vitamins and minerals fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as iv formulas. the reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w and you need w and w fatty acids to make lipids the w dha is your most common neural tissue fat. ill see what i can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. there is some quackery out there like pills that contain w because olive oil is cheap but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking actually unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly. btw there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. this destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all pufas. on such a diet even dogs get severe atherosclerosis and they are species highly resistant to it their hdls are higher than their ldls. so all this is quite fascinating. ,0

6019,6019,comment the term eastern kentucky coal field as seen in those references is used in discussing the geology of the region. in contrast this article is about this region of kentucky as a whole not just about its geology or the occurrence of coal. accordingly i think the article name needs to include the word region for clarity. however the singular coal field might be more appropriate than the plural. the comments placed on this page in suggested cumberland plateau that name and allegheny plateau are both widely recognized physiographic terms but neither of these terms is specific to kentucky see the articles on cumberland plateau and allegheny plateau. ,0
6020,6020,the punk rock page has more meat in the text and its a lot of text content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text . i do see some areas that can be fleshed out . i think the hardcore page wouldnt work with every section in depth like theirs thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore but i do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool . i would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be reuploaded . then it might now be too much and too busy . people read to retain information the right set up enhances that . too many pictures are a distraction . they take away from the knowledge . more fleshed out sections can help . ill brainstorm on that until later . i guess add the picture if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little maybe it will balance itself out more. the third option is we can fill out some sections more . make it more balanced and then add the zines photo after so it accentuates and isnt the meat and potatoes of the section . the sections of influence on other genres . that could be good place to start adding more contentdepth . ill study some other pages meanwhile when i get a chance then bring that knowledge here . a little later . thanks a lot . i love to share knowledge and i like sharing that here for free . ... ,0

6035,6035,what i find a bit strange about the various guidelines and faq pages about categories is that while they contain plenty of fascinating details like hinting at the relationship between graph theory and set theory for no apparent reason they dont really come out and actually say what categories are primarily for helping people find things. while this article isnt exactly exclusively about murdered israeli children in the same way that the gaza war and lebanon war‎ articles arent exactly exclusively about children killed by the idf if a reader was looking for the set of articles related to murdered israeli children i think its reasonable to assume that they should be presented with this one rather than not being presented with this one. talk ,0

6111,6111,the titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles. you see the nature of fiction is that its not necessarily coherent. since this article is not about malcolm wilkerson in the first episode of the show malcolm in the middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. for the entire rest of the seven season run the characters name was only malcolm. this is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy. a title like malcolm xxx my appear clumsy but wilkerson is not an alternative. in my opinion. if cant build consensus on this between the two of us i suggest asking for additional input at wikipedia talknaming conventions since i didnt find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although im fairly sure the fact that the characters name was wilkerson only during the first of episodes of the show means that calling the character wilkerson esp. in the title is inaccurate. — ,0
6112,6112,i just read something interesting. apparently there have never been a minority living in this village. this village was always populated with only bulgarians. not albanians or any other. also when the mosque was build in razgrad there was material taken from this village. the sultan of the ottoman empire issued a ferman declaring that no turkish muslim builder working on the mosque will spend the night there. so it is impossible for his to be albanian because there were never albanians in this village. i found this in wikipedia.,0

6118,6118,relevance? in a new zealand tv series presented by rebecca gibney called sensing murder which aired on tvnz beginning in three psychic mediums from australia and new zealand sue nicholson kelvin cruickshank and deb webber armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. the team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains. skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources and it was further satirized in the season finale where host jeremy wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.just how relevant is this? granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show. we are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. if high profile mediums were used i would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.cheers,0

6123,6123,i apologize for cursing you out. i lost my temper and it was unacceptable. im completely deserved a block although i think you had no right to give it to me. that said looking at the last few pages of your contributions nearly all your edit summaries are mosed reverted unexplained and unsourced changes tidied copyedit or similar. im sure i was overstating the case because i was angry but this does seem to be your main activity in the main space on wikipedia not that theres anything wrong with that its good to have people who copyedit and so forth but i think my basic claim was more or less true. and i dont misunderstand the way wikipedia works. ive been here for four years and ive never run into anyone demanding sources for utterly uncontroversial statements the way that you are. if we are obsessive about this kind of thing wikipedia will never grow and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge. and i think my understanding of this is a lot closer to the way wikipedia actually works than yours is which is based on a completely nonexistent perfect world idea of what wikipedia should be. ,0

6181,6181,==etymology==this etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many waysthe greek name tigris comes from the old persian word for tiger and means the fast one. it might also be argued to come from kurdish too. in kurdish tir means arrow. this means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.tîjtûj means sharp pointing and cutting. since the letter j doesnt exist in greek tîjtûj became tig later greek at the end of words is sonex is used tîjtijrtigtigrtigris. first of all the persian for tiger is babr not tigr or anything like it. the greek word tigris meaning tiger may be related to persian words within the same family as tigr but that is not the persian meaning of the words.second the kurdish and farsi word for arrow tir comes from middle persian tigr which also means arrow.third the word tij or rather tiz sharp is certainly related to tigr but they belong to the same word family they are not the same word.ill try to come up with something better.,0

6210,6210,i disagree that vowel harmony is the place to discuss imutation in welsh. i see no reason why this article or umlaut and amutation for that matter should be restricted to germanic. i think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid regardless of what language its attested in. likewise amutation shouldnt be restricted to germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well again an example from welsh gwyn white masc. < windos vs. gwen white fem. < windā. umlaut should mostly be about the written sign with an indication that it also the name for processes like imutation and amutation. vowel harmony should be about the lefttoright processes typical of uralic and altaic languages. thats what i think. /comhrá,0

6231,6231,===belated merry christmas and hello from a few submissions on contradictions in indian history pages thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages=dear tiptoetyi request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by user dinesh kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.this communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of wikipedia and nothing else. it has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of wikipedia pages whatever we do users like dinesh kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from pov websites etc. just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the chalukya empires especially with reference to the chola empire pls. also remember that in wikipedia for god knows what reason the pages on the chola empire have been christened as chola dynasty despite that the fact that the cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in india but also overseas including sri lanka maldives very large parts of south east asia for at least years of their existence. here are the examples but before that i would like to say this that deliberately user dinesh kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the chola empire saying that the chola territories were taken over by the pandiyas which has a great weakness the chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from onwards and between / to their kings were displaced and the kalachuris under bijjala i and bijjala ii ruled kannada country in india. the chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just years between to after which they went into oblivion. i request that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the cholas whose kings from ad though were not as strong as their kings between ad yet one of their last great kings kulothunga iii on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied madurai karur and sri lanka then known as ilangai between ad. he ruled for around years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty having hoysalas as his allies. yet even with weak kings following him after the cholas lasted till when their last king lost to the pandiyas and the cholas went into oblivion. contrast the above i.e. the demise of the cholas in or to that of the chalukyas who were first of all without a capital for over years and reemerged for just years and became history by ad or thereabouts. yet jingoism seems to get the better of user dinesh kannambadi and he has written in the western chalukya empire page as under the link is and the relevant portion of text is the following“this period saw the fall of two great empires the chalukyas of the western deccan and the cholas of tamilakam. on the ruins of these two empires were built the kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of deccan history for over a hundred years the pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile chola empire.”though technically speaking at least as per the version of dinesh kannambadi the chalukyas fell and demised in / and the cholas demised after almost decades in about /. i.e. within a hundred years of each other i would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression ”this period saw the fall of two great empires” i mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other then the expression could be a little contemporaneous but even as a weak empire the cholas lasted till almost years after the chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the chalukya dynasty which went into oblivion in the year or ???? the point is that whether it is mentioning the hoysalas another kannada empire or the chalukyas he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the cholas.. even while mentioning chalukya architecture user dinesh kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the cholas see this write u,0
6232,6232, locations thailand.while phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in thailand that includes sex tourism. pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism. i dont know phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more nonsex tourists so if i were going to identify a place in thailand if not the world i would mention pattaya instead and i am tempted to edit. i hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more sex for money going on in pattaya than phuket. but for someone considering the phrase sex tourism as not necessarily pejorative i have to qualify this conclusion. note that bar girls in thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general thai population also. although i beleive that there are words in thai for prostitute they mostly at least the girls prefer to call themselves rented wifes albeit for short time rather then long time. i therefore need to be qualify my pattaya versus phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the longterm married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the wifes direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both. there is no such thing as a free lunch and everybody pays for it. note that i neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing and moreover consider them culturally aware particurlay thailand wise. the fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones one must be aware that labels concepts ideas such as sex tourism carry suggestions associated with religion particularly judeochristiamislamic jdi pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the religious worlds worldviews outside of some tribal village usually buddhist and what i like to call giesha cultures e.g. japan thailand etc versus virgin cultures typically jdi that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. note that thai society is strangely contradictory in this regard arent we all but then thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west. perhaps some historioreligious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also. i hate value laden western and religious labels that dress themselves up psuedoscientificly as culturally universal. exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more exploitation going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like chinese factories where labourers girls included work excruciating long hours for a few yuan or rmb. ,0

6250,6250,to cool hand luke i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. from the wikipedia deletion guidelinesdeletion process main article wikipediadeletion policydeletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes. . another quick method is the use of proposed deletion simply add to the top of the article. this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the tag within five days and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required.i thought i complied with this policy it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag. it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. beyond meeting the criterias specifics the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia and that the proposal to delete along with the reasons given which i believe are not in good faith therefore violates various wikipedia policies.the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the users prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of as demonstrated by his reasons or comments to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object wikipedia is not a full time job for most users who only visit the site from time to time and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass redirected the article to another article effectively deleting the original article. in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay and when i hit save the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings in bad faith for what i believe were good faith acts on my part and had me blocked before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.it seems quite clear in light of the above and further facts that can be marshalled in support that this users intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy.recognizing this i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform. i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not as the user had made the dispute personal.as for my being blocked by you as per the revert rule i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a users his apparent violations rather than reply he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times in violation of the rule in bad faith turned the rule on mei did not delete anything and technically i did not revert anything either i think but was adding to previous posts and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post.other indications of bad faiththe user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonics rendezvous band by removing the delete tags. my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove,0

6264,6264,hello zwack gb and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions.i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article. your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. to reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. to start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other. if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. here are a few other good links for newcomersthe five pillars of wikipediahow to edit a pagehelp pagestutorialhow to write a great articlemanual of stylei hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date. if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page. again welcome,0

6270,6270, answer to osli those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open onesidedness with serbs and/or milosevic see znet resource for example. when you mention bosniak sources who are you referring to? do you consider the international tribunal a bosniak source? srebrenica massacre is heavily based on internationa tribunals rulling e.g. radislav krstic judgement and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist garbage with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. the bottom line is alternative views do not matter what matters is coldharded facts from such sources as international tribunal human rights watch statesponsored research documentation centre international missing association or whatever the official name is etc. when it comes to editing this article in a rational matter you are the only one who rejects international tribunals version of the article and seeks serbian or proserbian version of the article. as you can see you are not succeeding and your edits dont stay longer than couple of hours. people will not stand for your version of the article because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by international crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources. ,0
6271,6271,yes i do realize a lot of people made contributions to the article when i approached it. this is why i made a lot of effort to get other opinions on the rewrite and what the article should cover. see talksexrewrite of article wikipedia talkwikiproject sexology and sexuality wikipedia talkwikiproject biologysex and wikipedia talkversion. editorial team/core topicssex. no secret has been made of this rewrite—you can see how difficult it has been to get feedback. this article obviously had no steward as you so aptly describe on your userpage. i chose to become that steward when i proposed and made the rewrite. i would eventually like to take this core article to fa and its been difficult to get any feedback.perhaps you didnt realize it but a see also section is deprecated material should be covered within the body of the article. this came up during the genetics fac. im sorry your link got removed i thought i had covered everything in the article. as i noted on the talk page i think the article should have a top level section on evolution and i think this link could eventually go in there.i like you. im surprised hurt and disappointed that youre so quick to be angry with me. in my past experience and up to now with the sex article ive been too hesitant to throw away old material and too slow to rewrite. because i got no response to my proposal and because the article was so poorly written i went ahead and did it. wikipedia encourages us to be bold. who works on gender seemed happy with it. ✉ ✍ ,0

6289,6289,hi math. thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. i find it very interesting. her pictures of womens bodies as commodities are very disturbing while her photos of morrissey are beautiful. i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book but i couldnt order it from amazon apparently they cant ship it to my country.anyway i know what youre talking about information on linder and ludus is very hard to find. besides the ludus biography you quoted ive come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in the guardian article and here is a long and indepth articleher real name is linda mulvey. the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth liverpool and a bit on her background.i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article.besides the importance of being morrissey linder also appeared in southbank show on the smiths. what other magazine articles have you found about her? shes usually mentioned in connection with morrissey and even that is very rarely. the only magazine article i can think of is that infamous nick kent the face article on the smiths. there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance but its similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to plus some interesting quotes by richard boon and trotter. apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle that pete shelley wrote buzzcocks what do i get as a plea of unrequited love for her and that she inspired a lot of devotos early work. her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life besides cemetry gates shes mentioned in entries for miserable lie wonderful woman last night i dreamt that somebody loved me in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single and i wont share you. in the latter theres another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled crepuscule ludus restrospective the end of the note sounds very familiar oh linder. oh linder. ill see you sometime somewhere. however im not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again its not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours morrissey page is one of the examples but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so i dont know. ,0

6307,6307,=the signature of the atomic bombthere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of japan marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per october or dhu alqidah or heshavan . butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. except from this it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. first. art by artists working both before the world war ii during and after can not necessarily be defined as more or less contemporary because of this timestamp. contemporary art did explicitly exist also before world war ii as this label contemporary has been expressed as a mark of quality pertaining especially to modernism by art carrying an ideal summoning from the artist or his genius making some kind of composed expression of what in such case are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world in the event of the artmaking process including its publication or presentation. another trickster is for me that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. it is absurd as a norwegian to not consider henrik ibsen a maker of contemporary art. his plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. i sincerly believe that henrik ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed or may i say be transported by the unfolding of time. the retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the th century. i think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.,0

6362,6362,im sorry you are wrong on both counts. northumbrian is a different dialect to geordie as you have said. the other dialects from the area are makem and pitmatic. northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of northumberland. i being from northumberland myself actually know what i am talking about. if you live in rural northumberland bearing in mind that the shire as northumberland is a shire county is mostly rural you would have a different dialect to someone from newcastle prudhoe or gateshead as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a geordie accent. also no serious linguist would call all these different dialects geordie. i have heard them grouped as northumbrian dialects but not geordie dialects. calling them northumbrian is correct for two reasons one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as northumbria that is northumberland durham newcastle...etc...on the other point you are mistake. england though not the whole uk can be rightly called a germanic nation. it is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say though it is connected in some ways however traditions language laws and history are england was of course founded by...you guessed it germanic tribes whether they are the predominant dna is besides the point. these tribes were the angles saxons jutes and frisians. you cant deny this as before the english kingdoms england did not exist. our language is obviously germanic though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries it is still west germanic. most of our common traditions such as yule yule itself is a germanic word derived from the norse jul are germanic the eating of a christmas ham mistletoe christmas trees yule logs...etcare all germanic. many of our laws come direct from anglosaxon and danish laws though i agree many were modified by the normans who though descended from norwegians are not culturally germanic.as for selfidentity i would say that the english identify themselves with germanic culture albeit in a subliminal way for example the fact that they use anglosaxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. they are identifying with tribes that were danish and northern german and thus germanic so on that score yes the english are a germanic people.and as you bring up dna casually then firstly i will point out that it isnt proven either way whether the anglosaxon dna is more prominent or whether the british used in this sense as preanglosaxon is. different surveys have different results and none have actually been accepted by all experts. and for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the north east of england the germanic percentage is higher than the british thus the predominant dna is germanic the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is anglosaxon or danish viking blood but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is germanic. i dont care whether the modern english have british or anglosaxon blood as i am partly norsegaelic and partly english...thus being a mix. i just do think that the anglosaxon blood is prominent as do many experts in north eastern england.either way germanic blood or british blood...the english are ethnically germanic.note i am not going to lie and say i am not proud of germanic culture as it is obvious especially by my username but i do consider myself british as the uk isnt about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and i am proud of that also. and by the way there is a good case for northumbria being one of the more germanic parts due in a large part to its folklore especially its creatures that include dvergar which they are actually called...they are dwarves and álfar or more correctly ælfe as they are in old english who are known by the common english word elf but are the older and if i may say more correct type. ,0

6369,6369, hu administrator apparent libel and abuse report to a chairhello this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for mount hood done by administrator hu. toward the bottom at the issue stems from as youll see in the articles history section my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for dan howitt with the press article references.hus postafter going through the google results a disturbing education of sorts there appears to be a long line of aliases for dan howitt posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. it has been removed. id suggest that dan howitt read the following wikipediawikipedia is in the real world and law of unintended consequenceshumy replyplease remove hus libel and vandalism above and please report this users abuse to wikipedia administration. also hu of the google results you searched most are in support of dan howitt with tons of his official summit photos on rainier adams hood shasta and listings of his timing officials. you strangely give weight to the abusive chatsite gossip and unsupported libel and your own post above is of that nature. chatsites with this sort of conduct are sad. im reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki talk note hu cites a link above as support for his allegations of dan howitt. in reading the chatsite thread and note its a mere chatsite and has a lot of personal attacks gossip unfounded content libel etc you will nevertheless find considerable support for howitt including climbing record photos timing officials names etc. hu emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases and this is gossip and unsupported.,0

6385,6385, april utcyou are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. in your last revision of the article you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. once again the statement about public schools and id materials was unsourced when you first added it which is why i removed it. upon further examination i removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the centre for intelligent design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. it is actually very unlikely that this centre for intelligent design did so in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in and this organization arose in . finally believing in the historicity of adam and eve does not make one a fundamentalist. many christians reconcile the genesis creation narrative with science see the biologos foundation for example which advocates evolutionary creation. the entire roman catholic church billion people teaches the historicity of adam and eve and that does not make them young earth creationists or fundamentalists. i have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. i hope this helps. thanks talk ,0

6389,6389, ward churchill admits that he is a lying sob dear ward churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of tv cameras last night february that he is not in fact an indian. he has been lying about his heritage for many many years and people like me who live and work in indian country everyday have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage. i repeat ward churchill during his speech at the university of hawaii admitted that he is not an indian. the comment word for word was published in the honolulu starbulletin vol. issue wednesday february churchill attacks essay’s critics by craig gima. im going to attempt to be gracious but i have to say that you and missed the boat on this one. im not going to do it tonight because i do need sleep but there is going to be huge rewrite of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now. these allegations of fabrications have been provable facts of fabrications. it calls into questions so many other things about the guy. what other things is he out and out lying about??? but more importantly the way that the section on his fake indian heritage needs to be completely rewritten. considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in indian country who dared to question his indian heritage claims over the years i think that indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming. so many peoplewho do not even live in indian country who do not work in indian countrymade the claim that to dare question the great ward churchills fake indian heritage was a cheap shot. we have been hearing that from nonindians for many many years and now churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over years. he claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters. that is a damn lie too. he has been claiming indian heritage for over years. it is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books. he refers to the fake indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article. he committed fraud when he applied to the university of colorado. the denver post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is indian for affirmation action purposes. that is a damned lie. there is going to be rewrite and jodi raves comments are going back in and all the rest. your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by churchill himself. feb utc,0

6414,6414, is this map accurate? =i see some problems with this map it seems to me that this map only shows the very first homosapiens immigrations not the further ones... a for example regarding new zealand this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that i suppose to be the morioris while we know the maoris the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them were actually polinesian... b europe is shown being occupied by settlers from anatolia those were the certainly the paleoeuropeans... this map does not show the further occupation of europe by the indoeuropeans who originated in the caspian basin migrated to europe and pushed the paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.c the brazilian amerindians are not of colombian ancestry they are either of caribbean origin the caribs and arawaks or of paraguayannorthernargentine origin the tupiguaranis. the bulk of the amerindians who were in brazil about the time of the arrival of the portuguese were these tupiguaranis. they came from paraguay and spread all over the brazilian coast till the valley of the amazon river. when you show a map where brazilian amerindians are all coming from colombia you are showing a totally contradictory information. d the dravidians reached india from ethiopia to yemen from yemen to oman from oman to southeast iran from southeast iran to the valley of indus. what is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of india by the indoeuropeans from iran through bactria.e the hipothesis of ancient waves of paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of north america is ignored while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the mithocondrial gene x xenia among northamerican native americans.f this map also seems to ignore the australoid migrations to south america some people claim that the australoids have reached south america before the mongoloids due to some archeological findings in brazil.anyways i believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homosapiens show on that map are only the first the early migrations and the route of their early settling in india should be corrected. also i would suggest a second map showing further homosapiens migrations now including the maori migration from polinesia the correct migrations in south america and the settling of the indoeuropeans in europe.... r. alberto,0

6418,6418,i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i translate i use province of lower silesia etc. however here on wikipedia i have to go with decisions made long ago. the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. some polish people may not care about it because polish is a readerresponsible language so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. by contrast english is a writerresponsible language i.e. writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable. i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article pages . importantly this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity writing should be clear and concise. plain english works best avoid jargon and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. voivodeship is jargon understandable nearly exclusively to polish people.i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now its too late. i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia. ,0

6442,6442, why will gwen gale not read the sources? on august i posted a section on talk death of adolf hitler titled “random questions” which started “i am not a scholar i read wiki but would not think of editing it. but i was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so i am asking some questions. perhaps someone else will read and address them.” the section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with “as to sources the last books i have read are the murder of adolph hitler by hugh thomas sort of shaky and the last days of hitler by anton joachimsthaler english translation i buy much of this.”gwen gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at she replied with ”as the article lead says...this said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. i say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought up...dodgy. gwen gale talk”by this reply it appears that gwen gale is not familiar with the work of joachimsthaler who i have just referenced and thinks that i am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one. at that time i apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions.at i posted” if i had read kershaws nemesis chapter note and epilogue note i wouldnt have wasted your time. you cant get much clearer than that. should be required reading. perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article. thank you for your time.... talk”at i posted “i would like to direct people to the work of ian kershaw hitler nemesis isbn . chapter and the epilogue relate to this article. please pay attention to his notes and sources. be warned his book hitler a biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....the source joachimsthaler is basically an english translation of a germans analysis of s postsoviet interviews of bunker survivors. the original transcripts must be available somewhere. there are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree. wm talk“since those posts i have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which gwen gale has disputed. much of the material i have posted i have later deleted often because i felt that the endless conflict between gwen gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. anyone who is wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. was i sometimes rude and argumentative? absolutely. was i making legitimate points which related to the article? i thought so. did i receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? i think not but you judge.my main point was that joachimsthaler had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which kershaw backed. i repeatedly begged anyone especially gwen gale to read joachimsthaler and kershaw specifically two footnotes i even told the pages of the footnotes. gwen gale clearly had not read either source. i posted under the heading “question for gwen gale” the following ”i lost you but i’m confused myself. it appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.my very low budget suburb is in a system which serves people with million titles numbers approximate thanks carol. kershaw joachimsthaler thomas trevorroper beevor shirer ryan toland eberle/uhl lehmann/carroll o’donnell victor petrova/watson. vinogradov hit a snag reordered. these are books which i have had in my possession and read parts of since aug . i can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but i think that should be addressed. if someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressed...i know that this is p.o.v. and that i am personally involved. but i can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s talkon gwen gale posted “for starters the russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule. gwen gale talk”. by this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either joachimsthaler or kershaw that gwen gale is still not familiar with either work. joachimsthaler was first referenced by me at august and kershaw was referenced by me at august and i believe that they were both on t,0

6472,6472,== cohanim j eleazar phinchas zadok == agree. dr. karl skorecki have the final word about cohanim genetic signatures. he more than anyone else is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about cohanim genetic signatures not jheald. he was the one who discovered the cmh in . after years he came out to announce in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. katz kaplan rappaport shapiro kovacskonh are all j. those surnames and families are the most prestigious cohanim families today. they are all cohanim j. j cohanim is much more common than j cohanim. skorecki reported that pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j this is a very important information that confirms matematical historic and genealogy facts. phinchas was the son of eleazar. itamar was his brother. out of the cohanim houses did belong to eleazarpinchas while only came out from itamar seed. eleazarpinchas j had a much larger population than itamar. all cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses until the destruction of the second temple. so if phinchas is the origin of all cohanim j than it makes sense since his cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother itamar. so it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two cmhs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of cohanim. all genealogic tree for cohanim since aaron until today are still divided into these two houses eleazarpinchas and itamar. during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim —preceding unsigned comment added by ... whaaaat{during the years of the cohanim services mishkan and mikdash the cohanim jews were always selected by the houses. from pinchas and only from itamar. that´s why j cohanim is almost twice as common than j cohanim}lol +dplease stop being stupid and be realj if for real jews arabisraelites decent ...and j is for goyim jewsfalse jews... agree. dr. karl skorecki of the ramban/technion medical center in haifa who is renowned for his discovery in of the kohen genetic signature reported in that he and his research team have discovered not one but two cohen modal haplotypes which he called j and j. pinchas the zealot mentioned in the bible may be the origin of j he suggested. the extended cmh is established for j cohanim only. if somebody in j also has cmh then he is likely to have cohen ancestry. j cohanim form a tight network around cmh. but this is not the case for j. the cmh does not apply to j. if a j is in cmh it tells us nothing about one being a cohen. in j the cmh has no special status. the j lineage of cohanim in cmh could be much more recent. jewish cohanim in j form a much larger network around cmh than jewish cohanim in j do. cohanim jews belong mainly to haplogroup j because cohanim as a group jj have a high frequency of j. the j cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor according to the observed mutation rate which is three times faster than the standard effective rate. j cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly jewish caste jj. “the finding of j among contemporary cohanim can lend credence that today’s cohanim jj may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to phinchas as the founder of j cohanim” concluded dr. karl skorecki.why the confirmation that phinchas may be the orign of j cohanim is so important?“pinchas son of elazar son of aharon the kohen turned back my anger from upon the children of yisrael so i did not destroy the children of yisrael. therefore say behold i give to him my covenant of peace” numbers . “god gave to pinchas a new permanent priesthood for him and his descendants for all generations.” zohar hakadosh a. god indicated that phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counterintuitive form of blessing an allnew form of priesthood. he is given the divine covenant of peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. zadok a des,0

6512,6512,even the claim of essentially segregated lives is bogus. of course lives arent % integrated since these are two different cultures with different customs and languages. but what separation exists is purely voluntary some arabs prefer to live in an arab town/village and thats understandable. most arabs send their kids to arab school so they can study in arabic. however some send their kid to a hebrew speaking school i had an arab classmate for instance whose father was a department head in the city hospital by the way. many arabs live in towns with a jewish majority and theres no law against that and no one prevents them from doing so. several cities in israel have substantially mixed populations including jerusalem haifa jaffa lod ramle beer sheva and others. theres no segregation and no separation. ,0
6513,6513, note the current lead implies israeli aggression against hamas by stating that israel killed several hamas members in khan yunis on july and hamas retaliated with rockets. i have been trying to seek consensus for including the israeli claim that hamas started firing rockets circa june at drn. however it may also be worth noting that israel maintains the hamas members killed in khan yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as israels deadliest attacks in which six palestinian militants died though israel denied any involvement...the israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern gaza area of rafah on the egyptian border where the hamas gunmen died. military spokesman lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into israel. it turns out the same account was given by the new york times when hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives there...hamas blamed israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation. hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an israeli airstrike is not an assertion wikipedia should parrot uncritically. ,0
6514,6514,my reply to the revert issue hello kailash. you asked me the reason for reverting your new upload of and let me tell as it is my duty to inform. firstly you didnt inform me that you are going to upload a new version to the existing poster and you did it. kailash you are a creator of various good articles and uploader of various images in wikipedia with respectable barn stars to your credit and a user with great goodwill and respect among fellow users. should i tell you that your act amounts to vandalism in general ? shall i tell you that even you upload in good faith it will be assumed as vandalism only ? being a honest wikipedian how many times you could have reverted edits showing vandalism ? i didnt specify this because it is a general practice and moreover it would look a bit odd that a user like you indulged in vandalism. so now i think you got your answer. hence i am going to revert back without any reason specified there. still if you revert i will remain silent as i know that you didnt understand me and you are not the same inspiring and honest wikipedian i met during the merging of eega and naan ee. regards,0

6530,6530,regrettably i have to agree about the gameplay section. it comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games using mother as an example than a proper encyclopedic entry. i wont quickfail just for this but i do want it fixed before ill pass. id prefer the section to be rewritten entirely but some glaring points followmother is presented in eight chapters with rotating playercharacters including the protagonists cowboy father the family dog an inept thief and abused monkey so is the protagonist not playable? how large is the party? why are these descriptions in quotes? it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. actually why isnt the protagonist named in this section? again i completely understand the desire to approach this from an outofuniverse perspective but only to the point where the prose doesnt trip over its own detachment.mother begins with naming the members of the playercharacters family along with questions of the players favorite food and thing and opens to a pastoral forest village soon interrupted by a forest fire and the pig mask army who impose police statelike conditions on the village. with the fires outbreak the father ventures out to protect his family twin sons lucas and claus and wife hinawa but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. they set out to take down the pig mask army. lucas the games hero does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. the game features a lighthearted plot with enemies like partying ghosts and talking rope snakes. porky a character from earthbound appears as the leader of the pig mask army and is the games main antagonist. in addition other earthbound characters such as dr. andonuts and mr. saturn also appear. why isnt this stuff in plot? the cast of characters does need to be introduced better but jamming plot details into gameplay isnt the way to do that.the second paragraph is better its more in line with what i expect from a ga gameplay section. at least its good until apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor. whats the predecessors battle system like? remember not everyone reading this has played earthbound.there is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles first of all this should start off with a however or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. the information is also lacking though why isnt there a need to grind for experience? i think of this as one of the central loveitorhateit jrpg mechanics and im curious as to how the genre might work without it. imagine reading a pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed which is unusual for a jrpg without giving a brief overview of how the pc and day care systems work thats how i feel reading this. and lets the player see their magic psi power abilities viewing your abilities probably isnt a necessary gameplay detail but why isnt there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? and do they have uses outside battle like hms rock smash secret power and softboiled do in pokémon?while mother s music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new it features similar sound effects. by completely new do you mean it isnt recycled wholesale or that the style is somehow new? also this bit probably doesnt belong in gameplay.if youre up to rewriting this which i encourage especially if youre shooting for fa id recommend a structure like the followingparagraph its a topdown jrpg theres an overworld you explore towns with your team of characters yada yada yada.paragraph there are battles theyre not random with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles is it like in pokémon colosseum where you only fight other trainers or like in dragon ball z buus fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them? this is how the battle system works this is how items work this is how experience points/leveling work again how is this the case without grinding? or is a different system used entirely?.paragraph your team consists of suchandsuch a number of characters they change with different events in the story characters do/dont return once they leave here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.stuff like items and saving can you save anywhere? work in wherever you want im not picky. september utc,0

6540,6540,re pulp fiction you currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a hour period. additionally users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule. if you continue you may be blocked from editing. please do not repeatedly revert edits but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. if necessary pursue dispute resolution. remember that as per wpccc no consensus is permanent. i have proposed a change as per wpbold and see no protest from any users other than yourself. if you would like to discuss a potential compromise to reach a new consensus i would be more than open to that but simply dismissing my change without any form of discourse goes against the nature of wp. t / c,0

6570,6570,youre kidding right? you think every reference in wikipedia needs to be a web based source so you can check it? from wpcite the citation should state as clearly fully and precisely as possible how a reader can find the source material such as by external link to the source website. if the material is not findable online it should be findable in reputable libraries archives or collections. if a citation without an external link is challenged as unfindable any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably findable though not necessarily reliable providing an isbn or oclc number linking to an established wikipedia article about the source the work its author or its publisher or directly quoting the material on the talk page briefly and in context. ,0
6571,6571,okay i disagree with this just as strongly as i disagree with attempts to say he wasnt jewish. firstly marx didnt kill anybody nor did his ideology. a bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people. and given that the german people managed to produce some unquestionably german people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people im not going to weep for the fact that the germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century. beyond that marx was born and grew up in germany with a very limited connection to his jewish ancestry. his primary language was german and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works. although he spent most of his later life in england ive never really heard that he didnt always consider himself to be a german id think in fact that living in england would have accentuated that. while i do think that his jewish background is important and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a jew his german background was substantially more important than his jewish one. his own works emerged out of posthegelian debates within the german philosophical community and his greatest influence throughout his life and for several decades afterwards was in germany where marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of europe britain france and russia in particular had their own nonmarxist socialist traditions that were not assimilated into marxism for a long time if ever. marx was german of jewish descent. being an internationalist is a statement of intentions for the future of the world not of present day identity. ,0

6587,6587,good point but i cant help to notice the editing history of this article and how it reflects continued polarization against and for it. im not going to implement the same edits again in the reception and criticism section if they are once again reversed. i still support the truism that most rpgplayers with an opinion on this game either love it or hate it and that the game technically is a sequel within the final fantasy universe. x is simply a direct sequel. but like i said if you guys do not want that edit to stay in the r and c section i will not include it again in the same context since it seems so far that several people disagree with that last sentence.,0
6588,6588,i mean really they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith adding information that was included in an already used source. their edit summary didnt show any hostility so you should not retaliate with any. odds are they havent even looked at their talk page so your comment wont be read anyways. if the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out maybe this is a problem you should see about solving instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you. plus antoshi already warned them on their talkpage and they have not added anything since showing that maybe they have listened to the advice. your threat was completely unnecessary. maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added but rejected and why would be a better option. wpagf and wpbite are very important. like i said in the dispute resolution page i dont mean to make any enemies. i think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects. although your attitude when people do things against your wishes needs to be worked on if you wish to avoid further complications. talk·edits ,0

6593,6593,take your time. if and when you go over the history of yost again i will be curious about any mention of scheme especially if such also mentioned mcgugin. if it gives accounts of either one punting that too adds a certain color to their story. given their emphasis on it one has to get a kick punt not intended out of yost teaching his boys to punt or mcgugin booming punts in an allstar game in his th year at vandy. would you happen to know if yost ran the same schemes at his various jobs before michigan? i would assume so and have a few other tenuous reasons to think so.,0
6594,6594,and oh no look who showed up. is it the millions of other editors or hundreds of other admins for wikipedia ready to discuss the atrocity occurring here? no. just the usual suspects. methinks they doth protest too much. ohnoitsjamie says i was warned numerous times about personal attacks but the only ‘evidence’ he links has no warning by him for personal attacks. he says i attacked the person kind enough to mentor me but his link shows no comment by me. he says that ‘if i didnt block you someone else would have.’ stand back everyone. the omniscient ohnoitsjamie is going to predict the future actions of all other admins. case and point. ohnoitsjamie is not interested in the appearance of an impartial decision. he would rather save us all the time that justice takes and act as accuser jury and executioner.,0

6633,6633,and this is why i think youve got blinders on. the cites arent for headline usage only. perhaps you missed the cite for the observer england july which uses hp for harry potter in the article text not in the headline and doesnt ever spell out harry potter it uses hp only. or the atlanta journalconstitution july which spells it out hp harry potter in the text not in the headline. heres a new one going the other way personally i reckon youre either a fellowship of the rings fotr fan or a harry potter hp girl. in this instance a bit of owning up has to be done ive read all the hp books.... the sunday telegraph january . thats also in the text not in the headline. if that will help ill add it to the other discussion as well i stopped digging them up since it was unclear what the problem with the existing cites was. ,0

6637,6637,kurdistan?kurdistan is not a geopolitical region. theres a region called kurdistan in iraq. theres a region called kurdistan in iran. theres no region called kurdistan in turkey. thats akin to placing an algeristan in france and making an article that treats it like a country. there are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. kurds are a minority in turkey just like the hispanics in usa or algerians in france. as ludicrous as it would seem to place a mexicistan or algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in it is to list a kurdistan that includes turkish territory. as long as we dont declare san diego mexicistan which mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a rippedup treaty claiming it it is equally ridiculous to list kurdistan in turkey. in iraq a country that was set up by the british merging territories a region called kurdistan warrants an article as the kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. but i call bs on turkey being listed under kurdistan as turkey does not have a region named kurdistan and kurds are turkish citizens not living under a kurdish state like in iraq whom prints their own passports and such. ,0

6639,6639,where do you see dennis saying step it up? the only thing close to that is his comment here to bump it up which is clearly referring to drn the wikipediadispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall wikipedia dispute resolution process and it is very clear that userbecritical understands that dennis is talking about the wpdr process because becritical actually refers to arbitration followed by dennis mentioning wprfc/u and wikipediaarbitration. stepping it up and/or bumping it up has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you. nor do any of the other comments by dennis even suggest such a thing be done or has been done. secondly you were indeed at the brightline threshold of wprr with three clear reverts in hours had you reverted again within the next minutes yes its just that strict of a line you could have been blocked without further warning since you been warned about rr several times in the past it was very generous of dennis to warn you. you were edit warring against multiple other editors. and just a reminder that you dont have to cross the brightline threshold of wprr to be blocked for edit warrring so be more cautions and find consensus on the talk page instead.dennis is a fine admin and has been nothing but helpful and nice to you i think you should return the favor show him some good faith and stop the accusations of wrongdoing on his part. ☥ ,0

6644,6644,thanks. i nearly drowned when i was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath but somehow i managed to swim back on board s.s titanic. ironic really given what i see coming up ahead. perhaps i should have saved myself the trouble and just stayed in the icy water.your comments are interesting and may well be correct however they dont really address the point i was making regarding the gross almost embarrassingly obvious errors in the academic geek created/mindless computer driven financial models currently used around the world. the most similar theory to the one ive pustulated above comes out of this piece from the prophet robert k. landis where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis. ludwig von mises obviously had similar ideas but no one has really done the hard financial modelling on this austrian school theory and tried to collect longterm historical data tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels the frequency and severity of socalled black swan events in financial markets. my hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels you will see bifurcating bell curve returns i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness.landis comes close but still no cuban cigar. anyway his piece is very topical right now and made for interesting bedtime reading tucked away here as i am in my tiny little third class cabin far far away from the mad money crowd. ,0

6759,6759,improving the twin paradox article hi. any edits i have made to the article have been immidiately reverted. i do not wish to impose my own views on the article. however in its current form it does not in any way reflect the complexity or interest inherent in the problem. as an example of a recent paper which relates to your question so may interest you please see moving observers in an isotropic universe. the paper itself can be downloaded pdf version. this paper differs from my own view but illustrates the inherent and enduring interest of the problem. my major objection to the wikipedia article in its current form is it solves the paradox by mistating it. i.e. by stating a nonparadox in place of the interesting ones. how can i go about getting the article expanded to reflect the varying points of view? i dont want to get involved in a reverting war. any advice you can give me would be much appreciated,0

6780,6780,i repeat the text was about a minority school these schools were the same for every minority not about the treatment of germans in the public. secondly the weak identity thing is a nice lie because then you have to explain why the slovaks did not have weak identity in romania or in serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in hungary although the opposite was the case after the population exchange i will answer you because their schools were shut down in the s. thirdly you somehow forget that whether the minorities not only slovak have a weak identity or not the hungarian government unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction you can play with words but that is a fact bilingual schools even if they would work which they did not are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the magyarisation and this aim was successfully achieved. or are you implying that since the minorities had such weak identity the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language?? do you actually read what you write? ,0

6788,6788, about your comment on elaragirls talk page hello dev i couldnt help but notice your comments on talk page under the heading esperanza so im sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy or elaragirls. i wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with esperanza and some editors how shall i say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others. as for the governance issue i personally dont understand the current structure and i dont feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.i still think that an offwikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on esperanzas page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on wikipedia. whats one more click of the mouse? just so you know i had participated a little in the coffee lounge but i got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which i felt were sexist offensive and not at all belonging on wikipedia. because i had participated only to a limited extent my overall edit count as of wasnt seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.i had proposed a hypothetical merger between esperanza the kindness campaign and concordia and while i still think that many of their stated goals overlap i also feel that esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. i was unaware that esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. if you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant chalk it up to my own shortsightedness not to esperanza as a whole.i know that we may differ in our views of what to do with esperanza but at least the mfd and in particular comments by you elaragirl and others have given the impetus for esperanza to examine itself. thank you for that.since ive typed this much i might as well invite you to review me at editor review. thanks again for your participation in all of this. ,0

6794,6794,from my standpoint you are the confused. im looking at it in the rd person. what the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. fact is that the britons were in an antiangles coalition and the angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. if the britons had contact to the former roman empire is unclear but possible. they lived under roman rule for centuries and were romanized. this defeat was something like deromanizing to them after years of roman rule. this can clearly be seen when you read and understand the roman britainanglosaxon battles in germanic wars.,0

6800,6800,yep that all makes perfect sense and the move is uncontroversial with me and the pages creator with whom i discussed this a bit on the talk page when i made my initial illfated moves. just to clarify what i was after with singular v. plural so as not to appear a plodding dolt i meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre. a point of general interest the other singular pinakes listed in the suda entry arent considered parts of the work known as the pinakes that being πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν. i dont know that i believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments but who am i? going this route id actually be alright with no mention of the/any pinakes appearing on the pinax page this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at athens. thanks for looking at this and i hope that i can get back to that article soonish and will be thinking about the extracallimachean angle that need to be pursued—please let me know if any other names come to mind.,0

6818,6818,for what its worth i suggest you refrain from pushing the socks remarks around as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. given that an spi has been opened and checkuser denied due to stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone it serves no purpose to accuse him further just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. no one is going to win that type of argument. also i suggest you stop calling cowboy jake from now on as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. clearly he is determined to push his case and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. but if you give them enough rope theyll eventually hang themselves with it. challenging suspected socks nonstop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. spi does not support the claim at present and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf whatever the outcome. im sure by rotating ip he probably means proxies. it isnt important though. cheers  chat • rff ,0

6823,6823,==another specific example====under genetic explanations wrn has written this to support these claims they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in iq . black–white–east asian differences in iq reaction time and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. in the united states significant blackwhite iq differences are observable at every age above years within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested in every region of the country and at every time since the invention of ability tests. . jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different iq subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability. from these and other findings they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis. . the rising heritability of iq with age within all races studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at % in infants rises to % in middle childhood and peaks at % in adulthood and studies showing the virtual disappearance . by adulthood of shared environmental effects on iq for example family income education and home environment with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in iq than with strangers from these studies they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for iq difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on iq to fully account for group differences.. studies of us comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races for blacks and for whites across the entire range of iqs despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examinedthis seems to be excessive detail. wrn has essentially recreated rushton/jensen arguments and placed citations in his citation. this essentially allows wrn to write an entire section as if it were incontrovertible based on various references without any possible response. the npov fact that should be reported is that rushton and jensen make some assertions not that they make some assertions and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up. if anything every one of their lines of evidence should be attributed directly to rushton and jensen as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the genetic hypothesis depending on the viewer. it seems very weaselly in any case. can we agree these four points should be removed from the article? comments? ==,0

6834,6834,comment hi there in spite all my effort i don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the english version of the article about alexander voytovych. therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. i’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. wikipedia says “sources may encompass published works in all forms and media and in any language. the art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press ukrainian media academic institutions as well as poets writers and publications use his paintings drawings to illustrate books. the artist takes a part in a busy art life in the ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions art projects. having said that i see that there is no enough evidence for one????? tabbodnar o./боднар о. — л. тайнавтілення. — ужгород карпати . — с. —. — fоtо с. tabgavrosh a./гаврош о. тілолучниці. — л.піраміда . — с. — ілюстрації о.войтович. isbn tabdidyk n./дідик н. fundamentals of composition. — ужгород мистецькалінія . — с.. isbn tabkosmolinska n./космолінська н. art chat on green sofa // fine art. — . — № . — с. — . tabchervatiuk l./черватюк л. womens image in the ukrainian modern art. — к.навчальнакнига . — c. — tabshumylovych b./шумилович б. women paintings and allegories in high heels. // образотворчемистецтво. — . — № . — с. — . if one convinced that the article has to be deleted than do not hesitate to do so but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. what is the difference between the article about alexander voytovych and for example the herb roe’s article why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? i must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page one awards us with thenoticeboards. regarding selfpromotion which was mentioned a few times i’d like to make it clear the artists is a ukrainian and naturally all sources are ukrainian and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. the ukrainian and russian versions of wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it which says a lot.i had in my mind to present more ukrainian artist however having such an experience i’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. thanks for cooperation. from my point of view this discussion is exceeded feel free to delete the article ,0

6836,6836,balance==i find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory. to introduce badoglios career by saying he was an italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing red cross hospitals and ambulances during the ethiopia campaign. due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely. thats words about his military and political career and about his activities as a war criminal. the war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence. if this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of badoglios involvement in the events. it seems to me far more important to stress the facts that badoglio was one of italys most senior military figures during the second world war despite his doubts about italys strategic capabilities and that he became prime minister after the downfall of mussolini. badoglios role in the inexplicable two months delay between july and september when italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while germany rushed troops south to fortify the italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career. whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively badoglios inaction condemned italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war. this article in its present form barely mentions those events. ==,0

6843,6843,article evaluation article evaluation for this assignment i was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about change management. the first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic however it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. they key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. the information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. it most definitely covers a variety of topics including the reasons for such change. in addition to that the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. there is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. the article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text which can be found in the reference section. the contribution considers a variety of perspectives however i think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. it takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. i think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. the article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. it does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. in terms of article length the only thing i would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. overall it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. i couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. in terms of structure i would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.,0

6857,6857,=wolfram===a hypothetic body that completely absorbs all wavelengths of thermal radiation incident on it. such bodies do not reflect light and therefore appear black if their temperatures are low enough so as not to be selfluminous. all blackbodies heated to a given temperature emit thermal radiation with the same spectrum as required by arguments of classical physics involving thermal equilibrium. however the distribution of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength known as the planck law cannot be predicted using classical physics. this fact was the first motivating force behind the development of quantum mechanics. wolfram referenced to eisberg r. and resnick r. thermal radiation. § in quantum physics of atoms molecules solids nuclei and particles nd ed. new york wiley pp. .i think this also supports the must emit part of the definition. ==,0

6872,6872,the table of sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the three sacks in order to raise the yamiking and likewise hydrate to the surface. typically a being from the reverse maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions we see when crimson love and the sacks return to the dark world they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface. my assumption is that an object such as the yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use. thus the table of sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals in the form of a clock to power the yamiking. after the sacks summon the clock crimson and love throw over defeated opponents already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff into each number with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the yamiking. ,0

6923,6923,xenodontlikeit typically when xenophrenic sees a valid edit by wiki policy that he disapproves of for whatever reason he seeks to get others to remove it. this strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance or needs the proper context or isnt the full story etc. there are many different reasons used but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense > to ratio in his pov that average editors cringe when they see it. xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced pov version can only stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. this leads to edit warring over days and even weeks articles often get locked down. some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. some call this tactic a form of wikiterrorism i say it shows that xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent not a terrorist even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.,0
6924,6924, the burke group in response i never provided where he went to school. i added he is a j.d. rather than delete he is a j.d. juris doctor then refer to him as dr. david burke? a j.d. is a doctor of jurisprudence same as a ph.d. why do you allow personal information thats good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more? he was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying he owns a rental property in agoura hills with a meaningless political contribution? the property posted is a rental where he no longer lives and maybe never did. how is that useful in an article about organized labour? you said it yourself the article should be about the company. but in actual fact he is the company. hes a flight instructor whom i know from our fbo flight base operation. lots of people know him. he hasnt contributed to republicans for years. look at the site you provided last one was . why continue to keep outdated useless information? the article cited by dr. john logan a very learned fellow contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. even he can make mistakes. i am a lawyer and logan is a british economist and may understand e.u. law but does not understand u.s. labor law. just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it. there is no newspaper article about cdn that says employees were awarded from the court of appeals. he wrote incorrectly. the citation provided which corrects his article is from the court dockets. which is a better citation? i provided the citation from the law firm that won the civil case against cdn i removed nothing about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between nlrb law and dol law and civil actions filed with the district courts. what john logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the f.a.a. but tried at the d.m.v. are you british? f.a.a. is federal aviation admin. and d.m.v. is dept. of motor vehicles. they are not related anymore than nlrb is to district court or civil cases.. burke works in nlrb jurisdiction and the case you cite is a civil action in district courts not related. if you want cdn discussed first part is fine but the civil action is not. there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for cdn. logans article used as a citation lacks any credible legal citation connecting burke to the civil case. only a legal citation should be used. there are none available. djb is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. no matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed. if you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right. am i being picky? yes. inside the law you cant just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks. deleting facts for fiction is beneath the dignity of what wikipedia has strived to promote. why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions? how is that possible when wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more? you think the sum total for the reader should be that burke owns a rental property in agoura hills? how is that related to the burke group? please stop the generalities and provide facts i contributed and tell me exactly how the citation or tone can be improved and let me do that. also please define what is meant by tone. by the way...are you a wikipedia staff editor or administrator? thank you. arabianrider ,0

6944,6944, march utcthat sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. the rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. you may think that this is obvious but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the ut report were influenced by the funding received.perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? i mean thats about the only way you could ever meet your demand. what an utterly absurd request. its easy to see why it was made though just set the bar so high it cant be jumped then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you dont like. maybe youd have me hack the email accounts of the authors fish around for evidence assuming there is even any there then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that i can cite on here. only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by texas. the universitys state is the heart and soul of us oil gas but thats certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true the university has multimilliondollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the united states not to mention other oil gas companies with interests in fracking. i have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links but only a fool would suggest the potential isnt there. if you dont like the juxtaposition just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak pathetic and denigrating as you like for all i care maybe something like socialist—nay communist—campaigners in the pay of a european maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest noting that... for comparison take the recent globalwarming sceptics at the heartland institute as soon as details of the institutes funding were leaked they were prominently reported in the press. we dont even need leaks here the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out as smm` and others have done. all you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. according to ian urbina we cant even get a decent untarnished report out of the epa unlike texas the epa doesnt even take industry funding for gods sake yet still it cant escape heavy industry pressure to redact. aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes i have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to though i am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry and their paidfor puppets in government to tone down or eliminate negative findings and the truly just ridiculous claims about frackings potential by people like lord browne here in england. and i couldnt care less if frackings safe or not. why should i? or anyone? if its not its not if it is... it is outside of a lunatic asylum who would care? if it is safe enough bring it on jobs tax receipts increased energy security reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldnt be interested in those things particularly given the current economic situation. what i dont like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material. ,0
6945,6945,sure theyre subjective theyre rhetorical i was arguing a case. i still think that the single arrival point article to which all others direct should be the most neutral. i believe that that when dealing with periods in the past should be assumed to be the title used in the subjects own time necessarily adjusted for the english language in an e lang encyclopedia here philip the tetrarch. the herod philips have to be there because people will search for them. these pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time and then send the seeker to the historical name. if someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that theologians use ... and historians use ... that would be a welcome addition. this means that all the terms would be in wikipedia they would all be findable and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information and i trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. i dont want to move any pages just tidy up the way of finding them. i dont think this is as strong an advice as you do more of a signpost perhaps a better image than guide? in particular i was astonished when i began this by the confusion over hp i hp ii. evidence for the elder philip seems minimal.,0

6988,6988,the reviews section doesnt give anywhere near as clear a summary as the infobox does/did not to mention the fact that there isnt even a clear reviews section on this article. as for duplicate information the remaining infobox contains plenty of that. the recording date genre length chronology of albums etc. is all available elsewhere on the page surely we should delete that too?,0
6989,6989, well have a look at this photo especially what the grabber is doing with his hands its very plausible and highly likely that there were scratches. i use grabber guardedly since a person who by force of arms takes and carries away is a robber at least here under the common law so a more accurate description would be attempted robber. as for your argument about idiocy... thats like saying rape victims are at fault by wearing skimpy dresses. whats wrong is wrong is wrong and using violence against an innocent civilian to promote a political agenda is wrong and you cannot justify it by the tenuously connected actions of another. talk ,0

7000,7000,my twopennorth is that it is probably better to say apartheid in terms of south africa but in rhodesia one should prefer the term european and african. this doesnt imply that the governments were directed by europe merely that they were composed of people who were descended from european settlers. this was the accepted term used at the time. rhodesia did not have an apartheid system it was at times suggested but ruled out as impractical. .  fys aym.,0

7006,7006,well i am not goint to stay it simply to much of a waste of time maybe i will check back in in a few years and i would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me. it would not be hard to find my real email address using the information about me you already know. but i will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation. the tangut did not speak chinese they spoke their own language. the official name of their land in their own language has been written about by ksenia kepping and is available on a link from the tangut language page. in no case was xia there autonym. it was something like minyag which is waht they are called in tibetan. in general i have a big chip on my sholder about sinologists becomming confucian literati. the yuan and qing were no more chinese than i am. to use chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval chinese worldview. while now it is indeed true that the prc owns a big chunk of asia how much of it is actually historically china?the jurchens kitans tangut mongols tibetans nanchao azha tüyühün were their own countries with their own languages and customs. tangut history is relevant to chinese history in the way that french history is relevant to english history but also vice versa. to have a thing on the article saying this article is part of the section chinese history reinforces the view that the tanguts dont deserve their own history. there is a sociological fact about western academia that sinology is big and well funded while tangutology nanchaology kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. but this is a fact about us and not about the history of central/east asia.,0

7008,7008,trivia is just that trivia. its trivial by nature. just because you think its interesting doesnt mean its useful. as the onus is on the editor adding material perhaps we might have a reason for this list to be here. what other films and i mean good articles contain such a shopping list of items? what is useful about knowing that a film uses artistic licence and props that arent the real thing? is that really so surprising that every one has to be listed.and ive heard the ignore and rules pleading before a very good way to cut that line of argument short is to ask how does it improve the article?. ,0

7010,7010,what i wrote on your talk page was not another personal attack it was a referring statement to the one you warned me about and thus why i commented on your talk page. as i said in my dispute read the context. it is not another personal attack. i made a personal attack because this person is a vandal who does nothing to improve the article. it is not a content disputer. he is a clear vandal the edit history i love his revert of my first edit you know... the one that says what article? and then i revert that saying not to edit it if you havent even read it. and so on. great stuff man dont expect people to get angry at repeated vandals who really arent doing anything to improve an article. it gets really annoying you know especially when vandals start adding defamation to an article. ... ,0

7025,7025,gilad atzmon article and incessent pov vandalism how dare you put this notice on my talkpage + simply for my efforts to add some responsible balance to the article on gilad atzmon which now reads as a unadorned love letter to i.e. whitewash of a performer with profoundly racist and fascistic views. atzmons groupies on this board such as felixfelix and edna spennato a close personal friend of atzmon have been relentlessly censoring and reverting all the documented evidence that puts their hero in a less than fully flattering light. it is therefore they who are the major perpetrators of pov vandalism to that page. your hideous targeting of me a dedicated antiracist and antifascist activist shows either complete ignorance on your part or a bias that ultimately enables nazi racists attempting genocide. if you do not remove this harrasement from my talkpage i will be contacting the relevant higherups at wikipedia.,0

7043,7043,im not talking about belief of majority. in fact i would presume a billion muslims specifically state he did not claim to be god and many of other faiths would agree. im saying i dont think we have any facts to solidly state by encyclopedia standards whether jesus claimed to be a god or not. you can object because its unclear but your statement he did not claim he was god is merely your opinion. you really cant prove it. considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god i think may make it relevant here but i could see taking it off as disputed. although if you want to get into it in many books ive read indicate hong xiuquan did not claim to be god either. he believed that jesus was the son of god but not god. he had an arian view of jesus and of his own role as son of god. although i added her it sounds possible that this mita woman only believed she contained the holy spirit rather then was the holy spirit. yet you dont object on those or ones that may even be more debatable. in least in the case of jesus the idea he claimed to be god is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him. ,0

7072,7072, vienna dude seriously. wprs and wpv dont get thrown out the window just because mary jo foley of microsoft provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a socalled spokesman about the change in name. nobody at microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say yes the name is vienna in the last few days. doesnt that strike you as somewhat odd? we can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team or a page on microsofts web site. not this time. im not going to bother with renaming back to windows blackcomb since youll probably change it back to vienna without bothering with that nagging wikipedia requirement of verifiability. this isnt a race. okay... whats the point of these constant reverts back to blackcomb? im really sure now that the codename is vienna. the change was recent lets not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. no offense but you seem to like the name blackcomb much better than vienna. get over it. it was changed. now it wasnt only scoble who confirmed it. my guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. several sources claim its vienna so lets keep it that way. there were rumours about longhorn being changed to vista but later it was confirmed. lets just leave the article alone for right now. — ,0

7090,7090,ok no reordering. but can we give them designations like this? im calling it list a so we can start a new list later without confusion. if you dont like it well work something else out but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying hey getting back to that thing we were talking about the bit where it says that gage was traveling not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah.one point we absolutely cannot refer to note x and ref and so on. these designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy. in the below ive substituted permalinks instead. issues list aa backgroundaa he may have gained skill with explosives on his familys farms or in nearby mines and quarries... speculation from macmillan. attribute it.ab gages date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing.a gages accidentaa does not address numerous theories presented or gages actions prior to accident. eeng knows all too well this subject. i think ratiu and van horns material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull. i do not know why this is absent. i have issues with the section but ill hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now.a subsequent life and travelsaa bt. february he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses barn feedg. ye cattle that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that bore it well. paraphrase.ab would gages mental impairment belong here? i think it would be helpful.ac missing gages time in new hampshire prior to chile.ad chile and california is missing the account of gages doctor and missing some other tidbits not too bad but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason.ae this is also the key section that macmillans research becomes quite useful as a case argument.a death and subsequent travelsaa still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home illness and death. ab also the exhumation details which was in fleischmans book is entirely absent. this little episode in the gage story is something which is important. a other mattersaa analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding gage and his role in science has been well mostly avoided by the article. instead of proper detailing of the injury and gages role in history. ab only a few hundred words on gages mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used.ac using passim and other issues in citing macmillan is also a copout and would merit a verifiability failure.ad not even that it doesnt even credit macmillan when it should.a notesaa a substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes. these complex rambling and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious.ab a note like which reads see macmillan lena harlow bigelow– harlow macmillan. is just improper.ac note macmillans book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary ... the definitive account ... is just the type of note we do not need.ac for gages time in new hampshire didnt he spent months in a horse stable?the article saysgage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in hanover new hampshireharlow says this began sometime in and he remained there without any interruption from ill health for nearly or quite a year and a half. this fits with jmhs jhm = john martyn harlow information that pg went to chile in august . how about if we change it to for about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in hanover new hampshirethoughts? aa missing details surrounding return home illness and deathbut he was in chile for about years correct? then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer im not sure if this is on one or several farms but wasnt the convulsions following a days labor on the farm? the seizures,0

7104,7104,requests for commentive echoed the suggestions of mackensen and others that you take this to wikipediarequests for comment. your most recent reply on mackensens talk page is i could but i think arbcom should accept the case with or without an rfc. theres too much misconduct to willfully ignore. besides youre only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable why would i ever take that advice?there are several problems with this response firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through rfc the closer or the first articles for deletion discussion who as far as i can tell played no part in earlier discussions who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions and an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said if you cant be bothered with an rfc then we cant be bothered with an arbitration case. has also remarked on your failure to follow process here. again you allege misconduct on a scale too great to wilfully ignore. if there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators cant see it it looks like youll have to make it more apparent to them.but finally despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to rfc you say that i in particular am only asking you to go to rfc to delay the inevitable. well im not sure that you and i can agree on what the inevitable is in this case. to my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldnt like to hear what the arbitrators have to say and theyve hinted on this in their comments on the case. but since theyre obviously not going to accept the case until youve at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution im urging you to do so. if an arbitration case follows the sooner the better as far as im concerned so get cracking. tony sidaway ,0

7111,7111,dear michael thanks for your comment. i made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly years ago see the version at that time . it said einstein–cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity to handle spin angular momentum correctly. at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity without extensions describes the spin incorrectly. as far as i can read this is no longer claimed by the article. einsteincartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity with some extra fields torsion but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields dont exist and theyre not needed. if you care about sociology no research of cosmology or calculations of nasas experiments or anything of the sort takes the torsion field into account because the latter doesnt exist as far as the existing evidence theoretical or experimental can say. today its not an important proposal to extend gr. the new article doesnt make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity without torsion is inconsistent with the spin or something like that so i wouldnt protest against the new version. visually it surely looks like a wellwritten article. however i see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesnt explain the basic points too clearly. einsteincartan theory is not just about the tetrads. tetrads are indeed useful and in some formal sense necessary to describe spin in general relativity. however using the tetrads formalism is not yet einsteincartan theory. einsteincartan theory assumes that torsion may be nonzero even though it is identically zero in general relativity which normally uses the metric. one can write gr in terms of tetrads as well and the torsion is still zero. if thats so one isnt doing einsteincartan theory. ,0

7131,7131,mentioning darwin gave up natural selection and became a lamarckianthe article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of the origin of species which went into different editions by . hence i propose the following insert at the first darwin quotation in the current section ‘publication of the theory of natural selection’ which i also propose should be retitled ‘publication of the darwin’s theory of evolution’.proposed inserthowever even in the first edition of his book darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection but not the only one. in the last sentence of its introduction he said “furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”but by he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution with its strong principle of inheritance in favour of lamarckian environmentalism with a changing environment as the main selector. as c.d. darlington wrote in in his foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of the originlet no one imagine however that in the world of science darwins theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. on the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....the most abiding source of trouble was that discovered by the professor of engineering at edinburgh. professor flemingsic jenkin pointed out in that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type and its differences as darwin believed blended in inheritance. nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. darwins defence against this objection was already prepared. he had hinted it in the first edition of the origin of species at the end of the introduction he had said that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification. in later editions he hedged further. he fell back on the other means. these depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. in adopting this view darwin was giving up his own and wallaces peculiar claim to originality he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of lamarck. p. xvii on the origin of species by means of natural selection first edition reprint in the thinkers library by watts co . but darlington failed to establish lamarcks theory was discarded or disreputable. in fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the midth century with the ‘mendeliandarwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. but even by darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to darlingtonin view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that darwinism in all civilised countries would be taught as one of the foundations of thought that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. that is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. but where as in its applications to ourselves in the study of the genetics of men and to the histories of nations as exact knowledge of the principles of variation hybridization and selection is required we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. at the same time the foundation of darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in darwins own country. the universities with their museums and botanic gardens are happy to forget what in they were unable to resist. they contain no memorial of his work and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. the old pedantic learning of botany and zoology which darwin treated as one subject they continue to cleave asunder burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction. ‘’ibid’’ pxviiixix. i also propose the following edit of the articles introductionhis book ‘’on the origin of species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species but by its sixth edition darwin had abandon,0

7137,7137, spventi but perhaps its safest to discuss your concerns before making arbitrary changes. indeedly. sorry for my thoughtlessness.i have no intention to suggest a change from nakashite to nakasete but would feel better if miseyo is changed to miseu or miseyou because みせよ cannot be an expression of version in spventi referred is modernized in wording and both of the two sources say it was written by 松浦靜山 i would say みせう is the original. plus the explanation 「松浦靜山の『甲子夜話』にみえる川柳。おそらくはよみ人知らず」 sounds much more reliable than 「江戸後期の平戸藩主・松浦静山が詠んだ句」. then みせよう should be a more adequate modern japanese word here than みよう. i suspect that it might be a typo or mistranslation. now here is a third source a text book for juniorhigh isbn in which the one for hideyoshi is written as 鳴かぬなら鳴かしてみせようほととぎす. spventi then the onus is on you to provide information that suggests otherwise. indeedly. but i cant find an english word to express hototogisu. that is why i questioned. it is a family of cuckoo but smaller. and it really sings. a popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come while hototogisu being the one for the summer. here is an illustration. i was not suggesting to change the word but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. if not it can stay as it your concern about the word coax is entirely misplaced. and jimlockhart i think coax is fine for saying that hmmm. i withdraw. i trust you two than my dictionaries. one comment to jimlockhart. yes he used flattery when necessary especially in his early times and i dont think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. that was not my worry. what i wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. you wrote resourseful as he was that i accepted the word coax and the form without first person i admit spventis saying the changes you made to the english versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements. sorry again. one last question dont you feel like making some mutial reference between this section and toyotomihideyoshiculturalpointofinterest? ,0

7139,7139,but the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. for instance youve assumed i wanted roux gone when theres never been any such expressed desire from me either im or explicitly neither before nor now. it also seems that youve excused roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for not to say i feel i should be excused from anything ive done.if i may express my opinion roux is a good editor but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique yes i bare my own biases but i come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences and recent events seem to show that it isnt changing. it is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim and seemingly sensing some threat responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. while that can cause some problem in itself the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who dont buy his claims of innocence and casualty after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. if it wasnt already obvious i am one of those stubborn persons believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. thus i honestly dont for one minute buy that roux was driven to do anything he chose to participate here in the manners that he did both good and bad and he chose to leave just as i chose to participate in the manners that i did chose to leave chose to come back chose to leave again chose to come back and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things. i like the idea of roux no longer being an obstacle but do not feel comfortable about the way in which it came to be im not sure that anybodys actually won in this case. ,0

7256,7256,schulich school of business hello ckatz. i wonder about consensus when wikipedia also provides the following guidance votes are not necessarily binding. have i misread something? a couple of anonymous ips an alumnus and cyrill... represent a consensus do they? i can get ten times that number if i asked my friends to join. then what? senior editors should answer questions or refer people who want to know to the right place. lets act on principle. i want to know if ranking mba programmes or any programme constitutes a comercial activity. it seems like marketing to me. how about you? consensus will always go in favour of selfinterested cliques like alumni are when they subvert a generalknowledge wikipedia page into a marketing arm for an institution.,0

7260,7260,hi again. i do have this in the back of my mind and am aware of it. apologies for being slow getting back to you.its a really hot day here in the uk after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. im not sure what youre asking me. i think youre talking about categorybeverage companies and how breweries end up there. at some point that has been organised thus categorybeverage companies categoryalcoholic beverage companies categorybeer and breweries by region categorybeer and breweries in north america categorybeer and breweries in the united states categorybeer and breweries in alabama. the brewing companies are contained within each beer and breweries in foo cat. what you are proposing is the same thing as already exists but separating the companies from the brands at a low level and then having two cats one of products and one of companies running side by side up the tree. what i am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. wed like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multipurpose cat. beer and brewery are often related. bass and heneiken for example refer both to product and company. where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article. would you ping me when you respond otherwise this might drift a bit. yes ,0

7292,7292, october utcif i made some error then why cant someone explain it to me on the talk page? i am not pushing a pov.i edited an inflammatory sentence about a jewish issue in the schlafly biography page. i think that the sentence is antijewish but you may have your own opinion. maybe you think the sentence is projewish. either way the sentence is contrary to wp blp policy and must be removed immediately unless it is reliably sourced.the source is a paragraph in a ny times book review by a jewish columnist. schlafly did not write the book in question and schlafly is not jewish. the book is not about jews. the paragraph is not backed up by anything. the paragraph is partially explained by the fact that columnist is jewish and likes to write about jewish issues. the paragraph is a criticism of the book and not a criticism of schlafly.i think that the sentence is too unsupported and too far removed and too strange to even be included in an article about schlafly. but if it is going to be there then it should stick to what the ny times columnist said. i believe that the sentence in dispute implies something about schlafly that is not stated in the ny times book review. that is what i argued on the talk page and no one rebutted that argument.blocking me is just a way to put a false and defamatory allegation about a living person in a wp article. it is wrong and those who put this jewrelated allegation in should be blocked not me. ,0

7307,7307,exactly kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song behind these hazel eyes. comparing the pictures of kelly and belle they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it belles eyes are little lighter. someone made a video called behind belles hazel eyes the person who made this video knew what color belles eyes were and decided to include belles name in the title. and if you read the comments the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved. i like the problem solved part. with minotaurgirls bias against the idea of belle having hazel eyes i think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.tv tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her so much so they forbade users from writting what belles eye color is. notice how belles name is missing from the eye color tropes colony while the rest of disney princesses have their eye color mentioned. belles name was there under the category of hazel eyes until minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. same thing almost happened to disney wiki. this is minotaurgirls account as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite the reason inserting false information the false information being writting down belles eyes as brown. and now heres minotaurgirl on the wikipedia. is there any repsite from her?i noticed she has a live journal account. see what she has written. the lack of links speaks for itself. she thinks she actually proved belles eyes are brown depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie like the screenshots she send me. by magnifying the images you can see her eyes are hazelcolored and not the same color as her hair at all. notice how shes afriad to use closeups of belles eye cuz she knows theyll appear hazel if she did so thus disproving her. on her blog she didnt mention that she was blocked on disney wiki and said the only reason disney wiki kept belles eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel when in reality the one who got shut up was minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didnt. she wrote bleh. kids these days. this one needs a hobby. im tired of wasting time trying to undo this snots damage and im fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners? yup she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobbyless kids if the evidence goes against what minotaurgirl said/believes.if anyone deserves to be blocked its minotaurgirl. if it wasnt for her bias sites like like tv tropes disney wiki and the wikipedia wouldnt have suffered an edit war about belles eye color. the fact that there was never an edit about belles eye color until minotaurgirl came along says a lot. ever since she got blocked from disney wiki almost an year ago no edit war about belles eye color happened there either. its like minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept belles eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown just cuz she likes to think so not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. its like someone going around changing ariels eyes from blue to green just cuz he likes the idea of ariel being greeneyed. thinks dont work like that.my overall opinion on minotaurgurl. i think its safe to say the interent is better off without her. shes toxic shes a nuisance shes talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her she lies she mangles twists and misrepresents other peoples words and she causes edit wars. action needs to be taken against people like this. ,0

7436,7436,ralf reski may meet the criteria but if he does there is no evidence of that in the article. if he indeed does meet the criteria please add the evidence for this to the article. while it is true that these are just guidelines and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made. i’m not trying to prove that he isn’t notable i’m trying to determine if he is.as far as i can see the criteria are not met. the persons research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline broadly construed as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.i’m not a fan of citation metrics and they’re not the final word but the hindex is which is pretty average. the most cited paper does have over citations but that’s the moss genome sequence where he’s one of many authors. genome sequences always get lots of citations.. the person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.this may be true but the article does not mention it. i don’t think a heisenberg fellowship counts as ‘highly prestigious.. the person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association e.g. a national academy of sciences or the royal society or a fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor e.g. the ieee.again this may be true but isn’t mentioned in the article.. the persons academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education affecting a substantial number of academic institutions.no major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article.. the person holds or has held a named chair appointment or distinguished professor appointment at a major institution of higher education and research.no evidence for this is given in the article.. the person has held a major highestlevel elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society.from what i can see in the article the highest position he has held was dean of the faculty of biology. the person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.no evidence for this given in the article.. the person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major wellestablished academic journal in their subject area.only normal editorial board memberships given in the article.. the person is in a field of literature e.g writer or poet or the fine arts e.g. musician composer artist and meets the standards for notability in that art such as wpcreative or wpmusic.does not apply.if you can show that the criteria are met after all i’m happy to go along with it but just being a professor does not satisfy wpprof. cheers ,0

7449,7449,hey there buddy i am backa quote from kenneth tennyson phd.the sad thing is that our fellow here freedom skies appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that he is educated it is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.firstly can you tell me what being american or british is? america and britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from italy ireland china guatemala and so forth. so if freedom skies is being proud of his culture is that evil? secondly you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. suggestion join the marine corps. that is one thing i have learned is understanding the world through travel. thirdly i am utterly shocked at your comment on freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing if not a scary thing. does that threaten you that indians are educated? please answer yes or no no need to give a disertation or oration thank you. also that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the southern part of america during the civil war used to consider blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. as a matter of fact it was illegal for an afroamerican to go to school or even learn to read since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. i will even go a further step to say that back then these racists from the colonial south felt threatened that the slaves would become a very powerful and scary radicalized community. regarding your previous posts here is some food for thought. in the marine corps as a gunny sgt. or someone in command if you are at a bar or a party you never show that you are drunk. if you are drunk you do not admit it... youre basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia and in some cases cases??? learn from that pal...,0

7453,7453,water in the coliseumfwiw i watched a program on the history channel a couple of months ago the focus of which was a chemical study of the makeup of the plaster used in the coliseum and examination of the flooding and drainage facilities the romans had built into the coliseum.the program concluded that the plaster used contained small but notable amounts of the substance that the romans used in aqueducts for waterproofing but not enough that it was designed to be a permanent feature of the arena. it also concluded that the coliseum could have been flooded overnight and that it was probably built with it being flooded shortly after completion but not again after that in mind.i can’t find in the brief search i’ve just done anything i can cite so i’m not going to put it into the article yet but i’d say that the section relating to the flooding of the coliseum is probably slightly out of date.,0

7469,7469,the previous comment makes several incorrect statements about baybayins status as a script the origin of its name and what sanskrit refers to. baybayin is a single script like latin arabic or devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. it is most definitely not a group or family of scripts no separate sulat bisaya ever existed and authentic kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of baybayin. there were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. scott villamor and especially santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region even from the same document shows moer differences than the socalled regional scripts written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. modern kulitan or súlat kapampangan is the recent invention of one person who took a th century french visitors interpretation of baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from pampanga and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of kawi and korean hangul. it is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. the name baybayin originated with tagalog speakers not the spanish who at first just called it sus letras their letters. baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order. sanskrit is a language not a script or group of scripts. all these facts can be checked in the existing literature. anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least paul morrows web site ang baybayin santamarías el baybayin en el archivo de santo tomas villamors the old philippine writing/la antigua escritura filipina and marcilla y martíns estudio de los antiguos alfabetos filipinos. ,0

7494,7494,wow interesting information. first let me say that i dont doubt the truth of what youre saying. however because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source it qualifies as original research which is not permitted on wikipedia. typically this type of information would have to be removed from an article. given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation however ill leave it in with the citation needed tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon ill look tomorrow. i feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source however another editor could come along and justifiably remove it. if that happens we will have to find a source to add it again. · talk · ,0

7504,7504,jeztah the explaination above that since the article of the war is called lebanon war and since that war only since has been called the first lebanon war only in and to israel then this war should be called lebanon war is incorrect and that logic is not supported by wikipedia policy. the lebanon has very little credentials as i am proving above. israelhezbollah war carries no pov implications the excuse named above is purely original and cannot be heard anywhere else in all seriousness. using his logic lebanon war would be incorrect since fighting began and took place in israel as well. israelhezbollah war meets the criteria of rule and . neither nor any other editor has come close to proving another single name. and c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict. way to make up wikipedia policy i do not appreciate that at at all. you know as an editor that that is purely and totally irrelevant. i agree that lebanon war isnt perfect but it is the closest to meeting wikipedia policy we have found thus far. also the c it doesnt list the party that suffered the most death and destruction as a result of the conflict. is entirely relevant to wikipedia policy per naming conventions rule . it becomes quickly apparent to anyone doing even the minimum amount of research that israelhezbollah war doesnt meet rules or . it might meet rule though that is also disputable. — talk ,0

7529,7529,dbinder you asked if someone could verify those possible future regional members... well if someone really could they wouldnt be possible future members but future members....anywayas sas ownes the majority stake in arbaltic and a % stake in estonian air with whome they have a close coopeartion so its very likely that these two airlines will go the way that blue already went and join the alliance as regional members.air one is very close with lufthansa and fully integrated in lufthansas miles ffp. in fact they are the only fully integrated airline that is not a star alliance member yet. but that seems to be a matter of time.at the very moment austrian airlines ownes a % stake in slovak airlines. as the slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that austrian will accquire these stakes. a star alliance membership is absolutely possible. silk air is a fully owned subsidiary of singapore airlines. i wont comment on that as i have never heard of them being a candidate for alliance membership but doesnt seem unlikely.aegean airlines and lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the german press both airlines seem to be very interessted in aegean joining the alliance.luxair has strong ties to lufthansa and austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future but would definitely be welcome in the alliancesince you removed qatar airways from the list of possible members... its no secret that star is really interessterd in qatar airways. on the other hand qatar airways strengthened their cooperation with lufthansa ana and united last year... they are definitely leaning towards star alliance.they are at least as likely to join star as tam or sn brussles etc. to join oneworld / malaysia airlines to join skyteam,0

7610,7610,karamu high schoolhi gadfium thank you for starting the page on karamu hs but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the karamu hs bot will now administer information for the site. thanks —preceding unsigned comment added by ... you are welcome to edit the article but you cannot control it. please add only information which can be sourced. you also cannot copy information directly from the internet unless that information is under a suitable open content licence usually ccbysa. for the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable you will have to place such a licence statement on that page. otherwise you are violating the schools copyright. there are alternatives such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material which would have to go to someone higher in wikipedia than me. its much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website. you can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs.i suggest you always edit using an account since your ip address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person. you should also use an account representing a single person not the whole bot. see wporgname.finally you have a conflict of interest on the article. this doesnt prevent you from making purely factual edits but you should not attempt to promote the school by for example using peacock phrases. it gets tricky if there is material critical of the school in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly. i accepted the removal of the section on the ero crisis which was unsourced and out of date although quite interesting. that was not critical of your school but i think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.gadfium thanks for the message. not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this wiki. are you a past pupil? the bot are confused why you are seeking to edit the wiki when the school and the bot are the legal owners of the school and its information. quite happy to stick within the guidelines of wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg generally regarded by residents as less conservative where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim? who decides karamus alumni? all information on our website has been written with bot delegated authority and is the proprty of the bot so no problems there. will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when i have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for khs is simply not an accurate information page for khs in and the bot are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... i am not a former student at the school. i edit wikipedia on many subjects mostly to do with new zealand. i am concerned that articles be accurate but i also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles.you are probably correct that the bot owns the school. it probably also owns the copyright on the school website. it clearly does not own all information about the school and it does not own any wikipedia article. we cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the schools website to wikipedia simply because they claim to represent the bot unless we have proof that they actually do so. to put any material on wikipedia is to licence it under wikipedias terms of use which is under a ccbysa licence. i am not allowing the material to be added to wikipedia verbatim without such proof because i am protecting the schools copyright. the simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to wikipedia and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute wikipedias content is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released,0

7690,7690,i would be glad to noformation. a conflict of interest is defined as where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of wikipedia. the aims of wikipedia is to produce a neutral reliably sourced encyclopedia. my position is that editors from the rationalskeptic wikiproject and their ilk are not neutral in this subject and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture no specialist dedicated learning in it have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature and they are illequiped to provide a full rounded mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.now as for myself i will tell it straight i work hours per week in acupuncture practice earning $ per hour. acupuncture practice is not my main source of income in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. it requires hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline and one day i aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.i refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified have the most experience have done the most study and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of coi. in fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable far more valuable than the input of ivorytower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical critical and dismissive point of view. in fact considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page which emulates the tone of those quackwatch websites that proliferate on the web these days and considering their devoted following of edzard ernst and their elevation of his work as the number source on the page literally and their transparent agenda of debunking the pseudoscience they consider acupuncture to be it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are advancing outside interests rather than being neutral and thus they in breach of coi as opposed to i. ,0

7698,7698, recuplex hello tungilikunfortunately you cannot even tough you work and have access information at the city of north battleford because no original research says original research used on wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts allegations and ideas—for which no reliable published sources exist which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per general notability guideline.make sure that your sources must be reliable if you want to know if a source is reliable. wpsource says a source material must have been published the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. unpublished materials are not considered reliable you can use universitylevel textbooks books published by respected publishing houses magazines journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. never use blogs as sources as wpnewsblog says never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. for personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.wikipedia strongly prefer free files wherever possible. when no free file exist it sometimes to ask a permission to use a nonfree copyrightprotected file under the fair use provision. ideally most free files should be uploaded to wikimedia commons instead of wikipedia. in uploading images only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. now you first find out whether the image is legal in the united states where the wikipedia servers are located also if the image has not been released to your knowledge under a license and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. next if youre finish determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.in the procedure of uploading it you can upload an image by using the upload file link on the left side of the main page under toolbox. use good filenames because some filenames such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras are disallowed and attempting to use them will generate an error message.example of good file names imagecity of london skyline from london city hall oct sir john betjeman .jpgexample of bad file names i hope this helps in improving your article i know it is a little bit complicated but you can ask questions at the teahouse with more experienced editors in the wiki. good luck ,0

7711,7711,dear sir i do not know what moderators you are talking about but i would likely be one of them and the last time i heard the administrative corps and particularly myself had an extremely low tolerance for nationalist revertwarriors. maps are maps. the last time i heard they are geographic tools not political ones and it makes zero sense for the article itself to state armenia is part of southeast asia and then for the map to show it as part of europe. if you actually come up with some reliable sources that place armenia inside europe i will be thrilled. until then kindly stop revertwarring and trying to bully dbachmann like you managed to bully others above the alternative is to get pagebanned under wparbaa. thank you. ,0

7818,7818, further tidy up required the lead paragraph says that this is a list of major hospitals in karachi. i have discussed the list with a colleague who did her medical training in karachi. she says that the public institutions are major hospitals and that most of the dental surgeries are not. she went through the list of private institutions and marked the ones she knew to be major unfortunately i cant do anything to the article based on her list as that would be wpor. i havent deleted any of the institutions and we really need someone who has the time and reads urdu to go through the list and look for sources. i have tidied up the mixture of bold and nonbold text and have removed addresses where i could. i have also heavily cut the dental surgeries to just the three that appear to be hospitals. ,0

7821,7821,hello gerardw. if you click on forsenas contribution list and review the edit summaries it is hard to believe that hes patiently seeking consensus on kosovo matters. for instance removing data from albanian extermist vandal member angelo de la paz. in particular look at this edit of battle of kosovo where forsena goes against all the cited references and actually removes most of them. on the matter of disputed country versus disputed region if angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first it would be worrisome. though your point about the balkan topic ban is noted since forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced it is too soon to give him credit for following it. the announcement that he was under digwuren restrictions on january seems to have had no effect at all on his edits. i will leave angelo a note that his editing was discussed here.,0

7834,7834, cleanup urgently needed urgent request for wikipedia admin to cleanup this article either stick to the facts or delete article. the ronald ryan article is full of alleged unproven hearsay ... ryan said that ryan did that ryan admitted to that ryan confessed to that ryan told him/her this and that. all these unproven stories are most unprofessional and unethical as are the personal opinions/views of certain named people. these are simply not the facts why are the referenced facts on ryan continually being vandalized altered manipulated and often deleted by userpurrum and replaced with unproven madeup allegations? fact is that what ryan is alleged to have said to whom has never been proven confirmed nor recorded there is no evidence anywhere the facts are that there was a total lack of scientific ballistic forensic evidence to prove ryan guilty. the factual serious ambiguities in the case the factual dire inconsistencies of all eyewitnesses evidence the missing pieces of vital evidence that also could not be scientifically tested the fact that only patersons one single fired shot was heard by all persons. and the most unusual pleas by jury members not to execute ryan maybe they had second thoughts about ryans guilt. finally the fact that the public heard brosnans comments on abc australia national radio in ... i dont know whos shot killed who ... which should have put an end to all the unproven allegations still being made about ryan confessing guilt. brosnan clearly stated that he did not know whos bullet killed who. thgey were brosnans own words on national radio and he never said ryan confessed guilt at all.... ,0

7867,7867,show n tella question for it may seem an odd question to wp purists but considering the importance wp places on reliability of secondary sources why does wp not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves? the entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation. for all i know i could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented mind gameplaying geek living in inner mongolia. it is imperative in my mind that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence as i have of their actual ability credibility reliability accountability... their authority to control. if its required of the sources it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them. similarly how do i call for consensus? who may be a member and how is each identified? thanks in advance... thats the beauty of wikipedia. anyone can edit it. thats the point. you have no more authority than any other editor here regardless of your credentials. also anyone can participate when trying to achieve consensus. just remember its not the number of people but the strength or the arguments that matter. darian ,0

7870,7870,hi eric no. you are not in any way one of the people i was talking about. you just got caught in the crossfire and if i made you think i was thinking of you i apologise. your work is consistent good plus even more importantly you have a sensitivity to other peoples work with a few people dont. you build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. the people i was talking about arrive at an article chop it around change meanings change context spelling capitalisation and then move on more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. for example one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles frequently changes it to taoiseachs a nonexistent word. he has tried to change governorsgeneral to governorgenerals prime minister to prime minister. he changed links from president of ireland to president of ireland links to the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ie the form of uk between and to united kingdom of great britain and ireland so linking the reference to the wrong uk. he mucked up some links to tánaiste deputy irish prime minister by lowercasing it changed a series of mentions of first lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady changed one mention of garret fitzgerald to garrett fitzgerald removed the word óg from gearóid og fitzgerald and mór from gearóid mór fitzgerald not grasping that they actually were two different people mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father óg meaning small meant his son and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. that is just some of my work he has mucked up. he made a complete mess of some biology articles reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author one of the worlds top mediæval historians quick wiki in disgust. i know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. and there are quite a few such people. not a lot but enough to mangle everything they touch. another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in th century history on the basis of google searches. i checked on google. the majority of articles said he was right. those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. but she treated google as sacrosanct. if a google search said it it was gospel. i have had political science articles which i have written and which were based on hard fact in mediocre garbage applying wrong capitalisation again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays wrong spelling wrong interpretation etc. i wasnt reacting simply to the droop quota at all that was the sixth article that day i had done that had been hit. in that case michael hardy as he is prone to do swept in to a topic he knows little about changed capitalisation text and even the formula which is the standard dq formula taught in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula. that intervention was classic michael go onto a page about a topic he doesnt know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that unilaterally change it in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.american english and british english use different approaches to capitalisation. many of the references were to things only found outside the us and so capitalised. instead he insisted on applying us capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the us. that indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. apart from its general unreliability most website mentions in the us are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply us capitalisation to things that dont exist in the us and are capitalised internationally. a classic example is the electoral system proportional representation using the single transferable vote. michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. isnt used in the us and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system and lowercased when used generically. where it is mentioned on google it is largely on the basis of americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit american english. so michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation then another us user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the us. so any nonamerican user would get r,0

7876,7876,thank you not sure how else to contact you. hope you dont mind me posting here. thank you for reviewing my unblock request. i appreciate your taking the time to examine the issue in order to make what i needless to say think was a fair judgment.as i already expressed on the talk page prior to the day block its proven futile for me to try to maintain the agreed version pending revision through further discussion and consensus as my efforts to undo the reverts of people who refuse to make any kind of effort to discuss their objections on talk continually well twice prior to this day thing which doesnt count on this point result in me getting blocked. thus as i said on talk im going to stick with helping get his rewrite ready. i hope admins will continue to monitor the six day war article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensusforming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions etc. if you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard i would appreciate it. and its probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. i trust my decision to let other editors whom i discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed versions will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me. i just want to see this article improved including by keeping it in compliance with wpnpov. thanks again. cheers.,0
7877,7877,i keep wondering why you coming here arguing with me when you make no sense at all? dont you realize that many people might be coming to see this discussion here? you are basically telling everyone here not to trust the cia bbc united nations chart that is posted above which is also posted at bbc and that everyone should trust your map which was made by an unknown person. first of all i am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. i never changed the numbers rather i changed and replaced the old hard to read and understand map of yours. my map the one above explains little more about each ethnic group while yours does not. demographics of afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. by watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in afghanistans article there must be something you are up to. also something i noticed you keep talking about the numbers of pashtuns should be lower which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. i will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. i wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as i find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. you keep reminding that pashtuns killed this pashtuns killed that why dont you discuss about pashtuns always being killed by invaders. they have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. this law is practiced in all the countries of the world. by now ive already realized that you are not just a traitor to afghanistan but also a true enemy of pashtuns. i have allah almighty god on my side and thats why i always win.,0

7910,7910,that actually sounds quite reasonable. keep in mind that ive been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway offwikipedia before i was blocked.its refreshing to see some true civility for a change. especially after having had four different admins block me actually its probably more than the last four without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so. then theres the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smokefilled back room.duk and haukur were decent and know more about what theyre talking about because weve been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past even ive locked horns with both of them at various times weve managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings cant say that for everyone else involved.mostly however what ive much of anything not even remotely resembling civility in this entire process. at least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized magicincantation wikipediajargon meaning of that term. its no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it it has nothing whatsoever to do with realworld concepts of civility as they use it.your proposal was so much in a different vein that it catches me by surprise. the fact that i am surprised might be a cause for concern.,0

7919,7919, more on wiki writers many errors have been corrected in wikipedias roman salute article. the article had many visits from dr. curry in the past see its talk page as dr. curry attempted to correct the many errors.however the wikipedia article on the roman salute is becoming more dishonest by the week. an earlier version referenced the work of professor rex curry and started thusly the roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight with palms down. sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. the salute was supposed to have been used in the roman republic but there is no clear evidence of this. indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in roman culture by paul barlow. a more recent version of the same article is written as if a neonazi has been coveringup again.a big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase roman salute and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.the article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of dr. curry conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the roman republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in roman culture.the wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient rome. there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of roman images. there is as much evidence that after dr. currys shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted roman images in order to coverup and suppress professor currys discoveries. the wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient rome. there is no support for the idea that the roman salute concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of roman images. there is as much evidence that after dr. currys shocking discoveries about the salutes origin with the pledge of allegiance modern writers including wiki writers deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to coverup and suppress professor currys discoveries. for example there is no evidence that jacqueslouis david actually thought that his painting the oath of the horatii represented an actual historical roman salute. all of the evidence indicates that david created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. all of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. the intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by dr. curry further the horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.the tennis court oath was painted by david later and repeats davids use of the dramatic gesture that david concocted but in a more modern setting. there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. david was not there. further the oath was was written on paper the paper being read by the central figure? and the oath was taken by signing the document. there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting the central figure might be swearing or he might be reading his document while those people about him waive hats talk holler point etc. three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the horatii painting. the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.the distribution of the eagle standards was painted by david even later and repeats davids use of the dramatic gesture that david concocted but in another modern setting. there is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all. the wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings. that painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oathtaking or at all and simply shows various people with various gestures acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for and shouting for the eagle standards. the wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.the wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straightarm g,0

7925,7925, four years after writing my vision is that wikipedia should not say e is a fool when all it can really say is that d has called e a fool lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article. the preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the eucharist in last supper and cites the catholic catechism and orthodox encyclopedia and an anglican bishop. reading the footnotes one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis. and instead of reproducing quotes faithfully or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors without even selective quotation.on the positive side im learning a lot about eucharistnot from this wikipedia article i have to say as much as running down footnotesi never knew the eucharist was announced before the last supper until i read in the catholic catechism. that tidbit doesnt appear in any wikipedia article i read.the last supper is the institution of the eucharist to catholic not the origin according to the catholic catechism cited here from .yet you couldnt tell it from our little article ,0

7948,7948,some of these things i have already changed or deleted. a province really does not have a monetary policy though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash and the phrase was too general to begin with so thats gone. i changed did nothing to stop to did not work to stop though your criticism is valid. note however that when de la rúa took office argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. then came the corralito etc. on the whole the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the imf were recommending them. i dont remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. note also that economic collapse doesnt refer only to the critical period november february but to the whole recessive period and some time before and after. we should agree on a phrase that links de la rúas measures with the crisis without falling into any of... did not work to stop the economic collapse.... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.... ultimately caused the economic collapse.... were intended to cause the economic collapse. ... had nothing to do with the economic collapse then the importdependent thing. consider this right after the devaluation neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. the public hospital where i worked initially could not get xray film from the providers and then only by paying in cash and in dollars. argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. id say thats rather importdependent though we may be speaking of different things. what do you propose?whats the problem with the religious aspects of the supreme justices? the previous justices were all old male and ideologically conservative and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the catholic church. and now two of them are women one is the president of the court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. the clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the supreme court were really important. argibays atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. in a country where the church attacks anyone who dares speak of womens rights having these two women at the top of one of the countrys government branches is extremely significant.the qualification historical for the payment to the imf is that correct me if im wrong argentina had never decided to pay so much to the imf or anyone else not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule and this payment has redefined the relationship of argentina with the imf and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment.im glad were discussing this here civilly. understand that noone here is that i know affiliated with a party or a person if someone is it doesnt show and that we dont have an ideological police or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic you have to consider that most of the content is settled already and should be treated carefully to avoid being or being seen as disruptive. its perfectly ok for us to discuss over the tiniest details here.please sign after your comments and replies here using four tildes . when you save the page theyll be converted to your username and current date/time. its easier to keep track that way. talk ,0

7961,7961,thom hartmann states that in germany ... people fill in handmarked ballots which are handcounted by civil servants watched over by volunteer representatives of the political parties. ... its totally clean and easily audited. and even though it takes a week or more to count the vote ... the german people know the election results the night the polls close because the news media’s exit polls for two generations have never been more than a tenth of a percent off.unfortunately hes wrong. generally all votes are counted twice by midnight. then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not. they have a week to reply and then the final results are announced its got nothing to do with counting votes for a week btw. the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other. this year a candidate died in dresden after the ballots had been finalised and therefore the precinct voted two weeks? later,0
