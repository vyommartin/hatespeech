6012~i wonder what would be your npov version of the following article muslims believe that muhammad was the last prophet and messenger of the monotheistic abrahamic tradition and that the quran is the last revelation of god. muslims also believe that after quran and muhammad there will be no guidance from god. in the quran muhammad is referred to as the seal of the prophets or the last prophet.followers of mani founder of the persian faith manichaeism believe that these titles the seal of the prophets and the last prophet are attributed to mani who his followers claim came before muhammad.ive bolded the statements that makes it npov. now tell me how it compromises npov. if you are so much concerned with npov then why are you reverting to usedbooks version? i have asked him to cite sources of his claim and he didnt do so. ~0

6035~first i just realized via your question that i could answer here. assuming it saves.yes i finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary? i confess i did not at first even this morning.i realize i made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way. i would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies.what to do differently when groups go after me? write a better wikiquette name several people? go to wpani naming several people? do userrfcs naming several people? that is where i admit i need further advice. since a . year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it i dont know how to defend the recurrent references to it. let me say again it was a stupid overly generalized and exaggerated response but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent. i feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents/issues/etc or stating in detail my current views would be inappropriate even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different pov. but if theres some policy on this that i missed i sure wish people would help me out with that.~0

6046~hello zwack gb and welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions.i notice that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. in other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article. your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. to reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. to start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other. if the page you created has already been deleted from wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.the one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. it is also worth noting that wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. if your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.if you are stuck and looking for help please come to the new contributors help page where experienced wikipedians can answer any queries you have you can also just type on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. here are a few other good links for newcomersthe five pillars of wikipediahow to edit a pagehelp pagestutorialhow to write a great articlemanual of stylei hope you enjoy editing here and being a wikipedian please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes this will automatically produce your name and the date. if you have any questions check out wikipediawhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page. again welcome~0

6054~ november utcit seems that either you do not understand either you are of bad faith. lets make it simpleaccording to encyclopaedia judaica jerusalem not i the great argument of the reform rabbis in frankfurt was god ordered circumcision to abraham not to moses in other words gods commandment to abraham is circumcision gods commandments to moses do not order circumcision in other words gods one commandment to abraham = circumcision. gods ten commandments to moses = not even one for circumcisionthe rabbis not i said so therefore wholly and seriously documented i wrote it into the main article but wp and s rub it out. this is an insane violation of the wiki rules.now in order to enlighten the main article the nd commandment topic of this discussion introduces my discovery a child would do it. it says gods nd commandment to moses orders him do not circumcise.but contrary to the saying of pw and s i never attributed this to the reform rabbis.conclusion who forgot to take their medicine for several days now? not ithe ethical question involved about this discussion is how can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia? think about it if you are responsible persons you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers which i am doing.sigis request to wp and s circumcise your heart eyes ears and pen not your peco because yes this criminal violation of moses nd commandment is being done every day in the usa to baby boys. it even has been done to an oregon girl in see books – the rape of innocence indeed a good american mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it can she? friendly your sigismond ~0

6064~ i...butter is a butter substitute the references given see discussion on this above on this are improperly given. what is given appears to be little more than a google screen scrape. i managed to find both references and they do not support this usage. the use in these publications is not to define but to indicate the broad category. peanut butter if placed in the category of a nut butter is also in the category if butter substitute but it is not a type of margarine which is what this product is. possibly it might be helpful to say that the product is commonly used to substitute butter but it doesnt help in the basic definiton. ~0
6065~for the record i was serious about running in the rfa. i was not trolling or disrupting i was advised that i should run in the rfa to see how it was like and i did so. there should have been more questions during the rfaif there was any questions about sincerity. the rfa was not a joke it was serious. i feel i should have been made an admin and then would have been the better example. i felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the rfa even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the rfa. as i am truely afraid shocked and dismayed at the admins response.as it seems now there is a new rule if the admin feel you are faking your rfa they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith.~0
6066~ september utci love how i specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission. your line response was the equivalent of nananana booboo as far as i am concerned. lets dissect these lines.you dont understand propaganda.that is a loaded statement if i ever read one. i have read up on the term propaganda thanks very much and my readings are not simply limited to this website which i feel is narrow in its scope. i have been on a program that toured the death camps of poland and studied the use of propaganda in nazi germany. i am currently awaiting a response from a phd who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry and it is with respect to our point of contention here. funny i cant find any work you have done on this subject mr. jensen yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. i have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. you use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.i am not denouncing advertising for products i consider harmful and this is what you need to understand because i have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. this statement you have just made is a personal attack. additionally it is incorrect. i dont consider the product to be harmful. it is harmful. this is not an opinion but a restating of facts by the iarc/who and health organizations worldwide based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. if it were simply an opinion i can understand why you could be frustrated. but the irony mr. jensen is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer among other health risks please take the time i urge you to read any or all of the references i quoted in my submission all from established medical journals. the industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant says that uv exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed not proven whatsoever and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven e.g. cancer prevention base tan exaggerated and can be achieved through safer means e.g. vitamin d exposure. so please enlighten me mr jensen as to what propaganda is? is propaganda not a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?. thats the definition on the wiki page right? i am sure you have head of a systematic review that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. it is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. well thats what i use and thats what the world health organization used when they came to an unbiased conclusion that uv exposure from tanning beds as well as the sun is a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes. in my submission i think i clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points including the systematic reviews i mention. is this not the same as presenting one side of an argument to influence the attitude of the community? or is it that as you say i just dont understand propaganda? i have to say it yet again to you because i think this is such an important point that i have to drive home this is not my opinion. tanning beds cause more harm than good fact. tanning industry sites present the good which is partly true and negate the bad partly false and this is also a fact. if you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of good business its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product and the result is advertising that is propaganda. the industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics e.g. suggesting that cancer society and neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children blaming o~0
6067~many thanks for checking and investigating. it is a shame theres nothing more recent. from p of curatolo diagnosic criteria i getthe rate of occurrence of tuberous sclerosis at birth is unknown...paragraph continues with stats trying to come up with a figure... this indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as webb et al. cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis arch dis child –earlier when talking about hunt and lindenbaums study he says the scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be. i dont have that paper so dont have more details.an editorial by fryer journal of the royal society of medicine says ... suggesting a birth incidence of . i dont have the osborne paper you mention. ive seen mentioned but dont know its source at present.my sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. im happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.the list of prevalence figures throughout the years comes from curatolo table . page . this in turn is based on an earlier table by shepherd in his short chapter the epidemiology of tuberous sclerosis complex in the book gomez . the earlier table doesnt have the ocallaghan figure.ill see if i can get hold of some of the other papers but it isnt easy. °talk ~0

6073~thanks for the reply but i made the suggestion to the editor of the board but he would not listen or even discuss the issue i have stated that the editor has maintained his own personal views into the article. the editor stated i should go and seek this dispute resolution because as far as he is concerned he doesnt want anything that he doesnt agree with on articles linked to sikhism which i deem very one sided and a bit intolerant. thanks i would like this issue sorted i have offered to create an orthodox and unorthodox section on diet in sikhism i have presented the same scholars that where in the original article that the editor cited himself yet when i cited the same scholars to show that they themselves agree that their are passages against meat and many sects against it the current editor of diet in sikhism again took it off. how can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesnt fit in with his own pov which he stated as only being orthodox. i know wiki also has information on shia unorthodox sect of islam does that mean we only adhere to one persons view on sikhism when that person has cited sholars that openly admit that their are passages against meat if that is the case then why cant relevant verses be shown? thanks again i only reponded on here because to be honest im getting lost with all the forms on ~0

6079~untitledalso see infobox vote codes and minor state please stop since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there. is algeria minor? iran? its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted. as for making ma a country code for western sahara its not. ma is a code for morocco and so it is in moroccos infobox. eh was created for western sahara so that is its country code. as far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the united nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places. ❤t☮c☺m☯ it does not need a definition to be in the article. a minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council ... etc. as to the eh domain it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for ws but it is not assigned .ma being the one used in the territory. the same thing applies for the currency the mad is the currency of morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. the same thing goes for the iac the time zone + utc etc. they are the ones used in the territory. these things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. as to your ridiculous claim of the un considering the territory as occupied i already explained to you the difference between a un position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in of the algeriancuban drafted document that has no obligation on the un. the zionism=racism example is the brightest one for you to understand it. i will revert to the version that was in use before the anon ip started this mess. it does since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense. what states that .ma is being used in the territory? do you have any evidence of this at all? the same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. to ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards. western sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states im not going through this with you again. ❤t☮c☺m☯ ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. minor states is indeed a value judgement although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena algeria is not a big newsmaker per se. but in the interest of neutrality merely noting african asian and latin american states seems reasonable. at the same time if koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. same standards on language. evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in western sahara provinces using .ma. it is trivially easy to find that. koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding. what is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in western sahara? « d. trebbien talk may utc good question. since effectively all internet service to the western sahara is via maroc telecom or other moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in moroccan territory exws provinces largely in the casarabat area. technically i am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service. presumably the regional investment office of laayoune may have its server physically in laayoune. other similar offices may also. it strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the moroccan address .ma. polisario partisans may not like that but its effective reality. country codes i find it reasonable th~0
6080~i see that this debate has in any case been preempted by userkotniski who has created and populated the categoryconstituent countries of the united kingdom. in my opinion this is unacceptable as the debate is still in progress indeed it has barely begun and the new category name has the rejected term constituent countries and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main articles name countries of the united kingdom and the term found in most other relevant articles. personally i dont see why wales et al should not be categoried as european countries. i am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here. this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the proper and logical alternative i.e. countries of the united kingdom if the need for it is proven and accepted. ~0
6081~editing edits on wiki improve by evolution only the best survives. they become best by change after change after change. i find i make two kinds of edits. ones which add content and ones which improve language. i fancy i am quite good at writing smooth prose but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. if i have a fact to insert or point to make the primary thing is to make or insert it. then someone else can smooth it along or i may do so myself when i have more time or after leaving the piece and rereading it. it can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go because you do not spot your mistakes. as to our last exchange in severus snape yes i agree i put in a clumsy statement but i was trying to express a particular point. you improved the flow but slightly altered my point. i changed it again back a little to my original intention though you also added something. cheers.~0

6090~respect for medicaidi have to have alot of respect and admiration for the medicaid system here in new york. im a client of a medicaid managed care health plan through capital district physicians health plan. my plan is the result of a contract between cdphp and the ny medicaid system. standard practice here is placing medicaid clients in managed care plans through health insurance companies run by the state. i like my managed care plan. i was without any health care insurance for almost eight years without medicaid and my medicaid managed care plan id be worse off. better than nothing isnt it?oh the name of my plan is cdphp select plan the plan cdphp runs for medicaid clients in my county and several other nearby counties.~0

6099~thanks hi davidthanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at talkdepoprovera. and for reminding me its guy fawkesi feel that i dont need to assure you that i will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re pfizer/lacroix/bmd in the current disputebut just in case please be assured that i will not. it might actually be helpful to have other people than mastcell and i making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere as well if not enough editors contribute in a week or two weeks time.i will be slowtorespond/disengaged on the depo talkpage in hopes of keeping things cool while still continuing to advance the discussion. there is no hurry and deadline after all.i dont know if youve been following the discussion at emergency contraception but mastcells first post to depo occurred less than minutes after the conclusion of this exchange . it seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking but it also seems to me that he arrived at depo already quite upset/confrontational etc. because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e. he is angry re ec page and following me to depo and dalkon shield to express animosity i think it is better that the depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.remember remember ~0
6100~matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title. witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics ashkenazi hebrew cantonese linguistics american english sephardi hebrew etc etc... arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or arvanitika language are out of the question. i dont want to use arvanitika albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title. therefore the only options are arvanitic or arvanitika. they can and should be used. arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used. what is wrong with it? it is neutral. it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica etc aree wrong. macedonian and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect. if britannica or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such. no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. why should they be treated as such. every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title. arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies. what unesco britannica etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor. i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will. are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english? no so stop that straw man argument. arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy. the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia. we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them. regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies? that is what you are asking me to do~0

6170~ndpaffiliatedi added a fact tag to the fourtimesreinserted modifier ndpaffiliated to the mention of bill tieleman other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty nor are publishers such as canwest which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the bc liberal party also one of the partys major financial contributors. its not that tieleman isnt an ndper but his credentials go beyond his ndp politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party also. im responding partly also to this edit by . ive puzzled long and hard over my own realworld coi on bc political articles but i see no reason to recuse myself from participation in bc political articles though generally i give them as wide a berth as possible but when i recognize pov political activity/wording as a responsible wikipedian i cant not say something about it or challenge the povism and coi/spin edits when i see them. my interest here is to prevent wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine of any party and to make sure wikipedia principles are observed particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect wikipedia guidelines or concepts like wpnpov. in the case of this item about bc rail theres lots missing including the search of the clarkmarrissen home during the opening of the investigation and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case. but theres also lots of other commentators particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like sean holman laila yuile and bc mary who have similarly spoken out about clarks involvement in the bc rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public and of the informed media. she may have been out of teh way for the hst fracas and the big media have pronounced her clean of that but he big media also have maintained a veil of silence over bc rail. the current text says that she resigned for family reasons but its wellcitable that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the bc rail affair. and about the tieleman thing unless every time conservativeaffiliated columnists or bc liberalaffiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims often false its not fair to single out tieleman for this thats the reason for the cite tag tielemans own byline says only bill tieleman is one of bcs best known communicators political commentators and strategists. bill writes a politics column tuesdays in hours newspaper and the tyee online magazine. bill has been communications director in the b.c. premiers office and at the bc federation of labour. bill owns west star communications a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour business nonprofits and government. and frankly seeing whats going on with the ndp and teh things the party council/james supporter types have been calling him he may not be ndpaffiliated much longer.... ~0

6223~note from the subject bookśrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta«and he did not have to flatter anyone support anyone or manage anyones life. his mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. he saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. despite his advanced age he felt that he had barely begun his work. yet he felt confident. he had his vision of a world association of devotees. it was not an idle dream although he was not certain how it would all come about. but he knew his duty. for the present he would go on describing his vision the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters in articles and books. but as soon as possible he should go to the west. westerners he had concluded were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding more than his fellow indians they would be open to the message of the absolute truth. he knew he should go. and he would goif kṛṣṇa desired.abhay lived frugally in vṛndāvana keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. he carefully kept a ledger just as if he were running a substantial business even though his purchases were only a little milk a few vegetables charcoal for cooking bus rides and his major expenditure postage.abhay composed a bengali poem vṛndāvanabhajana. its opening stanzas were especially selfreflective and personal.i am sitting alone in vṛndāvanadhāma.in this mood i am getting many realizations.i have my wife sons daughters grandsons everythingbut i have no money so they are a fruitless glory.kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material natureby his strength it has all become tasteless to me today.yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye taddhanaṁ śanaiḥi gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom i am merciful. how was i able to understand this mercy of the allmerciful?»śrīla prabhupāda is here in the advanced age of – his supporters friends and family left him broke.śrīla prabhupādalīlāmṛta another reference«prabhupādas most ambitious literary undertaking the completion of śrīmadbhāgavatam was to be no less than sixty volumes. he had begun in india in and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. now kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing vedic literatures and for travelling and he was working at an amazing pace.»prabhupāda is here in advanced age of starting to write his bhaktivedanta purports – i guess in india it was an advanced age but not in florida.~0

6276~wikipediarequestsforcomment/historyandgeographythe following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. i trust that you will do the same phil. talkrossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam. these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed. one external link links to an article about the th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood. another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. it seems to me that this philip gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for rfa is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam. id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr. gronowski. i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. thank you very much for your consideration. ~0

6309~ no im not ranting. and youre tautology about if theyre editing against the sanction they will be sanctioned is both laughable and irrelevant. im interested in editorial behavior and effect. and the odds are vanishingly slim you are even as remotely qualified as i am to have an opinion in these kinds of matters. keep mashing buttons and your eye off the big picture. ~0
6310~i understand the confusion. you would think that since a primary source is a firsthand account it would be the most reliable. however the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. also there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. thats when a secondary source comes in. a secondary sources author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion evaluation and/or conclusion. furthermore secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. it helps us avoid original research. one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions whether intentionally or not which would be considered original research. you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wprs and wpsource. ~0
6311~you have communicated about this matter on my talk page rather than on the articles where this discussion belongs. before you take it thereif you wish to do soplease be aware that you are using the term weasel word improperly. i see that this has been brought to your attention before and that nonetheless your misue of the term continues. and again to repeat myself from the edit summary your correctiondespite tarantinos statements many solutions to this unexplained postmodern puzzle as dubbed by one scholar have been proposedis grammatically improper. it also demonstrates a tin ear. your contributions may be in good faith but they are hardly positive. that is the reason they are being reverted and no other. ~0

6336~delete example?would it be appropriate to delete the example section at the bottom? mar utci think so dont see what it adds. mar utcyes. moreover it is not an example of random variable. its just a realization of random variable. hardly misleading. mar utci thought this was very useful because it showed an example where the map was not the identity map. i propose putting it back. false statementa continuous random variable does not always have a density. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... definitioni dont like the definition here not that im letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting but could this be considered a clearer definition?random variablethe outcome of an experiment need not be a number for example the outcome when a coin is tossed can be heads or tails. however we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. a random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. the value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.there are two types of random variable discrete and continuous.a random variable has either an associated probability distribution discrete random variable or probability density function continuous random variable.i think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.s which are neither discrete nor continuous for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type the current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. the above definition is far better on both counts and so i will put it on the page. btw sorry about the no summary edit i hit the enter key accidentally. examples a coin is tossed ten times. the random variable x is the number of tails that are noted. x can only take the values ... so x is a discrete random variable. a light bulb is burned until it burns out. the random variable y is its lifetime in hours. y can take any positive real value so y is a continuous random variable. i think the above definition for the original reference pls search via google explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value rather like a numeric index to a database record. this would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. the earler wikiedia definition led me to comment on another wikipedia definition incorrectly because i think i may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this wikipedia definition.a random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. this examplejust assigns another event to an event. could we change it to something likeconsider a game where if a is rolled on a fair sixsided die player wins and otherwise player wins. let x represent the number of times player wins. thenandor maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? what do you think? this section should begin with a sentence of the form a random variable is .... to avoid this is to show that you don~0

6348~an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the passover holiday. the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover according to tradition.some jews currently live in iran. the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years. while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. so seems to be the way to go. ~0

6402~hi how are you today? ive been looking over your fetal alcohol work and its pretty sharp. my dads a doc and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that he looked at it too. good work.so yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy. im not looking to out anyone or anyhting its just gotten to the point that well i think theres a reason and other people too to read about this fascinating community activist. i was telling will beback ive been a memebr of sierra club since i was akid my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life and ive done the same wiht my own children. its a cool way to move things forward like that movie but hoefulyl much less trite. anyhow.. whats the good word with you today? i think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog punching in before they set out to undermine one another. because thats whats happening here im actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. look over at biff rose there was a flargrant violation of the rr standard and i pointed out that to will beback that each time i made that violation i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know ive got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip to follow up on as i told will you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you cant just block an article because true information is being disseminated through it. well you can but its against the wiki rules and so you are in violation though i dont really think you care anyhow hope you keep your head above water and il lsee you at the fights so to speak. have a good day ill remain civil as long as you do.. but you ve got to remain civil in your actions too ok? ok.~0

6423~controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip. in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology. in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around. so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy. mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw. i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw. rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means. i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for. however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine. the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines. the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable. agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines. the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips. just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that.what i suggest is a compromise. i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or. mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use. do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated? without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage. im thinking something like this....clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however mw defines it as such.this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated. i think this is fair. note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here. im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly. ~0

6477~i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article theres a problem. either the history and characteristics should be expanded of the list should be culled. i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between and others...myself included. we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples. there we did trappist abbey and foreign. foreign includes all nonbelgium examples. this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia not a list. people can find lists anywhere and the article should reference this. also the style statistics are bad. when you say style statistics it sounds like a prescription not a description. an encyclopedia should follow the latter and if the former is used a citation should follow...and youll not find a valid one for this style in its country of origin.~0

6489~this is the closest thing in to any statement about the irs in that articlethe copeland ministry declined requests for an interview and pointed to an accounting firms declaration that all jet travel complies with federal tax laws.. do you all see the same thing i see? the statement that according to irs officials are in strict compliance is nowhere at all in the cited news article. all the news article says is that an accounting firm declared that all jet travel complies with federal tax laws. this is very different than what is stated as fact in the article.an accounting firm is not irs officials.~0

6491~im back. i already created id occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class c when i do i collected a massive number of diff edits on balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is on record getting blocked for saying this about greeks under a previous handle. not to mention his personal talk page is one big antigreek rant fest pointing to questionable fyrom news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titlesno assfuckers has a nice ring to it d use it as a pejorative term. i was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin futper and a few others e.g. macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antigreek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking im going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. as for the current naming disputing article... i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i dont think that reduces the existential threat to greece. communism fell years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left. there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately. i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasnt greek i didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didnt think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. assuming you see it as relevant yourself of coursefebruary the fyroms president kirov gligorov at an interview by the foreign information service daily report easten europe stated we are slavs who came to the region in the sixth century. we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians.january the fyroms ambassador in washington d.c. mrs. ljubica acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great. we are slavs and we speak a slavic language. greece is the fyroms second largest trading partner and its number one investor.february the fyrom.s ambassador to canada gyordan veselinov in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great. we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian. there is some confusion about our identity.i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior. he directly contradicts fyroms own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognitionprime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan who claims to be related to alexander the great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient macedonians. and dont get me started on that incident where gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of united macedonia was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article~0

6500~this is ridiculous. the user im speaking to also said i was being disingenuous. why dont you ask him to focus on the content as well? i took the initiative to start a discussion with someone who contested the content that i was adding to the article yet he didnt want me to address him. then whats the whole point of the talk page in the first place? who else do i address? this is really getting ridiculous.~0

6510~ about your comment on elaragirls talk page hello dev i couldnt help but notice your comments on talk page under the heading esperanza so im sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy or elaragirls. i wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with esperanza and some editors how shall i say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others. as for the governance issue i personally dont understand the current structure and i dont feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.i still think that an offwikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on esperanzas page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on wikipedia. whats one more click of the mouse? just so you know i had participated a little in the coffee lounge but i got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which i felt were sexist offensive and not at all belonging on wikipedia. because i had participated only to a limited extent my overall edit count as of wasnt seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.i had proposed a hypothetical merger between esperanza the kindness campaign and concordia and while i still think that many of their stated goals overlap i also feel that esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. i was unaware that esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. if you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant chalk it up to my own shortsightedness not to esperanza as a whole.i know that we may differ in our views of what to do with esperanza but at least the mfd and in particular comments by you elaragirl and others have given the impetus for esperanza to examine itself. thank you for that.since ive typed this much i might as well invite you to review me at editor review. thanks again for your participation in all of this. ~0

6514~the list i could agree on though being on a un list per se is not really notworthy they list everything. i mean gibraltar is on a /ton/ of lists most likely economical lists literacy lists monkey population lists....the un is big on stats. that the un declares it to be none self governing is probably interesting enough to mention though i imagine there is some comment from gibraltar on the matter we can include. while i have no problem with the popular culture section being trimmed i should say that adding new info in isnt as much a problem but merging other articles back into an oversized article is just folly. it does mean we should look at splintering some section off. talk • ~0

6524~i accept your comment in the spirit in which it is offered. terminology matters and it can be hard to find the correct word. it was another editor who sought to distinguish civilised behaviour from that of indians my point was that even if one accepts such a distinction nonindians have committed absurdly large atrocities. in addition i could have pointed to the mystic massacre as a completely onpoint example of a butchery that shocked our native population. nonetheless both tribal mongols and tribal american indians had or have civilizations by any reasonable definition. ~0

6530~discussion boards are almost the lowest form of life on wprs only just above comments sections on blogs. however if you can demonstrate that glf has written this and the fact that it has appeared under his name on a forum that he has moderating rights on may indicate this although he does not use a stared account which means it could be an imposter. the daily mirror account seems to be totally derivative of the guardian and the guardian does not say that glf was a member of the bnp just that their journalist contacted him and he said that he could not be active. the daily mirror could well have lost the subtelty of what the guardian said i wouldnt like to be their libel lawyer on that with all of this and knowing glfs propensity to sue i am going to cut this out. the fact that the cda is to the right of the conservative party is pretty well established in the article. ~0

6532~i think we need to write to debretts david williamson is now dead to ask if they actually had sight of the letters patent otherwise i would find it hard to accept their assertion. it would effectively mean that his eldest daughter had a fundamental right to call herself and be referred to in all legal documents as baroness or lady home of berwick. but in fact there is not one document notably her testament that i can find that refers to them as such. merely as his daughters with the honorific lady because they were daughters of an earl. in addition debretts cannot settle these issues. did alec douglashome make a claim in the house for that peerage to be added to his stable? because that seems to be what theyre saying. frankly i would treat such a suggestion with disbelief.~0

6612~for what its worth i suggest you refrain from pushing the socks remarks around as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. given that an spi has been opened and checkuser denied due to stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone it serves no purpose to accuse him further just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. no one is going to win that type of argument. also i suggest you stop calling cowboy jake from now on as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. clearly he is determined to push his case and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. but if you give them enough rope theyll eventually hang themselves with it. challenging suspected socks nonstop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. spi does not support the claim at present and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf whatever the outcome. im sure by rotating ip he probably means proxies. it isnt important though. cheers  chat • rff ~0

6628~ utcan interesting comment convict leasing isnt the same as slavery where theres ownership and title. however i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery...true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. one ended w/ the th amendment and the other was legalised under the th amendment not the corwin amendment of . in other words what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause? wwhat do you think they were referring to? futhermore i dont see a problem including this in the article so long as it is a small reference and not the focus of the article. as to scholarship there is reputable work on this and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business plantations mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. yes they were mostly black. the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery though not chattel. this was systematic and went on until ww though todays version is slightly different. now some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. slavery by another name by douglas blackmon who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic. thats the point. this is far from original research and there are other scholars whove written about it. now i havent edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here but id like to know the issue as it is now. how do other editors feel? one other thing american historians do not always agree on things and i have noticed at least one conspicious neoconfederate argument in the article unsourced though on a different part of the article. so yes its important to look at historians but on some topics theres a whole lot of rubbish particularly w/ slavery issues so a consensus by historians may never happen and sadly ideological agendas do exist and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources. id say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important. july~0

6725~ the bands legacy beggars banquet etc. an anonymous user is repeatedly misreading the guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it. heres the direct quotethe spark for fairport taking this watershed turn was the bands album music from big pink the record that along with bob dylan and the bands basement tapes bootleg brought about a widespread musical volteface in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. among the rock aristocracy its influence was evident in the beatles illfated backtobasics project let it be the rolling stones purple patch that began with beggars banquet and eric claptons decision to call time on cream.the anonymous user takes issue with this statement claiming that music from big pink could not have influenced beggars banquet because of chronology i.e. that the stones were almost done recording the album when big pink came out. but read the statement it does not say that it influenced the recording of banquet but the purple patch that began with... etc. this seems clear to me. i would like to hear some other editors opinions on this matter. thefortyfive ~0

6750~ april utcit means german only because some americans at some point misunderstood it and thought deitsch sounded like dutch. the paragraph suggesting that dutch used to mean what german means today is ridiculous. claiming that the inhabitants of the netherlands saw themselves as merely another german state in the holy roman empire is even more riduculous. so yes it does make sense to emphazise that pennsylvania dutch is a misinterpretation and that the immigrants were in fact german. having said that if the pennsylvania dutch refer to themselves and their language as such that should be the title of the aticle. ~0

6753~article evaluation article evaluation for this assignment i was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about change management. the first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic however it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. they key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. the information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. it most definitely covers a variety of topics including the reasons for such change. in addition to that the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. there is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. the article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text which can be found in the reference section. the contribution considers a variety of perspectives however i think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. it takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. i think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. the article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. it does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. in terms of article length the only thing i would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. overall it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. i couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. in terms of structure i would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.~0

6772~i am slowly working on many of the mountains of washington. i do one or two a day.i have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created. one is a list of highest points in each of washingtons counties. i research if they need disambiguation. so for big horn mountain i had to research whether there were other things called big horn there are tons of them. as you can see there are hundreds of uses of big horn. if i can i find newspaper articles relating to the place. but due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship... i have not been able to isolate one article about big horn. big horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in lewis county washington. but i did find a couple of trip reports. hello i have reviewed your editorial review request. good user keep up the good work aqurius   talk usercheeselor blocked thanks. wpwdefcon appears fine to me. penmon anglesey hi there. you may have noticed that ive been adding to the excellent article you created here a few extra refs and some photographs plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer. oh and i renamed it too can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment? i would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for good article status i havent done this before but it seems to comply with the criteria or to be nearly there anyway. what do you think? you baked the cake i just added the icing fingers crossed... oh dear... this might interest you. re wphd totd i was wondering about that too. wikipedia talktip of the day would be the appropriate place to bring this up but i dont think its very active. other than that the admins noticeboard or miscellanious village pump may be places to bring it up that would get a faster response. may tc penmon revisited hello again. the ga review picked up various points some easy to fix some not. anyway ive had a go and fixing things and i think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that ive missed particularly points and . then perhaps itll get its ga badge great work. ive renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away. good news i think that means that you and i are entitled to display this as a reward for our hard work. right wheres next? re user talkais importing scripts your looks fine and in fact it worked when i copied it to my account to test. try bypassing your cache again and see if it works now. june tc the original barnstar the original barnstar i noticed that your fairly new and saw that your edits were impressive and so ive decided to award you this original barnstar talk == re user~0

6780~ deletion of dave warwak page wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on dave warwak an educator of vegan practices and animal rights. i see that your comment on the reason for deletion was the only thing he is known for is being fired however that is not the case in the animal friendly vegetarian vegan community. in fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food. why would you find it so crucial to speedy delete a page that simply speaks of cruelty free living and aims to educate people on the truth about their food? is that information threatening to wikipedia for some reason? and i wouldnt think as a wiki admin that your opinion on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted. you may know mr. warwak as only being fired but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition. please show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page.~0

6791~ringmaili dont know if he regards himself as an expert ive sweated enough to know for sure that a broigne is not a victorian mistake and to find citable sources for it. i understand that the english language world lacks proper history on the subject but from a continental point of view theres no mistake possible that ringmail is different from chainmail and was used in the period between the fall of rome and the comeback of chainmail in the late s. also the high handed way in which he remade all the article with no regard for the effots of those who came before him and without even setting up an account for people to discuss the matter with him wxas to my view qualification for vandalism.im quite willing to include the bit about representations making it difficult to differenciate between chainmail and ringmail and the possibility of misconceptions in the s but the basic matter as established with my collaboration stands even if it has to be edited further.~0

6871~{{unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine. why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?. for exampleand this is... yep maybe you guessed it... question why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name... like say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor? specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid?. heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor?. ready for one more? then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment ?. oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking rr that says that but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense? well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say? well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give her/him a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingright/matchingconsensusisnodefense rule?... ~0

6899~this entry was deleted by its author owing to the fact that it contains research which is being distorted somewhat. since its a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist ive decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic. thus the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations distortions etc is to remove it. since you have decided to continue this antagonization i am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at wikipedia. of course you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the havana shipyards however ive decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article. use of any of the above by persons other than the author without his permission is in violation of international copyright standards and will be promplty reported to the fcc federal communications commission and all other pertinent authorities.~0

6911~==etymology==this etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many waysthe greek name tigris comes from the old persian word for tiger and means the fast one. it might also be argued to come from kurdish too. in kurdish tir means arrow. this means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.tîjtûj means sharp pointing and cutting. since the letter j doesnt exist in greek tîjtûj became tig later greek at the end of words is sonex is used tîjtijrtigtigrtigris. first of all the persian for tiger is babr not tigr or anything like it. the greek word tigris meaning tiger may be related to persian words within the same family as tigr but that is not the persian meaning of the words.second the kurdish and farsi word for arrow tir comes from middle persian tigr which also means arrow.third the word tij or rather tiz sharp is certainly related to tigr but they belong to the same word family they are not the same word.ill try to come up with something better.~0

7038~fair use rationale for imageatozbutterfinger.jpgthanks for uploading or contributing to imageatozbutterfinger.jpg. i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. – ~0
7039~i understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work. i understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution. it is the paragraph in question especially the example in that paragraph which distorts the workings of evolution. the phrase “it need only increase at a rate of . cm per generation = cm/” easily gives the impression of progressive linear change. the anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often i assume inadvertently find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of darwinian evolution. from these i have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions. carl sagan in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the galaxy. i read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.~0
7040~please do not add hoaxes to wikipedia. hoaxes are caught and marked for deletion shortly after they are created. if you are interested in how accurate wikipedia is a more constructive test method is to try to find inaccurate statements that are already in wikipedia – and then to correct them if possible. please dont disrupt wikipedia in an attempt to test our ability to detect and remove such material. feel free to take a look at the five pillars of wikipedia policy to learn more about this project and how you can make a positive impact. thank you. —what i do / what i say~0

7051~this is such a fun entry. devotchkai once had a coworker from korea and not only couldnt she tell the difference between usaenglish and british english she had trouble telling the difference between different european languages. kind of keeps things in perspective eh? not suprising. while i can easily tell the difference between french german italian spanish dutch etc. put me in a room with a chinese japanese korean vietnamese and a thai speaker and i probably couldnt tell the difference. if i saw it written id probably have somewhat more luck though. sjkvietnamese has more syllablefinal consonants than japanese i think you can tell them apart that way maybe. is this right? juuitchansomeone suggested heath robinson and rube goldberg as a vocabulary difference. its certainly an interesting parallel but i dont think it really belongs here. they were both artists with their own style and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested. at any rate they cant quite be considered translations because as an adjective rube goldberg is more specific describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions heath robinson in contrast is more surrealistic or fantasyoriented. ldcas an american i would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt a flat is an apartment and rubbish certainly is trash. granted i agree that a fag is not a cigarette and underground is not a subway. i may do some actual research and come back and fiddle with that list. eean.i think americans certainly understand the use of bum for butt rubbish for trash and to a lesser degree flat for apartment. but we dont use those terms much. point to a container for discarded things and an american will say thats a trash can a brit will say thats a rubbish bin. americans are more likely to use rubbish in the sense of bullshit. ldci deleted the following pair limited ltd and incorporated since they actually mean different things. incorporated means a corporation limited means a limited liability corporation you can also have unlimited liability corporations and no liability corporations. british and australian also ltd is roughly equivalent to american llc. sjki would say torch was much more common than pocket lamp which sounds quite oldfashioned. flashlight would be more easily recognised than the latter.yes id call it a torch and it would probably be labeled as a flashlight in its manufacturers packaging. imo torch is colloquial british english the anomeoh so flashlight is correct british usage? my dictionary said am. and the oxford english dictionary carried flashlight only in the meaning of photography. then ill remove the entry again. axelboldt~0

7056~{{unblock reason= derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor. the statement is not about content ive added to this entry of which there isnt any to speak of. i could have opinions and theories about his mother but i dont go around posting them. instead userscray choose to post the following message and block me. i dont see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources. this is equally as offensive as were the comments of the other editors nor is the statement even true. you dont see much evidence because my properly sourced submissions are reverted. i ask you or any other editor to show me one misuse of a source. this is a a link to my last edit on the entry. diff i include it as it was correctly sourced using perapproved sources that had consensus and the changes concerning definitions in the entry were discussed on the talk page and also had consensus..disruptive edit not an improvement? that opinion is not supportable.the changes were made to bring the entry into compliance with wplead standards because the definitions were faulty. .now i ask you again what content have i submitted on that page that had an unreliable source as youve alleged when blocking me? you have made the same unfounded accusation as the other two editors. regardless of what you think of another editors edits keep that to your self if you post a derogatory comment about me and cant back up the statement you are lying too apparently simply in an attempt to damage my credibility. it is that simple. now i formally ask you to point out the reference are referring to in your negative posts about me this is not a difference of opinion. it is a fabrication and a personal attack upon my credibility. comment on content not on the contributor. you commented on both and were not truthful in your comment about the content and sources. derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor. instead you added more of them.in addition for like the fourth time this person decides to call me a full blown believer and pusher of this conspiracy theory which i repeatedly denied. i took offense.both other editors received talk messages from me. after you came along one editor user dbrodbeck apologized for his statement.. i appreciate that and accept his apology and will tell him so when unblocked. the other person userbrangifer received a call for truce on his talk page but refused to retract his comment. he has repeated attacked my credibility and now has thrown out a serious accusation without one shred of foundation or substance and banned me from his talk page. his badgering continues on the entry talk page without apology or any shred of anything to substantiate his offensive comment. to have userscray come along and say stuff like regardless of what you think of another editors edits namecalling a personal attack wont go well. i did not call a name. i called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that i was calling it as it presented itself. i did not comment on his edits i commented the fact that he did not consider my reference to articles from the washington post san francisco chronicle associated press and national archives of the government of canada to be reliable sources. unbelievably you seem be echoing his position. i probably wont post this elsewhere but if you cant show me an example of using a poor source on that page it is obvious that you have also posted the same fabrication about me in reference to sources. anyone who fabricates or perpetuates or posts derogatory information is a liar. liars cannot be trusted and lying editors compromise the integrity of wp. userscray said i dont see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources. userscray needs to show me where evidence was seen by him that had i based something in the entry on an unreliable source . userscray can not substantiate the posted comment the made. if you dont prove it with an example then your statement is a lie. if you find yourself in this situation then you are a liar and you have personally attacked this editors credibility. if that is the case id~0

7061~ july utcwell yes thats fine but the point here is that there is no publishers statement made about anything in that sentence. the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. if the resource says joe at worms then we write joe ate worms. about tarnishing any reputation that isnt the point at all. and about accepted practices in the publishing world this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. about people keeping records of how many books were published i think you missed the point there. publishers weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. they are a secondary source. do you see how thats different? about the article on fip it hadnt any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. fip and are the same entity. facim is also the same entity. this is known. having the same board of directors as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim® etc. makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources. ~0

7080~ henrietta van laer says no. its not that having an agenda at all is a problem for wikipedia. wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda prosocialists liberals greens and gays determined to vilify and demonize conservatives. it is a completely biassed source. its articles on socalled leftwing parties are blatant whitewash while those on socalled rightwing parties are nothing but vilification most of it based on flimsy thirdhand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. instead of detailing their policies wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.pov in wikispeak = different pov to us the wikipolice. i also get the impression that wikipeople are pretty young. there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. how naive can you get? i dont know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average. naturally they are inclined to vote labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a rightwing taxcutting party. many of them earn two or three times the average wage and like the fat cats they get generous pensionpackages too. added to the votes of the millions of people who live longterm on state benefits this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honestjoe workers or lowpaid. but wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics with a poster of che guevara on the wall his hair streaming in the wind.~0

7298~it seems to be one of the old info from the times when in wikipedia the need for sourcing them was not so pressing simply remaining unquestioned until now. i dont know any external source that would present how the roma have significant cultural similarities with the cultural features that the balinese borrowed from the subcontinent. because of this and because it may be misleading lacking the presentation of the common cultural features with the indians personally i have in mind to add them when ill have available time i consider it would be appropriate to delete this statement.~0

7303~fantastic thank you thats extremely helpful. that biography contains details of his early and late life that do not exist in the other sources ive got his time in paris pretty well fleshed out slonimskys reminiscences in perfect pitch are full of juicy details. im still trying to understand all the orthodox religious references in some of my other sources e.g. two resurrections? im a little out to sea on some of that. its hard to write about his tone method without doing forbidden original research because it seems no one has really studied it in depth sitsky maybe more than anyone else i really want to look at one of the scores. now if only i had a public domain illustration or two ... anyhow now i can cite that biography thanks to you im presuming that the world encyclopedia in russian is a reliable source. everything sounds right and matches up with grove and the others ive got. cheers talk ~0
7304~mqm and their abu garib style terrorismi saw the debate between imran khan babar and ajaz ul haq and i felt sorry for imran bhai that he was mistreated for his private life matters which was brought up as a more important matter than crimnal history of thug like altaaf hussain and his party who only tortures and kills whoever they wants. i have witnessed mqm and their abu garib style crimes. my cousin has worked for mqm and he told us that if he leaves the party he and his own family would be slaughtered. entire karachi has been suffering because of altaaf bhai of india who is getting bhuttas in the form of water mafia and karachi people do not have electricity and he is enjoying the cold breeze of london. imran khan must get this thug deported to india because if he will return to pakistan then pakistanis will teach him exactly what it is like to call creation of pakistan a blunder.~0

7314~thanks for your comment sorry i have not been in touch for a while. i have been in united kingdom. singapore is truly amaing. the people are wonderful they live to serve and they are well trained in respect. singapore is a different world to australia and a different world to where im in. the last weekhas been full on i have spent many days in london then head towards grantham then stratforduponavon shakespeares countryand now in the worlds most educated city and oldest cities in the world oxford. lord of the rings was created here not the movie but the story trilogy was here. england is sort of similar to australia only older more history more pubsmore peopletiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. im doing all right for money and spent some at londons best gamesworkshop in oxford street. gamesworkshops are bigger and better in england. i have been to a couple but cant buy much because of space in my ags. rohan saun would love these gamesworkshops in england. there are mini gamesworkshops in villages smaller than broadford and still they are fanstatic. bigger gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger towns and cities eg nottingham london mancester oxford and many more. tell rohan that i went past the gamesworkshop headquarters the citadel miniatures factory and warhammer world in nottingham. but unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was derbyshire and ran out of time. but i certainly will go there when i come back to england if i have time. im still a little jet laged from the plane journey to london from singapore. i will be back at assumption college on oct th i think.cheerstom~0

7334~wow...doesnt really sound like a guy who should be spending his valuable time messing around with other peoples work on wikipedia. yet for dramatic effect he has time to list each and every topic on his test. total drama queen. i have seen admins refer to complaints of users as whining many times so i will assume that i am free to call the above post by islander i bit whiney in fact very pathetically whiney. i hold a masters in science degree and i do not recall whining about the course work exams etc to others esp. to those whom i dont even know. on top of that within the confines of a purely voluntary project grew up and grow a pair i mean really. wtf? islander you said i should count myself warned i think you know what to count yourself. no a block wouldnt surprise me at all. it would be a typical admin kneejerk response.~0

7340~ rajputs not rajasthanis...right? p prof. hancocks studies mention that the romani people are most closely related to the punjabis and rajputs im pretty sure not rajasthanis. he calls protoromani rajputic. the distinction is important if they are partly descended from rajputs who were never really confined to any one part of india that would explain the linguistic variation within the indic words in romani. for example why the use of o instead of aa at the end of masculine nouns/adjectives in romani? this is certainly a characteristic of gujarati and sindhi but is it a characteristic of rajasthani languages? anyway if im wrong in making the last change i made as of now ill be happy to revert it myself. oh of course ~0

7450~i think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. so if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldnt be a problem with it? particularly i imagine if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?i read each of the candidates statements and used that to judge if this question would be useful look at the time between asking the candidates questions. also look at the ignore all evidence question this occurred to me as i was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the days question plus this shows it was not a spam question to all candidates i did pay attention to their statements.this is the question i posed to select candidates.what general concerns do you think are raised by the days of silence from the communitys admins in this ani? are there any other general concerns which arise from the ani?do these quotesameliorate add to or amplify concerns?do you agree with the substance of the jehochman quotes?if an essay wpignore all the evidence were written what concerns would be behind it and what could be done about them?if you can point me to another ani where lies and deceit by two admins within an ani were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to days then i will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates substituting this with that example. would that be acceptable?have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? or is this the only one? of course to answer that you would also have to answer can you say in all honesty that you think ruslik did not lie in this ani? if you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self? ~0

7483~ legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. the source reads the european union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. lets have a look at the law itself. framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences ... public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group. in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case. whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal. as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredis the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court? ~0

7492~trevithj the reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention setpoints errors and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market. the remarks of black are perfectly clear and also make no mention of these factors nor do his patents. they are understandable as he intended them the use of feedback bypasses the inadequacies of the nonlinear variable and uncontrollable properties of the largegain open loop amplifier as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closedloop gain to be set at /β as fixed by a resistor divider for example by making the closedloop gain independent entirely of the openloop gain. i dont think you fully appreciate the simple algebra that governs this circuit. ~0

7578~balance==i find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory. to introduce badoglios career by saying he was an italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing red cross hospitals and ambulances during the ethiopia campaign. due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely. thats words about his military and political career and about his activities as a war criminal. the war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence. if this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of badoglios involvement in the events. it seems to me far more important to stress the facts that badoglio was one of italys most senior military figures during the second world war despite his doubts about italys strategic capabilities and that he became prime minister after the downfall of mussolini. badoglios role in the inexplicable two months delay between july and september when italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while germany rushed troops south to fortify the italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career. whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively badoglios inaction condemned italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war. this article in its present form barely mentions those events. ==~0

7597~admin inputif you were in communication with an admin and were actively working on it you or the admin should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. quite frankly i dont believe the draft article youre working on is ready to go for the following reasons theres a number of grammar and spelling errors headers should not have caps except for first letter and should not be wikilinks bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only references shouldnt be generalized like youve put them. individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references see wpfn and wpcitet if you dont know how to do this the section on search engine submission software should be omitted entirely as its covered in a separate article. dont duplicate material thats what wiki links are for move the reasons why its notable media coverage awards to the st or nd paragraph please be aware that wikipedia is not a howto guide so instructional information about how to use the software is not appropriate. you can eliminate the further reading as the book is in the refs and get rid of the dummies graphic its not relevant to the particular program...it looks like youre plugging the book. akradeckispeaketh retrieved from ~0

7610~if the nazis meant reich as empire they could have made that clear by translating it that way in englishlanguage material they produced. they did not do so. they always used reich in english translations. for one of many examples see this page it is the official german government translation of a hitler speech. note that reich is always reich. the nazis did not consider frederick the great as having anything to do with the first reich. they did view him as a great german. the problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be a very accurate translation. wikipedia does not depend on what editors think it depends on what they can support with reliable sources. you have yet to provide a single reliable source that supports your point. i and others have provided quite a few supporting the opposite. ~0
7611~you are either deluded about the nature of your edits or are lying. you have certainly deleted reliable sources and opinions from reliable sources without full consensus and youve done so in the last hours in fact. i invite anyone to check his contribution history to see if his edits match his claims and am quite confident anyone who does will see what i mean.~0

7613~list of united states cities by area says sitka alaska has square miles of which are land juneau alaska has square miles of which are land anchorage alaska has square miles of which are land and jacksonville florida has square miles of which are land.list of cities by surface area matches that except that it mentions juneau city and borough.the pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match too. yet when i posted in this section several days ago the article on jacksonville said . square miles.jacksonvilles own government website says it has square miles not or .im not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a countys land into the citys listed area. i can say that in the case of jacksonville although the governments of the a city of jacksonville and b duval county are unified there is or ought to be separate reckoning of the citys and countys area because duval county also contains three other cities jacksonville beach atlantic beach and neptune beach which are not part of the city of jacksonville they have their own separate police departments for example—even though the jacksonville public library is countywide.the government website of the city and borough of juneau says it has . square miles of land and . square miles of water for a total of . square miles. neither the total nor the land area there matches what wikipedia gives.at the government website of the city and borough of sitka i havent found the area.same for the government website of anchorage. but it does link to which says the city has square miles—which like the government figures for jacksonville and juneau doesnt match wikipedias figure. ~0

7636~ this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x for the following reasons. should sort amd or intel implementations as x? generally x was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa might or might name themselves with such as cyrix x intel pentium and so on. amds long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together. nowadays software labeled themselves as x are ia compatible software and use x or x differentiating with it. so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. . generations? what is the th generation x processor? who invented this kinda processors? amd k just says that it succeeds amd k rather than saying it is the th x processor and ive never heard intel call their x processors exceeding the th generation. and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the th x processor succeeding pentium iii but none confirmed this. so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and efficeon if the morph firmed on the system board implements x decoder call themselves as x processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor? at this situation what kind of processor is it? ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the th/th generation x? who is another jane austen making up another northanger abbey?. x is one architectureisa name? what such a ridiculous thing that ive ever heard on earth x is used to referring the processor a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. if it were the name of an architecture then in this logic way intel is one of the implementation of this architecture? ~0

7648~please refrain from making personal comments. you know better than that. vaswani being an owner of the hendon mob site has nothing whatever to do with your incorrect conclusionjumping about the site. you were wrong and you should have done some research before you made several mistatements. in contrast if you would have said a site owned by the person being profiled should be avoided as a reference if possible you would have made a valid point and one that is easily dealt with since there are similar sites that could be cited instead. still your own point makes no sense since there is obviously independent corroboration and many reliable sources cite it. but again that was not the point here. you should do minimal factual research before making inaccurate assertions about blatantly obvious reliable sources. you do seem to have moved on from that now even if you havent admitted the error so we can just move on past this.~0

7661~yeah they really exist. you need at least one w one fa from that class and one w one from that class and you can make the others from them a few carnivores species need more. essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition where for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids sugar vitamins and minerals fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as iv formulas. the reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w and you need w and w fatty acids to make lipids the w dha is your most common neural tissue fat. ill see what i can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. there is some quackery out there like pills that contain w because olive oil is cheap but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking actually unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly. btw there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. this destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all pufas. on such a diet even dogs get severe atherosclerosis and they are species highly resistant to it their hdls are higher than their ldls. so all this is quite fascinating. ~0

7761~i mean really they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith adding information that was included in an already used source. their edit summary didnt show any hostility so you should not retaliate with any. odds are they havent even looked at their talk page so your comment wont be read anyways. if the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out maybe this is a problem you should see about solving instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you. plus antoshi already warned them on their talkpage and they have not added anything since showing that maybe they have listened to the advice. your threat was completely unnecessary. maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added but rejected and why would be a better option. wpagf and wpbite are very important. like i said in the dispute resolution page i dont mean to make any enemies. i think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects. although your attitude when people do things against your wishes needs to be worked on if you wish to avoid further complications. talk·edits ~0

7767~ ive come across variations on draughts as ive always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variationsdammspiel thats what the manual called it i think its also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue.turkish checkers similar settup to dammspiel/damenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares youd use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules.one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts dagger draughts or kings.played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts.i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man cant take a king. apparently according to this page thats the rules in italian draughts.~0

7782~yes triplea baseball should be on the list like football league championship in total attendance. next in us sports like mlb nba nfl and nhl they all have two more innerleagues in each of league. e.g. eastern/western conference or american/national league. their innerleagues are the section of the league. they play against other division teams in a season. so the league itself is mlb nba nfl and nhl. but there are no games between the international league/pacific coast league and mlb. so they are different leagues.~0

7857~way i see it people who say the sherman is a very good tank are seriously overestimating it. i mean come on it was nicknamed ronson for a reason you know. any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. the only notable good sherman at the end of the war is the vc firefly but because us ordinance doubted the pounder could be fitted onto the tank it was manufactured in limited quantities. the only notable features of the sherman was that it was produced in large quantities had a mechanical reliability that beat the t and came with better secondary equipment such as fm radio and an elevation gyrostabiliser.not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. once a sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a tiger tank. the tiger shot at the building and the shell went right through and penetrated the shermans turret. there are also tales of german tanks who take out two aligned shermans in one shot. also do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull? those are efforts to help augment the armour of the sherman.~0

7902~ march utcthat sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. the rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. you may think that this is obvious but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the ut report were influenced by the funding received.perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? i mean thats about the only way you could ever meet your demand. what an utterly absurd request. its easy to see why it was made though just set the bar so high it cant be jumped then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you dont like. maybe youd have me hack the email accounts of the authors fish around for evidence assuming there is even any there then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that i can cite on here. only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by texas. the universitys state is the heart and soul of us oil gas but thats certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true the university has multimilliondollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the united states not to mention other oil gas companies with interests in fracking. i have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links but only a fool would suggest the potential isnt there. if you dont like the juxtaposition just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak pathetic and denigrating as you like for all i care maybe something like socialist—nay communist—campaigners in the pay of a european maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest noting that... for comparison take the recent globalwarming sceptics at the heartland institute as soon as details of the institutes funding were leaked they were prominently reported in the press. we dont even need leaks here the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out as smm` and others have done. all you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. according to ian urbina we cant even get a decent untarnished report out of the epa unlike texas the epa doesnt even take industry funding for gods sake yet still it cant escape heavy industry pressure to redact. aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes i have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to though i am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry and their paidfor puppets in government to tone down or eliminate negative findings and the truly just ridiculous claims about frackings potential by people like lord browne here in england. and i couldnt care less if frackings safe or not. why should i? or anyone? if its not its not if it is... it is outside of a lunatic asylum who would care? if it is safe enough bring it on jobs tax receipts increased energy security reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldnt be interested in those things particularly given the current economic situation. what i dont like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material. ~0

7912~thanks very much for the restored toungoo map. borders its close enough but i wish its possible to use increasingly lighter shades. e.g. youve followed the presentday border more or less for the chinese border which i suppose is a reasonable representation of the line of control. but the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. anaukpetlun and thalun controlled some of koshanpye campaigns on top of presentday shan state and east of bhamo though not as extensive or deeper into yunnan as did bayinnaung likewise all the sawbwas in modern kachin state and sawbwas in northern shan state also paid dual tribute. but since its not technically feasible i guess well just have to provide an explanation on this. a number of locations are offsome by a lot. chiang mai ava kyaukse nyangshwe pegu and kale. also please add the cities of nan and chaing saen in lan na. nan was the easternmost possession. chaing saen kyaing thin was the capital of northern lan na. the burmese divided lan na into two.again thanks very much for the help. regards ~0

7997~i must quote what dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when i translate i use province of lower silesia etc. however here on wikipedia i have to go with decisions made long ago. the problem is that wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. they should be aware that in real life the use of voivodeship results in confusion as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. some polish people may not care about it because polish is a readerresponsible language so polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. by contrast english is a writerresponsible language i.e. writers in english are responsible for making their texts understandable. i wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article pages . importantly this is reflected in the wikipedia manual of style as one of the five general principles of wikipedia is clarity writing should be clear and concise. plain english works best avoid jargon and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. voivodeship is jargon understandable nearly exclusively to polish people.i started a similar discussion in wikipedia many years ago but i was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now its too late. i wish i was more experienced then and knew that voivodeship is against the principles of wikipedia. ~0
