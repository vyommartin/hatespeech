4135~ free software / open source in many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source. the best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. if you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term i have no objection. if the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. if the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license excluding the gnu gpl. its text explicitly uses the term free software then its ok to use that description. the purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case. unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis.if you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better. ~0

4163~in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims. it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp. the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue. this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.~0

4173~records of awesome editors who truly want to help==as this is not a study of peoples hesitancy it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for peoples hesitancy. it would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. if this study is the reason for peoples hesitancy then we should be pointing to a reliable thirdparty source that states that its the reason not to the study itself. if we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film jaws we use as a reference the source that makes that statement not the film itself. so no its not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. nat gertler talk that has got to be the clearest explanation yet. so what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality then cite both sources? or should i use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. is this where wiki gets the facts from opinions then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is wpor? it is built by popular opinion of the editors from opinion pieces not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though i hope notdcrsmama talk no im not saying cite both sources. references are there to verify the facts that are being stated in wikipedias voice. if the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy there is no need to cite the study. even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study we might mention this study in the text but the study itself is not reference for the statement. and i am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. if you have concerns about the other sources in the article you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. nat gertler talk from wprps==~0

4194~marnanel your talking nonsense there is no dispute in the real world.money magazine wrote that article after complaints were made is now out dated. stevensons legal battles have been settled for some time. all the text vary from each other which is reflected on the page. there is no dispute between powers and myself. her attorneys were contacted and since then her products have reverted to her particular text only. the problem was these people thought they could cheat me and they got caught. now they have suffered terrible embarassment over it. the matter has been resolved and i am not willing to sacrifice my legacy with the public hog washing these stories. enough is enough. money magazine never interviewed one single author for that story. my legacy does not revolve around money magazine but my authorship. and if you want to present the footprints poem in the wikiyou must show the chronology of the poems history. what is it that you need to present reliable source to this article?be specific. i removed my published book from world wide marketingis that enough proof of authorship for you. if so then see authorhouse for details or contact me. thank you carolyn joyce carty~0

4196~further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede . since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards. sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it. ~0

4201~hi . i like the diagram but i believe that the terminal station should be in normal text because it is where the train is ultimately heading toward. similarly the next stop should be in small text because it is just a station on the wayside on the trains journey toward the last stop except in the penultimate stations of each line where the word terminus shows that the next stop is the terminus. in the layouts that were originally written for the taipei metro and guangzhou metro the terminal was placed before the next stop so i had based the nycarea railroad layouts on the taipei/guangzhou layouts. ~0

4205~dect isnt really a new technology. its a newer standard but tdm/tdma/fdma digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of dect. dect is itself a successor to ct japans phs is very similar and of course gsm damps and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. to suggest there are special health issues with dect would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. dect is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces both during transmissions and inherently because even when in use the td nature of the system means the system isnt transmitting continuously.as i believe ive said before there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of lowpower radio technology and there being a link in the see also section of this article to it. that article of course should look nothing like the section i yanked. there is nothing about dect however that merits a special section on dects dangers especially when new technology or otherwise there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.~0

4283~sorry your protest goes unnoticed. for you to protest about my characterization there would have to be a qualified adjective next to your name. or a description of a series of actions grounded on blatantly false information. what i claim is that you are reengaging in a series of edits and deletes which is factually correct and therefore morally permissible.i take no sides. i see things how they are. you never cite your sources and as such i do not feel compelled to prolong my answer any further. good day. per wikipedia policy i am letting myself know that i am one of the designated mediation parties for a current article dispute~0
4284~relevance? in a new zealand tv series presented by rebecca gibney called sensing murder which aired on tvnz beginning in three psychic mediums from australia and new zealand sue nicholson kelvin cruickshank and deb webber armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. the team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains. skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources and it was further satirized in the season finale where host jeremy wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.just how relevant is this? granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show. we are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. if high profile mediums were used i would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.cheers~0

4306~its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement. there was a recent newspiece a quote by putin times of israel putin first soviet government was mostly jewish. apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact. in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article.~0

4318~ reply thanks for the input i will correct the urls and the terminology tomorrow. i was under the impression solus operating system was a linux distro and not to be confused with what has a page on here called solusos are you that same project? if not which i think is the case i can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article blanking this one called solus operating system so long as that is available. if you would prefer right now to not have a wikipedia article i`ll gladly comply with your wish. some organizations don` t really want to be on wikipedia for various reasons. anyway i am enjoying your os. if you get around to it could explain to me what makes solus its own os rather than a linux distro? also i understood that although you use budgie gnome is behind it. when i look at details in solus it says gnome .x.x also my name is being changed to spiffyanarchist fyi.~0

4324~ section needs to be edited this line about new hampshire is not very accurateon january for the first time martin luther king day was officially observed in all states. prior to that new hampshire and arizona did not observe the day.in fact new hampshire passed civil rights day in to honor dr king and other civil rights activists like rosa parks and malcolm x. since the article states clearly that other states such as utah have different names for the holiday including combining it with confederate military heroes this sentence does not seem justifiable. the article leaves the impression that new hampshire was some sort of bigoted state that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.i am a newbie to wikipedia how do we fix this?~0

4331~i know derex very well. he has been stalking me ever since i wrote the campaign finance article months ago. i tell him if he finds anything incorrect in what i write to help himself and fix it but he then ignores me and i find comments of his later on talk pages with vailed insults about spamming pages and calling me a zealot. he is clearly a stealth idealogue who has no intention of making constructive edits. his only goal appears to be stalking other constructive editors.as for your statement that i am placing a relatively long fundraising scandal section into this article hogwash. a short two sentence paragraph with a link to the main article is not a long section. wikipedia rules clearly state we are to link relevant articles to eachother. as the dnc was fined for illegal fundraising and many of its fundraiser were convicted of crimes this page is the most relevant page to link my article to. an article by the way that has featured status and has been showcased on wikipedias main page. i am putting the info back into the article where it belongs. i am not waiting months for some imaginary discussion to take place here. no one reads talk pages and the few that would actually stop by will be partisans. if you continue to delete factual referenced history from this article i will report you to the moderators. good day ~0
4332~from my standpoint you are the confused. im looking at it in the rd person. what the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. fact is that the britons were in an antiangles coalition and the angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. if the britons had contact to the former roman empire is unclear but possible. they lived under roman rule for centuries and were romanized. this defeat was something like deromanizing to them after years of roman rule. this can clearly be seen when you read and understand the roman britainanglosaxon battles in germanic wars.~0

4524~there are plenty of video game articles that need assistance in some form. what the admins are looking for is proof that you want to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia. ranting about a block and not finding one article out of millions that needs some form of constructive editing isnt very helpful to your cause. if what you say regarding the squid is true then heres what id suggest ... identify the episode number of the show that contained that information. televisions programs can be considered reliable sources if the show is factual in nature such as a documentary or news program. take that section of the squid article which admittedly is rather short and expand upon it just as the admins suggested. note the number of brains with the source information. locate other articles on the web showing how the intelligence of the squid has been tested and add that. write that section here in your talk page making sure to use proper grammar spelling etc. au ~0

4527~fan related linkshello all. i know some of you may have found my additions irritating on this site more specifically my linking a youtube clip of my friend on the news giving his fresh impressions of the movie just after viewing it.let me just say that my friend is a very dedicated fan which the news clip even attests to and although his comments might seem a bit unusual i think theyre interesting in that they speak unique ways a fan could view a movie.as far as copyright infringement or irrelevance ive already addressed how the clip is relevant so ill say what i have to on ip. having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years and now as a student in law school i am convinced from what i know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the abc news team for the release of their story. so please can we try to negotiate or come to some sort of agreement that it will be okay to leave this clip up? im new to wikiediting but believe this clip would make a nice addition to the spiderman site. im sure lots of fans would find it funny and interesting to say the least. so what do you say people?~0

4547~rewiredi see you have updated the security system. nice. is it a mcafee ?. just dropped by to relate a little story i uncovered as i wandered here and there...there once was a little boy named johnny who had a wonderful dog named laddie. johnny was prone to emotional outbursts and his mother was concerned by his overreactions. one day while johnny was at school laddie was killed in an unfortunate accident. the mother took laddies body and put it in the backyard. she was very worried how johnny would react to the news of his dogs death. when johnny returned from school his mother said to him im really sorry johnny but laddie died in an accident. johnny responded okay and went upstairs to change his clothers. the mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. after johnny put on his play clothes he went out to the backyard. all of a sudden the mother heard johnny screaming. she rushed out to the backyard and saw johnny prostrate over the dogs body and wailing. the mother said but johnny i told you laddie died. in between sobs johnny sputtered i thought you said daddy.``` talk ~0

4552~ dear kumarrao no ill feelings i was just following wiki standards. even i have refered govt inscriptions and census of india earlier in my wiki writings but they are not considered as reliable by wiki admins. the reliability depends on the wide acceptibilty. kb choudary might did some great work for his community but if you go through latest historical books mr. kb choudary is being described more as caste based author. i can refer that statement if you want. if wiki admins think it is also authentic book then every one else will accept it thats it. i dont want to argue on this much. ~0

4559~==notability of thomas dworzak== a tag has been placed on thomas dworzak requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done because the article appears to be about a real person organization band club company etc. or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. if this is the first page that you have created then you should read the guide to writing your first article.if you think that you can assert the notability of the subject you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subjects notability under wikipedia guidelines.for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies. feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. talk my contributions. ~0

4586~criticism > the oohashi et al. results reveal some interesting contradictions. while full bandwidth sound was preferred to cd limited bandwidth over a speaker the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. additionally the preference for hfc was not replicated when using headphones only with speaker presentation ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. these are not contradictions. they are an essential feature of the study specified and discussed in the paper. there is no contradiction here. out it goes. contrary evidence and abx tests oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. abx tests only tell what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. if same research methods had been used and results were drastically different that should be called contradictory. i will state that even more generally than previous there are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to but nevertheless they affect humans wellbeing and happiness. for example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. we just dont know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. some signals could be processed half consciously in humans brains one feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.~0

4609~yes i do realize a lot of people made contributions to the article when i approached it. this is why i made a lot of effort to get other opinions on the rewrite and what the article should cover. see talksexrewrite of article wikipedia talkwikiproject sexology and sexuality wikipedia talkwikiproject biologysex and wikipedia talkversion. editorial team/core topicssex. no secret has been made of this rewrite—you can see how difficult it has been to get feedback. this article obviously had no steward as you so aptly describe on your userpage. i chose to become that steward when i proposed and made the rewrite. i would eventually like to take this core article to fa and its been difficult to get any feedback.perhaps you didnt realize it but a see also section is deprecated material should be covered within the body of the article. this came up during the genetics fac. im sorry your link got removed i thought i had covered everything in the article. as i noted on the talk page i think the article should have a top level section on evolution and i think this link could eventually go in there.i like you. im surprised hurt and disappointed that youre so quick to be angry with me. in my past experience and up to now with the sex article ive been too hesitant to throw away old material and too slow to rewrite. because i got no response to my proposal and because the article was so poorly written i went ahead and did it. wikipedia encourages us to be bold. who works on gender seemed happy with it. ✉ ✍ ~0

4611~the table of sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the three sacks in order to raise the yamiking and likewise hydrate to the surface. typically a being from the reverse maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions we see when crimson love and the sacks return to the dark world they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface. my assumption is that an object such as the yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use. thus the table of sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals in the form of a clock to power the yamiking. after the sacks summon the clock crimson and love throw over defeated opponents already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff into each number with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the yamiking. ~0

4645~so far nobodys reverted me so that gives me hope. meantime let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. in recent years wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers clients and others considering doing business with someone. naturally the one doing the vetting has the lions share of responsibility in judging an entrys reliability and supplementing it with other research. that said do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents as far as possible an accurate wellrounded picture of the subject? in the case of ms. caesar i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny. what are your thoughts? ~0

4708~ deleted part wll ryan we are aspie or aspergian. we have a more fundamental right to edit this page than you. it is like a white person telling a black person what civil rights movement is. joe mele why so defensive? please im trying to work with you here. plus no one has more rights to edit a page then anyone else. is there something in particular that offends you about it? if so we can try to rework it from a nuetral point of view but censoring it is not good at all. t c sorry but see the talk on the autism talk page. all right i will take it down a notch. joe mele thanks joe t c please move this discussion to a user page for joe mele or relevant ip number thank you. august excuse me but where is the love??? i am a little hurt joe mele it would simply be better to create a userpage and have discussions there. august deleting comments on your talk page i should point out the wikipage wikipediaavoiding common mistakes. this page is essentially a list of rules that others expect you to abide by. the second to last rule is relevent to talk pages. while its not the case that you can never delete material from your user page it is not considered acceptable to do so to new comments. i wouldnt worry too much about undeleting the comments you have already deleted but i would ask respectfully that you refrain from deleting any further comments especially those critical of yourself. if you continue to delete critical comments on this page you may find that others take offense in which case they may try to get you banned. oct utc~0

4710~firstly some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts? also the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said. perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant. perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily. i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia but i also exploited loop holes in the rules. so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning. and im so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page. you asked that we do something i.e. explain the significance of the clan etc and we did but you deleted it anyway. and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us. also one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that? if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth? also if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right? if you say no then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit. before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. ~0

4821~ok ill try to sort through your latest post here. let me know if i misinterpret something.first you specify a theory axiomatic system namely zfcp+ppomega exists. lets call that t for easy reference.now you argue that t proves the existence of a model lets call it m the because its not a model of t but of a new theory such thatm satisfies zfcppomega is in m. now do you mean the real pomega or do you mean that m satisfies pomega exists that is that theres an element of m that m thinks is pomega? im guessing the latter that m satisfies pomega exists.you say aleph is in the model and is less than or equal to the cardinality of pomega. again im guessing you mean that this is in the models opinion that is m satisfies the statement exists and .ok so going with my guesses thus far i agree that t proves the existence of such an m. m might be for example mg where m equals which is a model for t and g is mgeneric for the partial order to add cohen reals.~0

4891~my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. that was like the nd day almost two months ago.all of my references are nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation. i didnt put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge.i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. for instance i wrote to the aba and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article. i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view. those references were deleted by someone i cant remember who and dont know why. at this point the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid transcript. the guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers. even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for. i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.i dont believe that i did any original research. all i did is search the internet for references for the article. i really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article. i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf which date back to . also when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst.i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway. same as the u.n. covenantcant really hide that. i didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously. like today i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which i think is because of judge learned hand who was in the fifth circuit. and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se no there was not. what i found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly.i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing. i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. ive been an entrepreneur. i didnt know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article. that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article. the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article.arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself. one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i havent got it yet. but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state slave state border state. also there were issues related to indians in some of the western states. the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too i think. so did the history of workmens comp which is of course related to unions. ~0
4892~yogendraji......why don`t you start an ashram and spread non voilence and stop calling yourselves a polititian....? a so called leader without even votes?~1
4893~well i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article. it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress. i have two problems first it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in to science as a specifically western project. second although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge the history of science is rather more complicated than that.one way to deal with this if others find my criticisms valid is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck etc on the one hand and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other. for example i think everyone agrees that aristotle newton einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims. id hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of say thomas kuhn and bruno latour could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously as well as the claims of those with opposing views.i am glad ed has begun this article it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. sr~0
4894~fair use rationale for imagethanks for uploading or contributing to image i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. ~0

4911~quoting hoppe first detailing kinsellas important pointsat this diff i put in the democracy section hoppes earlier comment first and followed with more about what kinsella said i.e.stephan kinsella writes that hoppes critics have accused hoppe of homophobia bigotry and the like based on these passages. kinsella wrote that that hoppes discussion of physically removing homosexuals and other groups only applied to private covenantbased communities centered around traditional values. he shared a letter hope wrote to him saying the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society.as i said in my edit summary just because some choose to totally take his comments about of context and attack him does not mean that wikipedia should be used for the same purpose. talkie talkie🗽 ~0

4965~well i used to work up at the mall for a storewhich has since closed and i know all the inside dirt as to why nobody wants to bring any new business industry or stores here. i cant get into the specific detailsthats an entirely different topic but i can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now. cambridge shopping centers has placed it up for sale time and time again. nobody wants it and i dont blame them. if sears ever decides to pull out of there they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it because the land is worth more than the mall itself. everything is going northside anyway. downtown chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the s and it never fully recovered. and the capitol theatre? give me a break. they might as well give up on that too. its been what? over ten years now and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing we stil arent any closer to it being finished or having a final completion date. as far as chatham as a city goes i have never seen so many unsavoury shady people in my life. not everyone is like that i agree but yes it would seem as though chatham does qualify as the welfare capitol on ontario. drugs unwed mothers crackheads dropouts second and third generation welfare families a plethora of health problems and well you get the pitcure. is it any wonder why the younger crowd is leaving in droves? i cant say that i blame them. the grass is greener on the other side. chathams prime was over a long time ago. its london and points east that you want to be...~0

5023~meters sigh and my concerns only because mr meter had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far i did not have a single chance to develop it. his article called ¨falsetto¨ is not about falsetto. it may be about his arrogance who knows. there are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto. there are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which mr meter such anxiously protects. in england italy or spain th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. on the top of it mr meter perhaps never heard pavarotti singing falsetto or the falsetto of ian gillan. singing of king diamond is based on falsetto. what about michael kiske? is it not falsetto? mariah carey or whitney houston do did not sing falsetto? does any of these falsettos sound breathy? not to me. isnt out there published a note about those? maybe only because meter does not look for it. why? it would not fit to his article. he would have to admit that his only source vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. meter quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the world. the whole physiology of his ¨only¨ falsetto is based on encyclopedia? well perhaps it is enough for wikipedia or himself. but not for me. no. there is much more out there only regarding physiology. much much more. and just because you allow idiots like meter to ¨develop¨ wikipedia the people the readers of wikipedia will read shit. where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at ies mr know everything? feel free to block me again. i have no desire to write here any more.~0

5032~==another specific example====under genetic explanations wrn has written this to support these claims they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in iq . black–white–east asian differences in iq reaction time and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. in the united states significant blackwhite iq differences are observable at every age above years within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested in every region of the country and at every time since the invention of ability tests. . jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different iq subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability. from these and other findings they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis. . the rising heritability of iq with age within all races studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at % in infants rises to % in middle childhood and peaks at % in adulthood and studies showing the virtual disappearance . by adulthood of shared environmental effects on iq for example family income education and home environment with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in iq than with strangers from these studies they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for iq difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on iq to fully account for group differences.. studies of us comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races for blacks and for whites across the entire range of iqs despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examinedthis seems to be excessive detail. wrn has essentially recreated rushton/jensen arguments and placed citations in his citation. this essentially allows wrn to write an entire section as if it were incontrovertible based on various references without any possible response. the npov fact that should be reported is that rushton and jensen make some assertions not that they make some assertions and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up. if anything every one of their lines of evidence should be attributed directly to rushton and jensen as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the genetic hypothesis depending on the viewer. it seems very weaselly in any case. can we agree these four points should be removed from the article? comments? ==~0

5036~my c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a criticisms section. then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground. for the record i completely agree % that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders just as good if not better that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain task force that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches tth migraine cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin and inconclusive and controversial for nonmusculoskeletal disorders. part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for lbp. this is the most succint and precise summary there is. we can toss the reference in and call it a day. a majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence both in research and rd parties governments favours chiropractic care. we cant let ernst conclusions which have been rebutted and invalidated skew what is now generally accepted. notice the terms too generally etc.~0
5037~i found a better reference.in page theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women. of these only the first is common.and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous and per cent for monogamous unions.the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either. this had been sitting on the shelf for over years deep in the recesses of the basement. murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.~0

5048~yes i agree wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now. vitali has considered fighting huck after huck defends his cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching chisora. he wants to fight haye but haye wants to much money to make it happen clearly hes trying to cash out. that might be it for his career. since other pp boxers have more sections i dont see the issue with adding more for vitali. but we can decide that in the future after his next fight. for now there is only the chisora fight. given the slap in the prefight conference spitting in wladimirs face before the fight and brawling with haye in the postconference i think this is worthy of a headline. its also one of the most defining fights of vitalis career as he won it at an old age with only one arm.~0
5049~ redennis browns final warning i didnt mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. i didnt violate the final warning curtisnaito did multiple times. the exact wording of the warning was if either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility bludgeons a discussion violates wpidht acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of hours. at no point did i push the boundaries of civility bludgeon a discussion violate idht act in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. curtisnaito displayed the exact same kind of idht behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions and when told explicitly that he was violating dennis browns final warning he kept doing it.your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual when nothing i had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning was an offtopic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.i understand you dont like me but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly? 聖やや ~0

5062~ i was thinking about this last night and came to two conclusions first focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor if possible to global warming and denialism. dont tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous.. second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions. join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate. and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert. done the page is impregnable. take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer. using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end. barbara boxer is a politician. every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both. even more — and this is important — barabara boxer is not a runofthemill politician. it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. in short the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what? test. i intend to delete that one sometime soon too. i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thankyou to the editors who revert me every time they do so. or maybe a barnstar? i dunno some token of gratitude or other. •  ~0

5093~ not happy i am not happy with the tone of this comment you seem to be confused. firstly are you seriously saying that as product manager visualeditor team you are completely unable to give a useful answer to a question about what the plans for mathematics rendering are or what progress has been made against those plans? does mathematics rendering really have nothing whatsoever to do with visual editor? or is there some other reason why you prefer not to answer the question?secondly if you wanted to be helpful instead of airily alluding to the volunteers who maintain that extension you might have said who they are. who are the people to whom in your opinion i should address that question please?thirdly if you really wanted to be helpful and i am finding it hard to avoid the conclusion that you do not you might even have volunteered to pass the question on to the approriate people rather than batting it back so unhelpfully.once again if you engage constructively with the volunteer mathematics editor community it is likely to prove of benefit to the project. so far im seeing less of a serious attempt to engage and too much petty pointscoring. ~0
5094~ oh come on now ... how can you possibly justify this? unsourced widly undue and total wprecentism. i dont know how you can justify putting distribution in the article in the first place but even if it were included youve restricted it to the american comicbook industry in ignoring nonamerican comic books comic strips graphic novels webcomics etc etc etc as well as the history of the direct market and the system that preceded it.can you please explain why you are so desperate to fiddle with the article? it doesnt seem your motivation is to improve it or to find out even the basics of what youre adding.  🍁 ¡gobble ~0

5182~ the truth about the sinn féin ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party. how he broke the sinn féin constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn féin membership. and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. in section b. of the sinn féin constitution read as follows“no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. the adams leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis. its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle.b. shall not draw their salaries for personal use. parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser’s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as followsthat section b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the ard chomhairle. obviously motion infringes section b. section b. was in effect at the time this resolution was presented. its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure. he should have sought a majority decision to amend section b. in and returned in to propose entering leinster house. trying to amend section b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist county parliament” in the same resolution was a logical impossibility. can anybody say that the wording“that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle?clearly adams was in breach of section b. and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution .brian feeney in his book sinn féin turbulent years puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section b by introducing a motion in allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the sinn féin constitution. this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section b in any way. to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. in fact the line adams added in was superfluous as the sinn féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.of course its not illegal to amend or remove section b. section b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies. it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority. the reason for doing so could be many. perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic. in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason. but you~0

5222~for what purpose was the u.s census office reinterpreting a foreign census? my hunch is that spoken rusyn and western ukrainian are closely related. for example my father learned polish at home from his mother he was a pennsylvania coal miner and understood rusyn after working years underground. i remember him saying that the rusyns did not like to be referred to as ukrainians. if he were alive today he would understand this discussion. dr. franklin please cite a reliable source from the cold war era on this rusyn and ukrainian dispute we are having. here in new york the local rusyns and ukrainians are happy like peas in a pod see ukrainian americans in new york city. if you are in ny drop me a line and we can have lunch there. regards~0

5228~under such criteria you better be inserting notability templates into each and every unsourced article that exists. since we have had unsourced blps in wikipedia for years that is not sufficient criteria for determining if something is notable or not. the standard is if such could be found. there are already several sources in the article about several european groups in mexico such as the mennonites and spanish refugees. could the article be improved? definitely. but notability is not an issue except to those who beleive that europeans or whites do not or better stated should not exist in latin america.~0

5305~and paganismsouthgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university rejected catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition’ including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a ´ satru´ alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party. further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins. southgate believed that wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity’. another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate roman emperor julian ii.this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’. the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmler’s ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’ the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’. for southgate as for evola tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene. this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothicindustrial dark ambient black and ‘viking’ metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth. although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging ‘antiantiestablishment’ probush rightwing punk movement. although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’. southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.this is not simply cynical manipulation. southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. his fanzine tribal resonance ‘the voice of the racial avantgarde’ reveals southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’. through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’ southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance. by creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.the struggle for cultural heg~0

5370~i dont know the answer to this butlegally how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizens civil rights?i dont know if this is the section nelson was charged under in the federal case but if anyone could explain this i would appreciate it.you can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified thats really not my concern here since its a dead letter. im concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal. if the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice its not the first time. look at issei sagawa. part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isnt perfect and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted and that guilty people will be acquited from time to time. thats the price you pay for having a legal system in the end someone has to make the decision and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right. i dont think its going out on a limb to say that the sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.~0

5436~issuesonefortyone the reason why i removed your edits because they have following problemsit is graceland that is nd most visited place in the usa. not biltmore estate.the décor throughout the house has often been criticized is incorrect it has not been criticized by anyone. then you put up the quotes of albert goldman a fringe theorist on elvis presley and added them under gracelandbasement which is irrelevant.those conflicting reports about his death have no relevance on this article especially when they are disputed or rejected enough times. this is why this kind of content misleads and should be removed. i dont see any consensus for adding it on archives or previous discussion either. ~0

5488~ whole ariticle needs to br rewritten i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom. in jumps around in a chronological sense thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed. there is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of keith jonstone but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers moreover his importance is no where near as significant in the us as is the work of spolin shepherd sills and close and the rolenof io and the second city.the article in its present form looks like a hodgepodge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.a rewrite would also avoid some duplication.how does one initiate such a process? who selects the person to take the first stab at it? i would propose that michael golding of los angeles do the rewrite. he has a masters degree in improvisation from nyu personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre shepherd sills close halpern to name a few and is a professional writer his latest credit is for writing the film david shepherd a lifetime of improvisational theatre. any thoughts?~0

5495~ pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offlinehiim not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous.does this mean i hadnt registered? i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have. i always use my real name in signatures.and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link.thanksdennis bathorykitszbathorybathorythanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear. whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name. i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w. bush at least if its not already taken. wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently. all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself. thats what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym. it is not independently verified against some external identity database. and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia. we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials.by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathorykitzs. that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system. such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you. that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia. when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit. users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia. but those are all manual checks. there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.likewise no one can inherently trust the email address. the way internet domains are set up anyone could register and create any email name they wanted. like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority. and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.most people are honest. but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not. thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security. the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours. how can a bank know that youre really you? and how far can that trust be extended? under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable? how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible. unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate. anyway ill get off my soapbox now. thanks for your message.to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia. the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top. that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols. you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages. you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes . when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp.again welcome to wikipedia. talk ~0

5556~hi math. thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. i find it very interesting. her pictures of womens bodies as commodities are very disturbing while her photos of morrissey are beautiful. i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book but i couldnt order it from amazon apparently they cant ship it to my country.anyway i know what youre talking about information on linder and ludus is very hard to find. besides the ludus biography you quoted ive come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in the guardian article and here is a long and indepth articleher real name is linda mulvey. the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth liverpool and a bit on her background.i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article.besides the importance of being morrissey linder also appeared in southbank show on the smiths. what other magazine articles have you found about her? shes usually mentioned in connection with morrissey and even that is very rarely. the only magazine article i can think of is that infamous nick kent the face article on the smiths. there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance but its similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to plus some interesting quotes by richard boon and trotter. apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle that pete shelley wrote buzzcocks what do i get as a plea of unrequited love for her and that she inspired a lot of devotos early work. her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life besides cemetry gates shes mentioned in entries for miserable lie wonderful woman last night i dreamt that somebody loved me in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single and i wont share you. in the latter theres another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled crepuscule ludus restrospective the end of the note sounds very familiar oh linder. oh linder. ill see you sometime somewhere. however im not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again its not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours morrissey page is one of the examples but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so i dont know. ~0

5590~rsa labss now emc mit and acm are wrong? vquaker. i am used to accepting correction when it is due but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source rsa labs on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing. i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know it must be spurious. some people know that its better to get their legal information from government sources not wikipedia. if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide exposition or sanctioned resource then i believe the u.s. government would like to hear your ideas. further someone you know or knows you is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance. needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat. though i suspect you know this already. im not offended though just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard. i would ask you this if a user loses their smartcard i.e. cac and forgets their password with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person? there are organizations that will terminate you but i couldnt have said that in my expounding of the th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge. when we set out it was to provide reliable information if the mission has changed well who could tell? consider me a noncontributor from now onwe arent allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work it is an anathema. say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. i should expect nothing less after all i teach. what changed the tone was your dumbingdown and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone. smell? nonsequitur. you gave me things to read but im still waiting for you to cite wikipedias policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister. i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style organization and applicability be inline with one or more regulatory bodies?now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases do you have access to them elsevier jstor edas ieee springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them youre stuck in a google funk but i digress are full of references to fourth factor. that cash register key the manager uses when you return something yep someone you know. an thats been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful. i just didnt realize you alone set these standards. i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly. ~0

5649~moncrief do you even know what a shepherd is? i used to work on a cattle ranch so i know a bit about this stuff. to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep usually in flocks in the fields... unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others. the s werent biblical times. shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that downandout laborers got when they could get it. in fact thats an important part of proulxs story characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. afterwards ennis worked with cattle and jack worked most of his life in an office job not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark. however the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer the summer that so defined them. therefore id say that the relevant description especially in this paragraph discussing that summer would be shepherds. that however is more up for debate. i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. although anybody whos ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that thats just a circumlocution for shepherd. but since i dont want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page ill settle for that as a compromise. chris ~0

5685~the othello error ekman refers to the sheakspeares play of othello killing his wife who he suspected to love another man. all this based upon his wifes distress failing to listen to her alternative innocent explanations. the interpretation of behaviour. when a subject under questioning show signs of fear and/or distress it could indicate the subject is not telling the truth. the othello error refers to the fact that honest people may experience fear during questioning and show signs of fear while perfectly telling the truth. in essence you can not rely entirely on signs of fear as an indicator of truth or lie. you have to look beyond the signs.~0

5689~none beefart repliesthanks for you comments. few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles. i disagree with you about none. the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one. in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one. it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs. it has to be no one is a dinosaur. here are two examples from the oed e.j. howard except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable. p. rose people sought her... but none was a companion. however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from graham greene who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited. this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight. maybe i ought to as well . there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. e.g. none of the increase is due to.... here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing. i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase... ~0

5697~ is this map accurate? =i see some problems with this map it seems to me that this map only shows the very first homosapiens immigrations not the further ones... a for example regarding new zealand this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that i suppose to be the morioris while we know the maoris the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them were actually polinesian... b europe is shown being occupied by settlers from anatolia those were the certainly the paleoeuropeans... this map does not show the further occupation of europe by the indoeuropeans who originated in the caspian basin migrated to europe and pushed the paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.c the brazilian amerindians are not of colombian ancestry they are either of caribbean origin the caribs and arawaks or of paraguayannorthernargentine origin the tupiguaranis. the bulk of the amerindians who were in brazil about the time of the arrival of the portuguese were these tupiguaranis. they came from paraguay and spread all over the brazilian coast till the valley of the amazon river. when you show a map where brazilian amerindians are all coming from colombia you are showing a totally contradictory information. d the dravidians reached india from ethiopia to yemen from yemen to oman from oman to southeast iran from southeast iran to the valley of indus. what is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of india by the indoeuropeans from iran through bactria.e the hipothesis of ancient waves of paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of north america is ignored while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the mithocondrial gene x xenia among northamerican native americans.f this map also seems to ignore the australoid migrations to south america some people claim that the australoids have reached south america before the mongoloids due to some archeological findings in brazil.anyways i believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homosapiens show on that map are only the first the early migrations and the route of their early settling in india should be corrected. also i would suggest a second map showing further homosapiens migrations now including the maori migration from polinesia the correct migrations in south america and the settling of the indoeuropeans in europe.... r. alberto~0

5724~reverting to last known edit by me. the article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. if sysops examine the network log files they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from / truth sites and the vast majority of exit links go to / truth sites. therefore removing that information was damaging wikipedias reputation. visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that jones is currently involved in which of course includes everything relating to / that was on that page.using the ct term to describe / theories is ad hominem and also not npov and therefore not civil. anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not npov and ask them to not edit the / pages.as the zogby poll shows % of america believes the government is covering up / and % want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.for now on any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using wikipedia protocol.also even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation i do apologize for them. anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. i expect anyone and everyone to be civil.~0

5745~ mediation hello i am atyndall and i have volunteered to take on your mediation case during this discussion i will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. after having a look at the discussion above this is what i have foundquizzicalbee has been adding the sentence according to chesler the the u.s. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a u.s. citizen. hurmata has been reverting this back to she reports that the u.s. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. hurmata objects to quizzicalbees sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. qb objects saying that maybe in the s us citizenship could have been revoked by the us/afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. hurmata countered that the citation threat qb was referring to is not the one that was cited. qb states that there is no evidence disproving her claims so they are valid.could the involved users please place below to verify that this statement is correct or suggest why it is not correct? thankyou    talk  ~0

5776~ dear just plain bill please explain why you could ignore the fact that usermichael bednarek couldnt have answered at all and moreover revert as if you were usermichael bednarek and userspinningspark. please explain why you cannot wait and see for a whileonly hours as mentioned above. apparently your vandalism reverts have no reasonable reason as well as bednareks and spinningsparks because you spinningspark and bednarek have left the lead unsourced that looks like evil vandalism and cruel personal attack with baldfaced lies. please explain why you could ignore your obvious contradictionslies. please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be helpful as an encyclopediawpp. please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be written from a neutral point of viewwpp and why you have tried to force us stop kind and quickwitted human beings with common sense. it seemed that and userspinningspark are cruel nazis or facists unfortunately. the third pillar of wpp says wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit use modify and distribute. this means that wikipedias are not even admins private websites and that to revert other editors distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all. please explain why you can have been doing the contrary. the forth pillar of wpp says editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner. please explain why you can have been doing the opposite. the fifth pillar of wpp says wikipedia does not have firm rules. please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary. please explain why you can ignore all of wpp? please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. the important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords later becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down. please explain why you can leave the unsourced or sentence while unfairly accusing me of unsourced or. the or lead you have left is below usually refers to the frequency components of a timevarying signa. please explain why you can expresslie restore though in fact you ruined the lead apparently. please explain why you didnt edit positively at all when you are not satisfied with others edits. please explain why you cannot think your unreasonable deletings are obviously useless and harmful vandalism against other editors and readers. please explain why you cannot be responsible at all for the tagfor other uses see harmonic disambiguation in the article page harmonic. if you can explain these fifteen questions at oncewithin hours at the latest you have proved yourself to be the cruel personal attacker to be banned forever unfortunately. ~0

5778~so his summaries werent as antagonistic. so whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning. good to know. on to your second claim i still dont understand how i have a pattern of edit warring but olyeller doesnt when i added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence and olyeller repeatedly removed it for no valid reason and olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page. so its odd that falsifying summaries isnt considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. the only reason olyeller removed it is because he has a really big anticarbonator grudge. i once called him a thinskinned prick and he took it badly. he now confirms the validity of said appellation by obsessively searching for any of my edits and reverting them which is exactly what he did in this case. how is that not vandalism? ~0

5789~referring to her as catherine i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone living or dead by their st names on wp if a female had a title she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy or lady dudley for amy robsart even though lady amy was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become lady dudley until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amys life nor was she then lady amy dudley as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke. i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just amy throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles but was told it was against wp rules though i wasnt pointed to a link for it. noblewomen are usually called by their st names round here as far as i can see even when they have surnames are not of something mary boleyn is called mary not lady carey or lady stafford catherine neville is called catherine not the duchess of norfolk etc theyre not royals. as for males i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley. i was banging head on keyboard going but no one just says the king all the time or refers to them as plantagenet or keeps changing their titles ie henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as catherine throughout the article without her title appended? ive only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me as my main interest is british history i am quite confused.~0

5816~ lead whats there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize which the case at salvatore giunta is not. it simply copies whole sentances from the body text. as an editor we have to assess the article as it currently stands and not any hypothetical future stance. if the article grows then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. in any case the lead section i favored does indeed summarize the most important part the moh.in any case did you read wplead? the lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject but assert thier claim to notability. the two sentances i favored more than do that without being overly repetitive. wordsdeeds ~0

5840~ disruptive activity please stop your disruptive editing. if you continue to vandalize wikipedia as you did at paracetamol you may be blocked from editing. 🍌 email yeah so i add two interesting and important new relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the paracetamol page. these are removed because you guys dont like primary sources? this is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with wikipedia. my wife is pregnant. i for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. i would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the first do no harm idea. the fact that you wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. ive continued to run into this kind of thing. you would think that academic journals have taken over wikipedia. the idea that i have actually improved the article with my additions and that others can improve it further has completely escaped much of the wikipedia culture these days. wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. you guys are disgusting really. you are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created wikipedia in the first place. the fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply. im sorry that ive upset you but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. that is why weve written wpmedrs which i pointed to when i reverted you. there is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at wpwhymedrs. the fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results cant be transferred into clinical practise. medrs is no catch all but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. i would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically for example by having fda warnings automatically added.i understand it may feel as if youre being reverted by a faceless mass but i assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive. 🍌 email this isnt about my feelings it is about your behavior. you revert me with no reason then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. this is why wikipedia is dying cannibalizing its editors and edits in a kafkaesque farce. congratulations im sure your nodoubt proper and uplifting zyzzyxrd will be cited upon its demise. you may want to try and comprehend your own actions and not my feelings. see . ~0

5852~ as daft as it sounds yes if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wptruth wpverifable wprs wpnor and wpnor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. talk contrib as it says on my talk page i prefer to have discussions all in the same place. i am watching this page so please reply here. to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here. so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either youll insist on a source for that too? seriously you are mistaken on a few points. i think you need to read wpverify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace including everything in articles lists and captions must be verifiable. all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. emphasis added jeh note the distinction. you wrote if it cant be verified it gets removed. but first the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified. not only is it part of the definition of the term the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. so no we dont need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. and second except for blp issues wpv only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. this material didnt need a source and even if it did it isnt required to remove it right away. even for claims that really should have a citation to a wprs the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template. see templatecn. this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someones edit rather than simply reverting it. i suppose you could say well since i removed it its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source. yeah fine. so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs thats already there and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. no its not much work but consider does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? was it the best use of yours? and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future? also in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices. in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to sic. well that is true but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article nor even claim that such were wrong. so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. finally i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. after reading wpverify you should probably look at wpvandalismeven if misguided willfully against consensus or disruptive any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. edit warring over content is not vandalism. careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial detrimental but wellintentioned and vandalizing. mislabelling goodfaith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wpagf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it. in sum please be careful about undoing others edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wpverify. consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material. please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism. and you should never have intentions of editwarring so the statement that you dont have any here is troubling. why would you need to state such a thing if not for the possibility that you might have s~0

5861~what vandalism? jibba jabba you have two. btw what vandalism? communicator/kills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo? the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise. the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts. however the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots. obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time. ... dlomme //yup. communicator/kills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting. is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl? who cares? and believe me im no patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum. this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur. actually protection is not something to be taken lightly. being an admin and even though i am a diehard pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos. . farive nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere. protection this article is starting to get vandilized again. if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected. i wonder why vandilism is returning to it. get over it people the superbowls over so you want me to request semiprotection? communicator/kills bias?? the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots. whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given. when it gets to the part about the patriots winning superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them. ie under belichick the team went to three super bowls in four years... it should be consistant one way or the other.the sentence the patriots however were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii after winning the first games of their season. is very clumsily tacked on to the first section. i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev~0

5864~ wpfilm coordinator hey i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wpfilm concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. im a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. is it largely updating reviewing articles and aiding in the establishment of task forces at least as far as i can see? do coordinators generally specialize in various areas i.e. one handles task forces others reviewing or a combination of any such duties? if so i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status. if i was elected i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wpfilms scope and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort. that said i understand that im relatively new to the film project and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project. just curious as to your thoughts on the matter. cheers converse ~0

5901~ philosopher rfc philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead. this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career. note not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present. the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place. definitions obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article. philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ... anarchocapitalist anarchocapitalism ... is a political philosophy... voluntaryist voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy... athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy... primary source as stefan molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims. if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place. i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to. freedomain radio about page my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens. i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio. i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy. freedomain radio the show that molyneux hosts has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly universally preferable behaviour upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods? a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies. strong atheism the case for evacuating the middle ground article why i am a philosopher? video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy. an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts reality knowledge truth gods/religion ethics and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable. proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video philosophy questio~0

5903~ why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.i reject such a stance. i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial. where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth. this is wrong. wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is. any attempt to do that is original research.instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability. put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources. if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that. if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict. where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or pov on the topic at hand.i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. obviously is because some users jadger and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their pov thats not discussion about the npov edits. thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ ~0

5934~ warning i am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious and i am asking you kindly to back off as i am starting to get annoyed. i am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. you pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the palm sunday article. if you would simply do some basic fact checking this could all be avoidedmy change to lacon il was sourced via grazulis and you obviously reverted because you saw my username and didnt even check or research the validity of my edit. i would bet money that if any other user made that edit you wouldnt have reverted it. if you have this idea that i make willynilly edits with no basis then you are mistaken. i dig through hours online resources old newspaper archives books and pdf documents to find my information. i take pride in providing valuable detailed and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. all i ask is for you to trust me a little more and actually read the sources and information provided. sharkguy~0
5935~as i suspected complete nonsense. your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is. you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided. i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption. i am not a stupid person. i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick.you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability commentby the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.heres a few points for you to think on.wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.then lets consider the arbcom an article. what then is this articles content?hmm lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of? why members. so that means the content of the committee is its members. so an election is a decision on the content of this article.so.members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.you dont like that?wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.but arbcom is not an article. it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions.is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership? if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid? would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder? if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing? can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? the questions were politely put. they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom. they were not deferential. which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully. do not try to bully me.finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here. ~0

5944~ misleading reference to study? in the section on lead paint in art which i largely wrote someone added the followinglead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids often from fingerprints. as a result many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited. their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that wasnt absolutely clear. but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle dont usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections. and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artists paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead. normally flake white is used only by oil painters and theres no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. cooperstown is a wellrespected institution but as of now im sticking with the classic ralph mayer. flake white may get slightly yellowish after centuries but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. if someone has more information on this please mention it here otherwise when i come back im going to delete that paragraph or water it down no pun intended.~0

5947~christian arabshi. could you please stop enforcing the category christian arabs on non arabic christians living in the middle east? this is wrong. we middleeastern christians though not arabs have gone through arabization and that needs to stop. we are not arabs. we have our own ethnicity and we shouldnt be forced to be called christian arabs. if a christian european is born in the middle east should he be called a christian arab because of that reason alone? please understand they are syriac christians i.e. of assyrian ancestry and most of them speak aramaic though a lot of them are forgetting it. as someone who speaks aramaic you should respect this fact and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because theyre in the middle east. we are not closely related to the arabs from saudiarabia. we have our own ethnicity please stop forcing upon us some alien arab ethnicity. thats oppression. talk jun utc~0

5966~with over college students studying abroad every year theres bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around. while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.misconception studying abroad is very expensive.truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad. lets say the tuition at your school is $ per semester and room and board is another $. now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry. you are now well over $ for the semester. well all but one of our programs in spain is under $ per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.tabmisconception i cant use my financial aid to study abroad.truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans pell grants etc. can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well. it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money.truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program. the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had. if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends. since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year its a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. misconception ill be so busy with schoolwork that i wont get time to see the country im in.truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about + photos from a long list of countries. students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad.truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then its true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad. if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine. the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.misconception most of the world hates americans so i wont be safe.truth theres no doubt that there are a lot of people who dont like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people. if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous. there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe. go to the u.s. state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.studying abroad is a onceinalifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of. before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts. i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you youll be hopping the first flight abroad.one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad. here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countriesstudy abroad spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid salamanca and sevilla. study abroad england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london. study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence. study abroad france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aixenprovence and avignon. ~0

5999~perhaps the single most potent way to balance the article in line w/ jimbos comments would be to expand discussion of guevaras admission that during the missile crisis had he and castro controlled the missiles they would have fired them onto american cities as soon as the blockade started. he would have regarded this as a beautiful death despite having killed tens of millions of innocent americans despite the annihilation of cuba and probably despite a global nuclear holocaust killing billions and destroying civilization. i am hoping you will expand the two sentences currently dealing with this and that you will summarize the incident in the intro. ~0
