4000,4000,trevithj the reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention setpoints errors and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market. the remarks of black are perfectly clear and also make no mention of these factors nor do his patents. they are understandable as he intended them the use of feedback bypasses the inadequacies of the nonlinear variable and uncontrollable properties of the largegain open loop amplifier as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closedloop gain to be set at /β as fixed by a resistor divider for example by making the closedloop gain independent entirely of the openloop gain. i dont think you fully appreciate the simple algebra that governs this circuit. ,0
4001,4001,this statement the document reveals that the de facto government existing since these unlawful and illegal acts appears to be a subversive organization in contradistinction to the claim that the u.s. government is an example of representative government in the world is what the document reveals. that is not an unneutral statement. the document itself is not a neutral document. is that the problem? ,0

4009,4009,im pretty sure i wish i could find more history about it that the the toponym river plate is a relative neologism coined in the british empire esp. in england perhaps as little as a century or so ago. youre surety is misplaced. the british have been calling it river plate since drake. with the barest minimum of research i counter your assertion with the fact that a book entitled a narrative of the operations of a small british force under the command of brigadiergeneral sir samuel auchmuty employed in the reduction of monte video on the river plate a.d. . by a field officer on the staff. illustrated with a plan of the operations. was published in . see samuel auchmuty. ,0

4013,4013,i cant quite figure it out. the system of numbering dynasties was developed by manetho in the thirtieth dynasty so it isnt often applied to later dynasties. but it looks like the second period of achamenid rule following the thirtieth dynasty is sometimes called the thirtyfirst dynasty. one might count the ptolemies as the thirtysecond dynasty but i dont know if any reliable sources do so. theyre either called the ptolemaic dynasty or the ptolemies or the lagides. and counting them as number instead of would ignore the argead dynasty alexander the great his son alexander iv of macedon and philip iii arrhidaeus which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties. i cant see any reason for counting the ptolemies as number . unless sources address the issue i think attempts to give the ptolemies a number should be left out of the article. ,0

4022,4022,you know what forget it. the guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why except of course to start shouting has reported me for not being civil. how ironic is that. rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better ill simply point out that in the current version even after you read the entire first paragraph you still dont have a clue why this article exists. you do find out what marco rodríguez does for a living though. so yay for that. i guess once you get to the end you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal but thats assuming you havent fallen asleep or shot yourself having read the same four words brazil germany biggest loss and their million variants multiple times. seriously if people here think whats currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. its not quite garbage but its not good. and please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are unencyclopedic frankly you couldnt be more wrong. theres no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match both now and in years time. if you dont want it to be in this one please think of a better reason than unencyclopedic if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.that said on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article heres what the opening should look like if youre trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.brazil – germany was the shock result of the first semifinal of the fifa world cup mens international football tournament played on july at the estádio mineirão in belo horizonte brazil. it broke brazils match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to and equalled their biggest margin of defeat tied with a – loss to uruguay in leading it to be described as a national humiliation. the game also saw germany score the most goals in world cup history their overtaking brazils . their second goal meant germanys miroslav klose reached world cup goals overtaking brazils ronaldo as the tournaments alltime record goalscorer. the game was subsequently referred to by the press as the mineirazo evoking the spirit of the maracanazo in which brazil unexpectedly lost the fifa world cup on home soil to uruguay.,0

4025,4025,dude seriously you need to relax a bit. life isn’t all about research and fact hunting. you went crazy when you saw a hoax page and did hours of research into it. it was a blatant hoax and it was just a childish game which you got involved in. i hope you’re happy that you spotted the hoax but anyone could have done it. you even got your friend on the case to do research into it i agree that wikipedia has no place for rubbish but it’s the administrator’s job to delete the rubbish. i think at the end of the day youve got to have fun and researching about some fake person isnt the way to do it. i think to a degree everyone’s idea of fun is different but almost everyone in this world will agree that what you did wasnt it. i’d prefer to play scrabble with arabic letters than research into a prank if you want a debate then i’ll be on my user page i always enjoy having chats with you that is fun,0
4026,4026, my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion page....l nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear salvioyou have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period.may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az seric and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds.there is a constant undermining of the city´s greek identity i.e. whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army.the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. on the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled trnc.it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture w.r.t the city. the trnc is illegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus. this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character.this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.in the light of all of this i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self. furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory.marcobadotti talk ,0
4027,4027,so his summaries werent as antagonistic. so whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning. good to know. on to your second claim i still dont understand how i have a pattern of edit warring but olyeller doesnt when i added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence and olyeller repeatedly removed it for no valid reason and olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page. so its odd that falsifying summaries isnt considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. the only reason olyeller removed it is because he has a really big anticarbonator grudge. i once called him a thinskinned prick and he took it badly. he now confirms the validity of said appellation by obsessively searching for any of my edits and reverting them which is exactly what he did in this case. how is that not vandalism? ,0

4037,4037, request regarding current rfar/clarification there is an open request for clarification regarding a sanction decided at wikipediaarbitration/requests/case/abdwilliam m. connolley see live link or permanent link. is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. i agree with him and unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised i support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. my reason for this it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at rfar/clarification and that i was blocked while this request was pending for comments made in the request itself is an additional impediment.there is no need for extra debate or argument. i have stated that i am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which i interpreted the sanction pending clarification by arbcomm. so the status quo is that the restriction is tight though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. i do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits and id argue that he did so consider. i accepted sandsteins decision clarification as a neutral administrator pending arbcomm review not future perfects who was already involved and i had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.i will continue to respect sandsteins tightening as standing and binding on me and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated and it did permit legitimate comment before arbcomm when i am an originating party as is normal. normally i can having filed respond there to comments from other editors also made there which is what i did. arbcomm specifically allowed me to originate a case and if im clearly involved as well i see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.i will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors and i will avoid in such a filing if it happens unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. obviously if i file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin i will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required which would only mention other disputes peripherally and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.i hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual rfar than there has been to the existing rfar/clarification which as it stands includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material i filed. its been pointed out by with clerk attention requested and nothing was done. nevertheless if the request is closed without action its moot. the real point here is that if clerks were following filings before arbcomm surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved and possibly the editor warned. ,0

4043,4043,perhaps the single most potent way to balance the article in line w/ jimbos comments would be to expand discussion of guevaras admission that during the missile crisis had he and castro controlled the missiles they would have fired them onto american cities as soon as the blockade started. he would have regarded this as a beautiful death despite having killed tens of millions of innocent americans despite the annihilation of cuba and probably despite a global nuclear holocaust killing billions and destroying civilization. i am hoping you will expand the two sentences currently dealing with this and that you will summarize the incident in the intro. ,0

4092,4092,theyre describe themselves as conservatives not farrightists. you cant take one source a newspaper? we all know that newspapers all have liberal agendas and describe them as such although i do sincerely believe they are a fascists. bottomline is they should be described as they describe themselves not as one newspaper does. a journalist is just one man with one opinion.,0

4094,4094,march utcyes the presentation of god and cosmology in tub is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. if one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way i can think of to describe it npov. npov though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship origin and unusual unique presentation that has caused various types of pov to surface in debate true not true religion philosophy etc. i searched in some online libraries at the library of congress and even wrote to the urantia foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. so far i found it listed under scientific religion religion nonfiction cults and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the loc. the book itself says it is an epochal revelation which is the fifth to the planet. it describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding god deity and divinity. religious science scientific religion esoteric cosmology religious cosmology what? perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article while increasing it at the same time i think. what are your thoughts? you know if we wrote that the urantia book is an epochal revelation containing religioscientific cosmology... there would then start more pov debating. ,0

4096,4096,what vandalism? jibba jabba you have two. btw what vandalism? communicator/kills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo? the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise. the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts. however the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots. obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time. ... dlomme //yup. communicator/kills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting. is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl? who cares? and believe me im no patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum. this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur. actually protection is not something to be taken lightly. being an admin and even though i am a diehard pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos. . farive nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere. protection this article is starting to get vandilized again. if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected. i wonder why vandilism is returning to it. get over it people the superbowls over so you want me to request semiprotection? communicator/kills bias?? the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots. whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given. when it gets to the part about the patriots winning superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them. ie under belichick the team went to three super bowls in four years... it should be consistant one way or the other.the sentence the patriots however were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii after winning the first games of their season. is very clumsily tacked on to the first section. i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev,0

4098,4098,indeed “learning curve.” i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully off i wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like arbcom’s wiki. that wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path. that took some reading and trial error. mediawiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan. it’s—like—about openness. ♬” the thing is those who don’t care to think about security wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing. however those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by i.p. then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what i did to file. like many things i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki. moreover installing imagemagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using ftp it’s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like templatext template template/doc templatehilite templatenbhyph templatenowrap and templatext. i think i have all the gottahaves now. i was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so i’m fond of them.i can’t complain about free stuff. mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $. i’ll take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day.,0

4124,4124,well i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article. it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress. i have two problems first it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in to science as a specifically western project. second although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge the history of science is rather more complicated than that.one way to deal with this if others find my criticisms valid is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck etc on the one hand and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other. for example i think everyone agrees that aristotle newton einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims. id hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of say thomas kuhn and bruno latour could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously as well as the claims of those with opposing views.i am glad ed has begun this article it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. sr,0

4175,4175,i noticed at the time that tango reinserted the material you blocked me for adding to giles hattersley but didnt think anything more of it distracted as i was dealing with my own blocking. now ive just seen elsewhere that you blocked him aswell. subsequently reading the opinions at his talk page where he is unblocked after one hour especially from other admins over what constitutes a personal attack i am less than happy at how i got shafted over this incident in which you have still failed to show i was intentionally attacking giano you seem to have absolutely no shame in levelling the same theory at tango an editor registered since dec that you did to me that the simple fact we are experienced editors that would have never seen a users name linked in an article i am still entirely unconvinced this is even true especially for wikipedia related text but i have not researched it we just should have known it was considered a personal attack blockable after no warning after making one edit/revert. like i said i would be willing to take it as ignorance is no defence if this appeared in any policy text that i had just missed. and judging by his unblock request he was not mistaken about what he was readding. so quite clearly you are attributing some malicious motive to me that you arent to tango. had i known of that discussion at the time i have a good idea that things might have gone differently for me. its not like i can do sod all about it now.,0

4200,4200,senior descendant of victoria albert? is he really the senior maleline dynastic descendant of victoria albert? prince richard duke of gloucester is the most senior maleline male descendant of victoria albert as he is the surviving son of prince henry duke of gloucester and as the dukes two elder brothers edward and albert who reigned as george vi had no sons is since the death of his elder brother william in the senior maleline male grandchild of george v who was the surviving son of edward vii the first son of victoria albert. prince andreas is a descendant of leopold duke of albany who was victoria and alberts fourth son and edward viis youngest brother. thus he cant be considered as the senior maleline descendant of victoria and albert but through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of coburg by the future edward vii and the prince arthur duke of connaught he is the current titular duke and thus is with no doubt the head of the house of saxecoburg and gotha. nonethelles his british cousins from the windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. we can say that prince andreas is the senior maleline descendant of prince albert in right of the former realm of saxecoburg and gotha as the elder lines of his descendants thourgh edward vii and arthur duke of connaught now extinct in maleline renounced their rights to it but definitely he is not prince alberts senior maleline descendant in general.,0

4220,4220, response to third opinion requesthi im here to give your third opinion. i think its important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions. its not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards. it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused. theres no dash key on my keyboard. i know how to make a dash however —. but i do web dev and work for a printing company. and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and. i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and im writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page. so in my mind the question is whether this is a misconception or just ignorance. i believe that to properly call something a misconception it must be believed to be a rule when in fact such a rule is not correct. ive never heard anyone say just use hyphens for everything. it has only become the default because we have no dash keys. so i would lean toward excluding this entry unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes not just misconceptions. hope this helps. ,0

4222,4222,i was just released from prison on december . during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike. actually and / days started pounds ended up an estimated pounds. generally i drank two cups of milk in the morning and drank water as needed. i was never forcefed. nor oddly enough was i ever hungry or in appreciable discomfort. i was examined almost daily by prison medical staff. probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the bodys electrolytes calcium potassium sodium magnesium phosphate and to consume just enough aminoacids to supply neurotransmitters. if you merely drink water after a couple weeks youll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance and youll feel terrible. most people attribute this to not eating but i learned that its actually due to the electrolyte imbalance not the lack of calories. at the time the longest hunger strike id ever heard of was referred to in the capote book in cold blood by perry smith in the early s days. i could probably have gone two more months. ,0

4255,4255,thank you all well all improve the wikipedia in dear all thanks for the warm wishes and all the emails that came in while i was at the new years vacation.now that i checked back for what has been going on in the last ten days while i was away the situation seems hopeful indeed. the bunch of scandalous action inspired by the secretive plottings are still being discusses and widely condemned and i see i see a strong momentum of the community of the wikipedia editors to finally put a decisive end to the secretive activity at the closed channels followed by the drastically insulting onwiki actions. i am also hopeful that the new arbcom will act on the recent developments. happy new to all ,0

4257,4257,actually what we were referring to as the lead is the lead statement for the history section. sitush has himself mentioned here that andre wink is reliable and we both had reached consensus on tej ram sharmas statements in our earlier discussions. now in his absence if you have any valid reason to remove reliably sourced content you are welcome to discuss. in fact i have great faith on you as a logical and neutral editor. please note that sitush could not come up with any counter opinion as evident from the above discussions. it would be great if sitush joins back the discussions. but since he has not left any message therefore we have to move on. please go through the sources cited and let me know if you have any issues. thanks.,0
4258,4258, i feel like i cant improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved the person i said it to and who did the block hours after the conversation was over. if as said that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong. when i posted that message and i still havent heard from the block admin that its content was the issue i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal human to human level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person rather than having us both resort to the standard drawnout wikiprocedures. so far at least onwiki that editor has had no reaction to what i said while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions and me only able to appeal on this page.,0

4310,4310,there are many inaccurate statements being posted here. far too many i dont have time to correct all of them. the bnp was modernised by nick griffin and has no links to holocaust denial or nazism. digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant. you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories. during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that? another example the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis. so they went from being antidrug to prodrug. the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial. secondly the comment about nick griffin and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antibnpers. what nick actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden. likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the nazis. also the last claim modern bnp members sieg heil i presume was a comical claim. it has no basis in fact. bnp are strongly against nazism and fascism. if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. is that democratic? you might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently.,0

4337,4337,the books of maccabees and the gospels refer to the land and nation as israel throughout this period and the term is still used in acts. the hasmonean kingdom was certainly not called judaea as this ia a latinized name and the hasmoneans are prior to the roman period. similarly as explained in the article it was only after herod the great that the roman expanded the usage of their term judaea to include more or less the entire region that herod had ruled. maccabees and the nt are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as israel for a modern academic publication secondary source see for example king herod a persecuted persecutor a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography by aryeh kasher eliezer witztum walter de gruyter where herod is clearly referred to as king of israel and e.g. a survey of israels history by leon james wood david obrien zondervan which refers to the hasmonean ruling over israel or say the holocaust roots history and aftermath david crowe westview press which similarly speaks of hasmonean israel. ,0

4401,4401, may utcas far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore. thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the crossover connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology. as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe only star wars takes place in an entirely different futurepast element basically a universe that predates that of the earth. and tolkiens universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm the same applies to dungeons dragons world of warcraft and warhammer. however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c.s. lewis and hans christian anderson/brothers grimm. harry potters world also doesnt tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen. and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tiein is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesnt the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present. perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole. piecraft ,0

4403,4403,so far nobodys reverted me so that gives me hope. meantime let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. in recent years wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers clients and others considering doing business with someone. naturally the one doing the vetting has the lions share of responsibility in judging an entrys reliability and supplementing it with other research. that said do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents as far as possible an accurate wellrounded picture of the subject? in the case of ms. caesar i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny. what are your thoughts? ,0

4426,4426, musings hey fridaywhile blocked the past two days i read through your subpages. things like /admin etc. they are greatim burning out on this project editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past ive received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me. i also saw that im not the only one whos been on the receiving end of this. ive seen it all but its too long to go into here. im not sure if these are new trends or just something i havent spent the time to look into before. mere editors really have little recourse in this. filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past. it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an outofline editor. filing against an admin would i assume be much much worse. admins seem to behave like innercity police with their wall of silence.a lot of your comments show that youve noticed the same happenings. in an ideal world i think you are right people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen. i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies. we need to define what something like disruption is. when someone is blocked for a personal attack the diff should be included. that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change weve tried the trust admins to do what is right. it has failed. ,0
4427,4427,fair use rationale for imageatozbutterfinger.jpgthanks for uploading or contributing to imageatozbutterfinger.jpg. i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. – ,0

4429,4429, and use the confusing redundent yet common phrase north america... not refering to the continent. either of two reasonsa desire to place the united states last on the list by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find.simply an oversight. well nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u.n. subregions. its amazing that this list puts the united states last even though it has most of the people and / of the area. is someone trying to deemphasize americas importance? no its just in alphabetical order. talk about... any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states?? yes in the human geography section namely the rd paragraph. other related terms are also treated in that sxn. talk central americans are not north americans we are own people and we are not northerners. we are seperate from them and are nothing like them you can try to correct me but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down and sometimes other ignorant groups of people. i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this. i dont care what the white man tells us. theyre not us. we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be. this is just another way of bringing us down. i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us. if we have been living here for the longest time should it not be us who decides who we want to be? tito a. martĩnezthis is a lovely essay but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling. central america happens to be located in north america so central americans are north americans its a geographical thing not a cultural thing. perhaps youre thinking of latin america and anglo america? actually tito can undeclare himself. if youll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america you will see that spanish language defines north americas southernmost country as mexico. esnorteamérica redirects to esamérica del norte which lists the lists the following political units in north to south ordergreenlandcanadaunited statesmexiconote that central america is not on this listwilyd is also right as far as english language goes. north america includes mexico and central america. i think america terminology should provide a better explanation than it currently does. a section on english vs. spanish terminology would help. i dont speak spanish but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. maybe ill recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this. okay but ill claim the fatal flaw here is this américa del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america. tito may not be a norteamericano although i dont think he declares himself here either doesnt spanish have an equivilent to lacademie? but hes still north american. actually i dont think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans. his country if its in central america is a part of the north american continent but the cultural division is what hes concerned about. want to help me update america terminology? i think america terminology reflects correct english usage. maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints although im actively involved in that article and know itll get shot down as original research. roughly speaking there arent political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america not that im convinced the term exists in contrast,0

4440,4440, may utcprince felix of schwarzenburg is at the right location. his uncle and then his cousin was the fürst while felixs position all of his life was that of a prinz this distinction is tougher for families where all used fürst like wrede and also titles like herzog and graf but it is easily determined. i am as certain as you are about alfred iii because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals other than the heinrichs reuss were the heads of houses and families. friedrich johannes jacob celestin von schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway he was zu not von. he was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also the prince john adolph ii. i dont mind leaving the german von or zu for princes of territories if the title isnt used. for instance felix zu schwarzenburg and prince felix of schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. adolph von auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source i have gives adolphs title as fürst which wouldnt make sense. i would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. prince karl of auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the fürst but again i would ask on the page. charles ,0

4444,4444,speedy deletion of vanilla french band a tag has been placed on vanilla french band requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a band but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for musical topics. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. lastly please note that if the article does get deleted you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you. ,0

4457,4457, recap i decided to withhold further comment until i had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. i am delaying a trip this morning so that i can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.your supporting statement for deletion is as follows the result was delete. the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic and i have counted those opinions as being from userjulie dancer. kevin talk as for the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm... in reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance. within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by at that other algorithms exist namely examples of relevant works are a fast bottomup decision tree pruning algorithm with nearoptimal generalization and an efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees. which are capable of performing the function the article title namesif this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.in anticipation of these other algorithms being added i immediately changed the body of the text to read the algorithm used for this purpose... to one algorithm used for this purpose... since i do not now have access to the articles history as the result of your deletion i can not give you the exact date and time. however it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. incidentally it has been suggested by a professor at cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.normally as a wikipedia user i would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the wikipedia was setup this way. the wikipedia still claims to be ...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. the impression i have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. they simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. as for ...references not supporting the notability of the subject you can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. all of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which i deferred. just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. i know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.as for the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... this shows you did not read or comprehend the response i made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. i explained that each of the user names were created so that i could track the use of my own resources better similar to the need on the part of the wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots but currently i am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the wikipedia and mining it off line.since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w,0

4471,4471,just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.in some cases it is probably appropriate and actually used just like a surname in a legitimate but different broader sense than that used by our surname article and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere by the person. thats probably especially true of radio personalities with an onair name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name ive seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names. but as a general rule no. some like annmargret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. the problem of course is that our articles especially the stubs and substubs often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on. if it is mary lou or something of the sort common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself it should clearly be under m in any category the redirect which should be there or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful. but in between there is a huge variety that youll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories and there are lots of them. even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesnt even appear in the articles own name. ,0

4480,4480, npov dispute just so this isnt lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article. in my interpretation the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrases usage and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. also generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov. the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version we should go through the diff line by line. did someone ever justify those massive changes? though some of them were good. t ,0

4495,4495,thats the common expression on internet fora for followers of judaism and citizens of israel who push for certain issues to be seen their way.the fact of the matter is that jerusalem is not the internationally recognized capital of israel. its status is yet to be determinded in negotiations with a future palestinianarab government of an independent and unoccupied palestine. the personal opinions of jews or israelis who want to depict the situation in a way sympathetic to them for obvious reasons cannot dictate the content of an internationally accessible article on wikipedia. this is no propaganda platform and the want to post their minority opinion they should mark it as that.,0
4496,4496,response to the disappearance of madeleine mccanni reverted your edit because you give partial information not because of the wording i prefer. what parts do not make sense? the ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? stop saying it is bad english if it was just that youd fix it without removing information.garcia added that when the pj is criticized then the british police are also criticized because of their close cooperation what you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the portuguese article it is not just close cooperation it was created a joint working group right from the start with the british police. this is why the british police are also criticized. just close cooperation they have with the interpol the europol and other police organizations. no working group was created with them. i hope it is clear. several unfair critics were made to the methodology used by the portuguese police. garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by portuguese and british police. other facts indirectly related to the different methodologypersonnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as forging evidence he gonçalo amaral was the victim of personal attacks by the british media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman but also attacked him as a human being. portugal has unsolved cases of missing children under including madeleine.in spite of all the resources available and the different methodology the uk has unsolved cases of missing children under in the last four years.national missing persons bureau. it seems that the british methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. besides thisthe uk has a serious problem with child trafficking a serious problem with african children that just go missing no criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the control risks group hired by the mcanns since may. the investigation of the pj weve stated all along has the most likely chance of us finding her something made them change their minds?the use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with childrens abduction and trafficking that the uk has. i hope it was clearly written and the parts of it do not make sense start to make sense.i am going to revert the edit you are welcome to correct any bad english not the information.i am sure my portuguese is better than yours. ,0

4528,4528,the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. i would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. i.e. “situational factors such as luck compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like i mentioned above. maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words i.e. change “social perceiver” > “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. instead of a “in the real world” i would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. this would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. overall i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate. aside from the few things that i’ve mentioned i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting.,0

4576,4576,ndpaffiliatedi added a fact tag to the fourtimesreinserted modifier ndpaffiliated to the mention of bill tieleman other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty nor are publishers such as canwest which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the bc liberal party also one of the partys major financial contributors. its not that tieleman isnt an ndper but his credentials go beyond his ndp politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party also. im responding partly also to this edit by . ive puzzled long and hard over my own realworld coi on bc political articles but i see no reason to recuse myself from participation in bc political articles though generally i give them as wide a berth as possible but when i recognize pov political activity/wording as a responsible wikipedian i cant not say something about it or challenge the povism and coi/spin edits when i see them. my interest here is to prevent wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine of any party and to make sure wikipedia principles are observed particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect wikipedia guidelines or concepts like wpnpov. in the case of this item about bc rail theres lots missing including the search of the clarkmarrissen home during the opening of the investigation and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case. but theres also lots of other commentators particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like sean holman laila yuile and bc mary who have similarly spoken out about clarks involvement in the bc rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public and of the informed media. she may have been out of teh way for the hst fracas and the big media have pronounced her clean of that but he big media also have maintained a veil of silence over bc rail. the current text says that she resigned for family reasons but its wellcitable that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the bc rail affair. and about the tieleman thing unless every time conservativeaffiliated columnists or bc liberalaffiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims often false its not fair to single out tieleman for this thats the reason for the cite tag tielemans own byline says only bill tieleman is one of bcs best known communicators political commentators and strategists. bill writes a politics column tuesdays in hours newspaper and the tyee online magazine. bill has been communications director in the b.c. premiers office and at the bc federation of labour. bill owns west star communications a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour business nonprofits and government. and frankly seeing whats going on with the ndp and teh things the party council/james supporter types have been calling him he may not be ndpaffiliated much longer.... ,0

4587,4587, ive come across variations on draughts as ive always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variationsdammspiel thats what the manual called it i think its also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue.turkish checkers similar settup to dammspiel/damenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares youd use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules.one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts dagger draughts or kings.played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts.i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man cant take a king. apparently according to this page thats the rules in italian draughts.,0

4604,4604,=colorb>coldplay expért lets talk this talk page is for discussing the article not world war ii history in general. summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences. my edit stating that as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement. this is not stalins arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the abraham lincoln brigade. prior to the francobritish assisted nazi sudetenland grab relations between nazi germany and soviet union were icy. when the nazis were declaring war on czechoslovakia the ussr was hard at work putting together an antinazi coalition. only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked antislavic aggression did the soviets begin to look for other allies. there is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event. this is not a motive its a statement of facts. if there are no more objections i will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect. respectfully disagree. the statement as a result of the francobritish action on czechoslovakia the molotovribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically. one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antihitlers coalition. another school believes that the only stalins aim was the alliance with hitler. the third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory. the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars. we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. we have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources hitlers occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr uk and france and could lead to signing of antihitler triple alliance. in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. had chamberlain and stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had ribbentrop been little bit less active wwii could be this is not a motive its a statement of facts. no. all these facts had already been in the article before your edits. your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote. in addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. try to follow this unwritten rule. that saves a lot of time and efforts. as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events. what nick said also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia ussr would have intervened as well. ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia. ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert. after the seizure of czechoslovakia the ussr held the uk partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the french as allies. if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

4608,4608, a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi. lately ive seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man. i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people. he seems to spread his antipolish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazism in europe and racism against poles. he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation. thank you so much for taking care of him and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. however now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different. this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of nazi germany war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi crimes against the polish nation invasion of poland collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazism and race untermensch master race white supremacy racial hygiene nuremberg laws aryan race aryanization aryan paragraph honorary aryan white nationalism holocaust victims racialsegregation nazi germany persecution of black people in nazi germany occupation of poland – polish decrees kidnapping of children by nazi germany forced labour under german rule during world war ii extermination through labor antipolish sentiment antislavic sentiment polish question polish joke ahnenpass anschluss lebensraum rassenschande adolf hitler nazism racism scientific racism themes in nazi propaganda germanisation reverse racism relations between nazi germany and the arab world glossary of nazi germanythis guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or nonaryans by the nazis. in fact the only aryanlooking poles that were accepted by nazi germany at the time were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like .% of the whole nation. the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the naziruled nation and were treated only slightly better that the jews. this guy he spreads lies all across wikipedia therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions diannaa. if youd need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed just tell me. i will also try to patrol the articles about poles. ,0
4609,4609,sir my meager edits were factual direct authors quotes and in context. docs edits were and remain out of context and reflect that he never read the articles he is mentioning which puts the procedure in a negative light. i am sorry to ask but have you read the information to see the actual facts? vandalism by the wiki definition speaks to the repetitive introduction of inaccurate information for no constructive purpose. please review my posts and show me what was inaccurate or out of context. i am not afraid to admit when i am wrong. i have had a number of physicians and lay people review the history and they were also amazed and dismayed as i was. you need to stop making this personal and focus on the published facts otherwise wiki as a resource is doomed. finally i am the just the last in a long line of contributors both individuals and corporations that have questioned his motives and accuracy. questions make many feel uncomfortable. i have also privately shared my exact written comments to doc with some colleagues both in the us the eu and canada and i was told by everyone that i was spot on. sorry again for all the trouble.,0
4610,4610, good policy suggestion on class assignments. my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. i think your looks like a good idea and i support it. its especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced thoughtful edits to psychology articles here as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. keep up the good work. talk an appology is in order dear colini am not sure if you will have the chance to read this or if youll have a moment to respond but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article. however before i go any further may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. i will not try to make excuses for my actions nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them. i realise and no doubt others will too that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t. and most importantly i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. though i can understand where you are coming from i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the longrun. i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge please do not blackout our privaleges to use and edit articles. let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school. looking to make this a better placecivcodex thanks. we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia. what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate. talk · contribs · email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page. °talk proposed new policy id like to advertise this very draft proposed new policy . comments please. °talk i think the central dillema is this a student could make a poorquality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. if the grading rubric was accurate a student would receive or negative credit. my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment increase their wikipedia knowedge and improve the grading rubrics themselves. im fairly proud of education programsaint louis university/signal transduction sp which i helped write. you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re how the community reacts to profs and students. the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies in the first place and we are often more unkind than necessary in the second. i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt. –  + barnstars { style=border px solid gray backgroundcolor fdfferowspan= valign=middle rowspan= style=fontsize xlarge padding verticalalign middle height .em the barnstar,0

4620,4620,i looked at the vandalism page and i have not vandalized the big o and dukes page.vandalism is any addition removal or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of wikipedia. the most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor page blanking or the insertion of nonsense into articles.any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism. even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. for example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — its just not helpful and should be removed or restated. not all vandalism is obvious nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial detrimental but well intended or outright vandalism.committing blatant vandalism violates wikipedia policy. if you find that another user has vandalized wikipedia you should revert the changes and warn the user see below for specific instructions. users who vandalize wikipedia repeatedly despite warnings to stop should be reported to wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism and administrators may block them.,0
4621,4621,as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to. it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in not polesti. raf bomber command used an attack by the af to attack this target.the days loses were as already given. specifically spitfire claims were not discussed so the spitfires percentage of the kill total is unknown which is conveyed in the article.more importantly citations have been given for for the order of battle figures. your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. oob are given in lists as you should know so your give me a quote tone is rather silly. caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. he gives known strength returns. as for total german day fighter strength again this estimated by caldwell as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete. he points out and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september . in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time while alone were available for combat in the west. german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time. even considering that all e.f fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts negating even the med. theatre. so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false. ,0

4634,4634, narciso yepes please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. yepes collaborated with ramirez not bernabe to invent his guitar. bernabe an apprentice of ramirez later formed his own shop and yepes subsequently played a bernabe string. as for your comment about yepess hands this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of yepes. i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available depending on what best served the music. do you have these proofs??? no. so please stick to what you actually know. fyi yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first strings d together with the low g on the th string by using the left hand thumb. again we have the proof of this. it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... your discussion at narciso yepes first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for yepess death. and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious...second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and yepes invented his tenstring guitar. as i said bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then but the first yepestype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar. moreover ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar. this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical. it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings. you want a verifiable source? here ramirez iii jose. . the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar. bold strummer. pp. . isbn third i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar. furthermore yepes frequently uses the th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor th higher than the th string. moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions. being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepess entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. this has nothing to do with yepess own performance practice on his instrument. as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepess leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about. yepes even frets a and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing.,0

4638,4638,the liber pontificalis is not sacred scripture and not i but the source quoted said that the decree attributed to saint peters first successor is probably apocryphal. is anything else attributed to pope linus? or was this the most important thing he did as pope? by all means mention that the liber pontificalis is said to contain that information. it was by oversight that i omitted the mention of the liber pontificalis though the fact that i have no way of checking that the liber pontificalis contains that statement probably hd some subconscious part in my forgetfulness.the question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to pope linus is aprocryphal. the letter of pope nicholas i is certainly genuine. i should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are i think less likely to go to mass wearing pants than without a veil and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil. if the pants question disappears from the footnote i will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article. by all means add the point that i regrettably forgot to mention that traditionalists do not like women in pants at mass.,0

4644,4644,dear wikinews wikipedia since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise and/or contribute. for example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia? this is a conflict of interest. another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including “blackpearl “svtcobra” “chris mann” and “whoville” own disney stock have gone to any disney theme park watch disney movies and/or buy disney products? then “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest. does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses? then this is a conflict of interest. what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” don’t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates? as documented volunteers including “blackpearl “svtcobra” and “whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards. thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.wikipedia and wikinews editors dont follow wikinews own written polices... “do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news. you even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion. you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue. wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it. incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims. are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well? they proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such. wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute. its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating. yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control. if you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more.. does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?,0

4714,4714,i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of töbel here it comes dear val who is also a mormon or a parrots aint surei found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. i think that the person concern storm rider is grown up enough to do so on its own. unless next time i am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. it could be interesting. if you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to dont know what to say. so do the wisest just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand. all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light. i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. as for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie what about you? are you val? or are you rama? or are you dgl there is a lot of nick name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name. they are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous. so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo i will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.so what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own? i had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and i dont feel to make it again or take another. following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees hahaha and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule? it is all a lie. how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? it isnt equality it is power struggle. it is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here. wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equalityha ha make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic. for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first. i speak languages english danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek of them fluently the others as pocket use. like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm. as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. in europe from age we choose between languages english german and spanish at age we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew. to languages are part of the compulsory pensum. i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in india. that was for learning,0

4725,4725, free software / open source in many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source. the best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. if you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term i have no objection. if the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. if the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license excluding the gnu gpl. its text explicitly uses the term free software then its ok to use that description. the purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case. unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis.if you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better. ,0

4727,4727, warning i am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious and i am asking you kindly to back off as i am starting to get annoyed. i am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. you pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the palm sunday article. if you would simply do some basic fact checking this could all be avoidedmy change to lacon il was sourced via grazulis and you obviously reverted because you saw my username and didnt even check or research the validity of my edit. i would bet money that if any other user made that edit you wouldnt have reverted it. if you have this idea that i make willynilly edits with no basis then you are mistaken. i dig through hours online resources old newspaper archives books and pdf documents to find my information. i take pride in providing valuable detailed and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. all i ask is for you to trust me a little more and actually read the sources and information provided. sharkguy,0

4744,4744,thanks for the speedy reply and the links. after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit perhaps in a table form that can be added too or removed as needed rather than a vague catch all description.for example after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldnt be done alone. aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. im not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didnt really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.,0

4779,4779, henrietta van laer says no. its not that having an agenda at all is a problem for wikipedia. wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda prosocialists liberals greens and gays determined to vilify and demonize conservatives. it is a completely biassed source. its articles on socalled leftwing parties are blatant whitewash while those on socalled rightwing parties are nothing but vilification most of it based on flimsy thirdhand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. instead of detailing their policies wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.pov in wikispeak = different pov to us the wikipolice. i also get the impression that wikipeople are pretty young. there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. how naive can you get? i dont know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average. naturally they are inclined to vote labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a rightwing taxcutting party. many of them earn two or three times the average wage and like the fat cats they get generous pensionpackages too. added to the votes of the millions of people who live longterm on state benefits this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honestjoe workers or lowpaid. but wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics with a poster of che guevara on the wall his hair streaming in the wind.,0

4802,4802,hi again dearyes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people.and about azerbaijanis are turks or not. despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk turks of west branchoghuzstarted to come but infact it is not important when they came here. the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani and not azeri which is an invented word by persians turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang. as same as turks of turkey. you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see. it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not turk you dont know who you are i know you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean. pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not. about aran as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era. we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep. and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan. aran was part of this big land. but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep. former aran as you called are of my race and we r same nation. you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks. you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves. if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language which does not exist ok lets think azerbaijanis r not turk so what they r? azeri? ok lets call them azeri what is the next step? you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian? or not speak azeri lang.? so what is azeri lang.? where is it? can you learn it to about million people? lets thing pragmatic as well as rational. even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of years ago nor persian.also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. one was paniranist other was panturkist. some of their researches looks really funnyabout the names of turkish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan. if you were here youll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name? ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan. most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian. my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats armenians and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays. they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc. which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk. i dont know what they want us to feel in tehranthe name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well. this word cant change to azarbaijan during history. i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it nowi had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well. the diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know. whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty,0

4832,4832,i think it is both a khmer character and a tamil character then. the problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly but that it did not represent the sound w like the other characters in the logo. the khmer character does not represent w either. talk according to wikipediawikipedia logosalphabets represented in the logo they do represent the letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the english w as in wikipedia.however according to nohat at user talknohat/archive trouble in all the logos only some of the symbols were selected to represent wikipedia— others were chosen at random. and threads at user talknohat/archive say the same thing. angela says the same thing in metatalkmain page/archives//error in the wikipedia globe. zocky repeats it at talkmain page/archive wrong devnagari symbol for wi in wikipedias logo. the only remaining tiny flaw i can see in your logo thue is the topright piece klingon r is lacking any depth there should be a black edge to the piece but instead we see the grey of the inside. not very important at all though. ah i and the person who reported the problem with the tamil/khmer character thought that all the characters should represent w. but that is obviously not the case. imo the klingon r is within stylistic freedom so i guess the logo is correct now. when at first you dont succeed redefine success . talk acousmatic hi there you suggested a merger but you did not start a discussion i think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. instead i would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to acousmatic sound so that the page can function as a subsecion of acousmatic music which is a particular form of electroacoustic music one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. the acousmatic sound article might focus more on schaefers and chions theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context. ,0

4869,4869,this article is being rewritten at jack abramoff/abramoffrefactor. please take note of the existing notes and outline and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. comments welcome. thanks archives archive friday th august talkjack abramoff/archive i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. copyviothis article and its sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia. theyre essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal. both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia. they need to be deleted immediately. alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio. tyco as below was edited the text was accurate but half the news story was pasted in here. you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story attribute a link and it not be a copywrite violation. its called plagerism. tyco almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article. ive removed part of it as it needs to be rewritten. i think ive cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up hopefully. there is alot of nonessential stuff in this article about peripheral people and not about abramoff however. it needs to be cleaned up more as the article meanders alot here and there. i reverted some things you took out outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about delay. that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted. it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it. just providing a link is not attribution and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism not fair use unless you are quoting. also if you are going to say the los angeles times reports you need to source the times not a secondary source i.e. democracy now.i modified the quote and attributed properly. the speech from tom delay is a direct quote its in quotations so of course it is taken wordforword from the source. ill tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. heres the primary source for the other thing. no problem. if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first and then rework it i dont usually just leave it out if the quote is accurate. btw have you found a link for the franken quote i cant find anything other than on blogs. honestly im not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is really anyway. the forced abortions part was originally reported by brian ross at abc news for / on march . it also appears in al frankens book the truth with jokes in the tom delay saipan sex tour and jack abramoff casino getaway chapter. since weve agreed that primary sources are key ive change the attribution in the article. the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed norquist etc pages to it.basically we need fewer facts and more context. at the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. i moved the whole scandal to its own page. this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players in particular ralph reed. i am not doing this to hide the scandal i think that people looking for info on i,0

4876,4876,shockedi am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an eb account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information. that opinion took a nosedive today when i came across this article in wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection. if i want to find out about bose headphones or any other product i will go to their web site i dont expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia. one can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader. the fact is i dont care whether this so called article is written from a npov or not whether its balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not i do care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if its a fact it somehow deserves a place here. i can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that i dont want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list.,0

4972,4972,with over college students studying abroad every year theres bound to be all kinds of tall tales urban legends and misinformation swirling around. while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.misconception studying abroad is very expensive.truth in most cases it is actually cheaper to study abroad. lets say the tuition at your school is $ per semester and room and board is another $. now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance books and laundry. you are now well over $ for the semester. well all but one of our programs in spain is under $ per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.tabmisconception i cant use my financial aid to study abroad.truth in almost all cases your federal aid stafford loans pell grants etc. can be used to study abroad and in some states you can use your state aid as well. it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money.truth the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program. the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had. if we were putting students in bad families in dangerous neighborhoods then no one would ever recommend us to their friends. since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year its a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. misconception ill be so busy with schoolwork that i wont get time to see the country im in.truth this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about + photos from a long list of countries. students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad.truth if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses then its true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad. if you plan ahead however and leave some electives open to you then you should be fine. the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.misconception most of the world hates americans so i wont be safe.truth theres no doubt that there are a lot of people who dont like the american government but that has nothing to do with the american people. if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european australian or asian countries you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous. there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe. go to the u.s. state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.studying abroad is a onceinalifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of. before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts. i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you youll be hopping the first flight abroad.one organization that help ensure that you have safest unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad. here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countriesstudy abroad spain academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona madrid salamanca and sevilla. study abroad england academic studies offers study abroad programs in london. study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence. study abroad france academic studies offer study abroad programs in aixenprovence and avignon. ,0

5049,5049,with all respect i dont know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around. i dont think this is the way to make people feel welcome on wikipedia. chussid should not make personal attacks but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history. any normal person in chussids position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed. indeed. and the reasons they give are totally outrageous. these same people do consider which also does not give any names or an address of the persons behind it a reliable source. because it fits in their zionist thinking pattern. jaz does not. if you ever wanted to know what jews who oppose zionism go through you are having a nice view of it right now. incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting. just because youre bothered about something does not give you the right to cross the boundaries of civility. a discussion can be heated and honest without being incivil and thats what we require here. ∇∆∇∆ ,0

5080,5080,lets stop and think about how the jimbo gif thing has gone since it started and maybe those of you who are voicing that im stubborn could rethink that as an unfair characterization a admin comes here tells me that he/she was going to review my block but now wont because the jimbo animation makes him/her nauseated and that i will never be taken seriously because its there. then the same admin states after my reply that its essentially my fault that he/she didnt review the block. think about how you would react to an attitude like that. now consider the statements made by those who are obviously better at communicating what they really mean its hard for me to read the page with it there. if that had been said in the first place how would you have reacted to that instead? i know that if that had been stated to me initially i would have understood because its a reasonable statement and observation and i dont want people to have problems reading the page and had no problem removing the jimbo gif from my page. snarkily saying that the jimbo gif makes one either annoyed or nauseated and will keep others from taking me seriously is neither helpful nor clear as to the real issue is it? ,0

5129,5129,i actually hadnt even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization audio that you both have proposed. i could make the issue a little more complicated though graphic equalizer not yet written smiley face curve parametric equalization and british eq all have to do with what ill call music equalization for lack of a better term. this includes sections and of the current equalization filter along with possible future articles tone controls loudness control combine with smiley face speaker equalization etc. oh im certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles but could as well be topics in one article except that a few of these already exist separately. the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer but has become the accepted term since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someones taste not strictly to compensate for a channels frequency response.then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization or some such term which would include section of equalization filter telecommunications lines riaa equalization fm pre/deemphasis as well as equalization of nonaudio channels this is the orginal meaning of equalization. such equalizers are generally nonadjustable by a user at least and transparent to the end user. so i call it a different subject even when it is audio. anyway i dont have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems. though id be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues. come to think of it i dont have to ask for permission ,0

5132,5132, the article is mostly about the pound in general with no mass/force distinction due its historical treatment as a weight. perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic pound article and pound mass should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system in this case the pound mass is a member of the fps gravitational system of units. there should be a link to the pound mass article from the pound article of course but it deserves no better treatment than the lb of the fps engineering system. there is a table of the fps systems at poundforce and at slug mass which tabulates various fps systems. its a little less clear than it used to be what was simply called fps engineering is now engineering absolute and the fps gravitational system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the engineering gravitational system which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to newtons nd law. where did the gravitational system come from? maybe some reliable sources are in order.,0

5134,5134,edits by keraunoshi keraunos. i see you added to and rearranged some of this article. i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. but actually that isnt physically accurate. the universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy. where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear i.e. the universes taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. hence i went ahead and cut this edit of yours.if people read further into the body of the article under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free. you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.i kept the ressurection link. i understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar. the term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means. you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to tipler will occur between x ^ and x ^ years from now in proper time.one should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of artificial intelligence ai as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate. hence im changing this to from that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term.i also removed your quote of tiplers estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his book the physics of immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on. so tiplers current estimation is different now. for more on that seef. j. tipler the structure of the world from pure numbers reports on progress in physics vol. no. april pp. . see also here. also released as feynmanweinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything arxiv. april . you added the section criticism from string theory.i kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. i changed the section title to implications from string theory since brian greene doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to tiplers omega point theory in greenes book that you referenced.this section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under wikipedias rule concerning original research. as its written its a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction. you moved the see also section to underneath the references. you also added a number of links therein.based upon wikipedias featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously before the references. hence i moved it back. i removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce,0

5136,5136, the less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is british irish isles. believe when i say that the manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the u.k. as a protected and supported territory republic of ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the u.k.did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the british isles. place names reflect current realities thus we have istanbul and not constantinople. a better example would be the aegean coast of turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the greek coast and all the islands were greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the turkish state has jurisdiction the only islands which are now greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of greece. if you were to rebut by saying that british refers to something more than a political term but rather than an ethnic or geographical one then the same argument or even a better one can be made of greek. the greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient greece e.g. southern italy sicily turkey armenia etc and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated greek are ethnically and linguistically greek but live in the state of turkey and therefore the islands and coast are turkish. thus you could not refer to the island of ireland as british.,0

5138,5138,title of article in english wikipedia this morning a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full vietnamese diacritics. i just moved it back to the version without diacritics for the following reasons this is the englishlanguage article about ngo and the great majority of english text written about ngo and other vietnamese generally do not include diacritics. in english in fact inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect at best or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard english orthography. please note i am by no means an englishlanguage bigot i am a student of the vietnamese language and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in vietnamese. however it is clear that in english the diacritics play no role in pronunciation. the wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in english is the form that should be used. apr utc,0

5140,5140,for the record larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that universal wasnt going to go anywhere with the galactica franchise. it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on universals part to do anything with commander cain and the pegasus and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis which was built by the th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth. the film would have dealt with the search a major battle with the cylons and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth all w/o involving the galactica or the rtf other than being mentioned.the first article google shows is this one . and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although im not sure about whether theres some wikirule about referencing other miniwikis. the john larocque article on the attempt is at . hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort but seeing as how their site has a lot of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware ill quote it here to save your systemsin the spring of it was announced that glen larson was making plans to bring galactica to the silver screen. impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander larson paired with its producer todd moyer on an estimated $ million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg. the story picked up where the series left off but followed the exploits of commander cain and the battlestar pegasus made famous in the original series episode the living legend guest starring the late lloyd bridges. in the concept commander cains search for the lost battlestar galactica leads him to contemporary earth which according to the story was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar atlantis.special effects were to be handled by moyers company no prisoners dfx utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander. moyer planned to update some of galacticas ships including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkersà la the transformerswhen on planet surfaces. moreover he and larson planned to expand the galactica franchise to include an imax film a theme ride and a new line of merchandise.then as quickly as it had been announced the project vanished from the radar screen. it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues. it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar galactica were still in some dispute. in either case the project disappeared into the ethers.iirc had a page on this at one time but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared. ,0

5148,5148,moncrief do you even know what a shepherd is? i used to work on a cattle ranch so i know a bit about this stuff. to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep usually in flocks in the fields... unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others. the s werent biblical times. shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that downandout laborers got when they could get it. in fact thats an important part of proulxs story characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. afterwards ennis worked with cattle and jack worked most of his life in an office job not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark. however the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer the summer that so defined them. therefore id say that the relevant description especially in this paragraph discussing that summer would be shepherds. that however is more up for debate. i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. although anybody whos ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that thats just a circumlocution for shepherd. but since i dont want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page ill settle for that as a compromise. chris ,0
5149,5149, wpfilm coordinator hey i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wpfilm concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. im a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. is it largely updating reviewing articles and aiding in the establishment of task forces at least as far as i can see? do coordinators generally specialize in various areas i.e. one handles task forces others reviewing or a combination of any such duties? if so i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status. if i was elected i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wpfilms scope and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort. that said i understand that im relatively new to the film project and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project. just curious as to your thoughts on the matter. cheers converse ,0

5160,5160,ive restored the page to the version thats stood for some months. to address the anons concerns the revert restoring the criticisms of prime ministerial power section repeated nearly word for word information already in role and authority. the revert restoring the list of canadian prime ministers section created a whole section for one link that duplicated one at the top of the qualifications and selection section. the revert restoring the salary and privileges sections split an earlier merge of the two for no apparent benefit. it also reinstated trivial and unsourced comparisons of the prime ministers salary to some of canadas top corporate executives note weasel words. the revert restoring the living former prime ministers reinstated trivial information better covered at list of prime ministers of canada the revert restoring the death of the prime minister reinstated a list of trivia and moved back there information that had been shifted to the privileges section.in all the reverts achieved little mostly decreasing the quality of the article. ħ ,0

5191,5191, the importance of khalifman...and of anand ponomariov kazimzhinov and topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for fide...cannot be overstated. they represent the rule of law the functioning of the world title cycle at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle as it had been from onward. to say that fischer kasparov or alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of khalifmans title reign. one could say that fischer kasparov and alkehine were stronger than euwe and smyslov too...but that doesnt get us anywhere. we dont rank us presidents by reputation we list them all equally yes? khalifman himself in in interviews said that although he was not the strongest player in the world being th by rating...he was clearly the world champion having won the title in the open public cycle run by fide. that stand that position is what makes his title reign important. btw before anyone denigrates the fide title champions ...it should be noted that at least two could be considered supergms anand and topalov and that one anand regained the title via the classical method. chesspride ... ,0

5194,5194,ekantik do you believe that sathya sai baba can miraculously transform his genitals? i would appreciate an answer.i also find it amusing that ekantik of all people is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by sai devotees when ekantik is a hare krishna congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord krishna literally manifested seperate human forms married seperate women copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. sanjay also believes that lord krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord vishnu a male transformed himself into a woman mohini devi. so it appears that ekantik and sai devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. i cant help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.funny how ekantik and andries critics of sathya sai baba want to promote well sourced stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference written by a doctor in a well known sri lankan newspaper is not well sourced. this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions. good luck wikisunn. you see what you are up against? talkemail ,0

5248,5248,well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wpdbad here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here i mean the talkinternational recognition of kosovo page. as far as the wprm if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure im still not sure that there is one. moreover im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed. persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wparbmac probation this article is under the scope of. concerning the closure of proposal. im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wprm. actually i find wprm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wprm but then i might misunderstood something. i might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter. hus as a formalist as i consider you at the moment i must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. i suppose i pointed out one might consider ive used irony i apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least. maybe some other place exists which im not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself. not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action ? / . sorry for that.ijanderson you asked why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia? well actually i do consider this title is biased also. but personally i consider the irok more globally important not just to me as one might think it is. if the bias is dealt with this issue irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also. and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place > maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea.all the best. s talk ,0

5252,5252, september utci love how i specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission. your line response was the equivalent of nananana booboo as far as i am concerned. lets dissect these lines.you dont understand propaganda.that is a loaded statement if i ever read one. i have read up on the term propaganda thanks very much and my readings are not simply limited to this website which i feel is narrow in its scope. i have been on a program that toured the death camps of poland and studied the use of propaganda in nazi germany. i am currently awaiting a response from a phd who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry and it is with respect to our point of contention here. funny i cant find any work you have done on this subject mr. jensen yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. i have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. you use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.i am not denouncing advertising for products i consider harmful and this is what you need to understand because i have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. this statement you have just made is a personal attack. additionally it is incorrect. i dont consider the product to be harmful. it is harmful. this is not an opinion but a restating of facts by the iarc/who and health organizations worldwide based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. if it were simply an opinion i can understand why you could be frustrated. but the irony mr. jensen is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer among other health risks please take the time i urge you to read any or all of the references i quoted in my submission all from established medical journals. the industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant says that uv exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed not proven whatsoever and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven e.g. cancer prevention base tan exaggerated and can be achieved through safer means e.g. vitamin d exposure. so please enlighten me mr jensen as to what propaganda is? is propaganda not a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?. thats the definition on the wiki page right? i am sure you have head of a systematic review that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. it is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. well thats what i use and thats what the world health organization used when they came to an unbiased conclusion that uv exposure from tanning beds as well as the sun is a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes. in my submission i think i clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points including the systematic reviews i mention. is this not the same as presenting one side of an argument to influence the attitude of the community? or is it that as you say i just dont understand propaganda? i have to say it yet again to you because i think this is such an important point that i have to drive home this is not my opinion. tanning beds cause more harm than good fact. tanning industry sites present the good which is partly true and negate the bad partly false and this is also a fact. if you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of good business its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product and the result is advertising that is propaganda. the industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics e.g. suggesting that cancer society and neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children blaming o,0

5264,5264,personally i think many of the disputes could be resolved if we had some consistency in what is and what isnt to be said about politicians and that is more than anything a structural issue with wikipedia that probably has also been dealt with extensively in other wikis concerning perhaps george bush. perhaps we can should be looking there for guidance as to how the community has dealt with the issue.basically what we have is one camp who wants to tar grant devine/brad wall with sourced and referenced bad stuff but goes and eliminates the sourced and referenced bad stuff written about lorne calvert and other figures in ndp administrations. and we have another camp that does the opposite and an edit war is the ultimate result.,0

5269,5269,i dont want to reopen the issue as the issue was never actually solved. wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic and childrens books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count. instead of just blind reverting changes id like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources. whenever a source is in question it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some peoples bias against editors who arent signed in. these changes were badly needed and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wpowns the article and others who violated wpagf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good. ,0

5326,5326, basic income dispute resolution i dont understand the finding futile or how to proceed to resolve the issue. regarding the wikipediabicyclesandwagons reference its my understanding that i am building a bicycle that may be slightly off spec and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec. i point out also that the basic income is listed as a priority by four wikigroups and so it is a pretty important bicycle. also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability imo but regardless of this opinion a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed. to keep the bicycles/wagons analogy the page was a high quality bicycle and an important bicycle to wikigroups. there is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away. ,0

5330,5330,=== page is in rough shape ===with the recent purge of content the page is not as informative as it once was. the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed. one editor may appear to hate since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog. also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog. meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content. for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work and the link to reciprocity is not online and the topic not a major issue. both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available.in order to be bold i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content including from sources that are not government funded. basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening. barring this broadened content eligibility we all need guidance for what is eligible content and perhaps what makes ineligible. the content there was written in and has been adopted whether independently or without attribution by other authorshere is the major recent deletion . specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced. some of these can be sourced elsewhere but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy dont spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do. basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients or find and punish abusers. basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions such as social security in the us is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation. balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work. better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up. smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction. viewed this way the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation. social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically with less requirement on charity and welfare. it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income. its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner. natural finances definition of social dividends variable basic income tax revenue surplus over social program expenses essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic productivity and automation growth. the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.,0

5346,5346,mexico a regional power? i dont agree that mexico is a regional power at least of latin america it could be a regional power of central america but nowadays it is considered to be part of north america.in the other areas of the world the article is divided between east west north south not between ethnic or languagegroups. if this was the case in europe it could be considered latin germanic slave and even anglosaxon groups.if we consider this in the americas case it should be south america and not latin america.second case mexico has a great gdp but in overal terms gdp is not the only factor we should consider military power projection and foreign policy. mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the usa argentina venezuela or colombia have greater military and power projection capabilities historically they have been much more interventionous and agressive toward other nations than mexico and today we can see the same specially in venezuela case. may personally i agree with you but you need sources to say it. this encyclopedia is not a place for orignal research. furthemore editors have produced sources saying mexico is a regional power of latin america if we change it to south america there would be no place in wich to put mexico. besides brazils influence is not restricted to south america it would not make sense to say it is restricted since the sources dont agree.,0

5372,5372, utcan interesting comment convict leasing isnt the same as slavery where theres ownership and title. however i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery...true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. one ended w/ the th amendment and the other was legalised under the th amendment not the corwin amendment of . in other words what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause? wwhat do you think they were referring to? futhermore i dont see a problem including this in the article so long as it is a small reference and not the focus of the article. as to scholarship there is reputable work on this and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business plantations mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. yes they were mostly black. the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery though not chattel. this was systematic and went on until ww though todays version is slightly different. now some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. slavery by another name by douglas blackmon who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic. thats the point. this is far from original research and there are other scholars whove written about it. now i havent edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here but id like to know the issue as it is now. how do other editors feel? one other thing american historians do not always agree on things and i have noticed at least one conspicious neoconfederate argument in the article unsourced though on a different part of the article. so yes its important to look at historians but on some topics theres a whole lot of rubbish particularly w/ slavery issues so a consensus by historians may never happen and sadly ideological agendas do exist and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources. id say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important. july,0

5409,5409,way i see it people who say the sherman is a very good tank are seriously overestimating it. i mean come on it was nicknamed ronson for a reason you know. any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. the only notable good sherman at the end of the war is the vc firefly but because us ordinance doubted the pounder could be fitted onto the tank it was manufactured in limited quantities. the only notable features of the sherman was that it was produced in large quantities had a mechanical reliability that beat the t and came with better secondary equipment such as fm radio and an elevation gyrostabiliser.not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. once a sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a tiger tank. the tiger shot at the building and the shell went right through and penetrated the shermans turret. there are also tales of german tanks who take out two aligned shermans in one shot. also do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull? those are efforts to help augment the armour of the sherman.,0

5422,5422,ok obiwan. youre starting to make me suspicious. what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions? own up. either way you did not answer my question directly and i also suspect you know it. does this mean that wpo is not useful to you? but you did answer it indirectly. so you get an even more direct question in return why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? for one you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. if you dont mind im going to take this straight to the source wpo peeps what the dealio? ive asked people on wp to put up or shut up. ive asked the wmf to walk their talk. in fact ive staked my rep several times now and im not done yet. now im asking you why dont you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? onwiki or off obiwan certainly isnt the first to question your selfrighteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia. i for one have been wondering for a while now. so lets see what you can do besides making snarky personal comments. heres a pot and heres a kettle. need i mention what color they are?onwards with obiwans points. i dont believe in nasty people. deciding anyone is bad nasty etc. has only one purpose one can feel better about being bad nasty etc. to people theyve so judged. i dont think this is particularly productive. in fact imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides or more often others have convinced them that they themselves are bad people. we could talk about this more in another thread but weve got to get back on topic here so. . . you know that the wikipediocrats are smart. you have spent more time there than youre willing to admit directly. i immediately wonder if its just in reading or in writing too. they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoningwise that ive met so far. but emotionally. . . less than average. how do you think many of these smart mer fers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? a lot of them fell from grace not because they werent an asset to the community but because they didnt seem to know when or they were completely unwilling to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. thats one part of the answer many of them are banned or blocked whether rightly so or not from editing on wikipedia. also its normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. youll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. frankly we could speculate about these peoples motives and methods til the sun goes down. lets be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here. what we as a wikipedia community cant do is ignore them away. and even if we could were doing a pisspoor job of it because i almost always hear about whats been said on wikipediocracy from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site. ultimately i go back to my old standard i dont give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are alls i know is that they are saying something interesting and i appreciate the fact that i dont have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it. obiwan no use playing coy. you know exactly what im talking about. d ,0

5440,5440,the ezekiel passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclopædidia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to yahweh along with jeremiah .. both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable. the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god. it is cited in encyclopædia britannica moloch with the comment note also the attitude of ezekiel in xx. seq. references which cannot be explained away. the article the international standard bible encyclopedia molech moloch treats it rather strangely remarkingthat this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live ezekiel given by god to his people by way of deception and judicial punishment as some hold is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.it is not clear what this means quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold. this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to yahweh. it also brings in bogus molochworship in connection to carthage. not a good article in any case.three different rabbinical interpretations of the ezekiel passage appear at . the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning disliked by trs but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. that would not be a reason to suppress rashis interpretation and the writer does not do so.there is a discussion at which covers in part john days treatment favorably but also discusses the ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the peoples belief and apparently ezekiels beliefs that commands which ezekiel saw as bad came from yahweh. note john day believes moloch is not yahweh but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.in short the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by yahweh. it has long been in general a problem pasage. but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response which seems to me weak. but add it with a citation if you will. but do not suppress.the inclusion is not editorializing by me. i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. the ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to yahweh and normally used as support for that argument indeed one of the main sources for that argument. my own pov as much as i have one is that the evidence is confused there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to yahweh. even when when that interpretation is rejected the ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.i dont believe that anything i have included in this article including the ezekiel passage is nonstandard for discussion of moloch. i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. one obviously cannot agree with all sides. moloch cannot easily be at once yahweh an entirely different god the name of a kind of sacrifice. passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. please let the normal statements used as arguments stand regardless of the positions.i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound,0

5504,5504,it seems to be one of the old info from the times when in wikipedia the need for sourcing them was not so pressing simply remaining unquestioned until now. i dont know any external source that would present how the roma have significant cultural similarities with the cultural features that the balinese borrowed from the subcontinent. because of this and because it may be misleading lacking the presentation of the common cultural features with the indians personally i have in mind to add them when ill have available time i consider it would be appropriate to delete this statement.,0

5518,5518,so what if konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers? thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category. dualpane behaviour is part of konquerors functionality not its whole functionality. you can play textmode tetris from within emacs. would you categorize emacs as a tetris clone?as for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management à la classic macintosh finder. they certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches. so it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there. besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software. but again youre missing the point as ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is usage of the term in qualified circles. ,0

5520,5520,if the nazis meant reich as empire they could have made that clear by translating it that way in englishlanguage material they produced. they did not do so. they always used reich in english translations. for one of many examples see this page it is the official german government translation of a hitler speech. note that reich is always reich. the nazis did not consider frederick the great as having anything to do with the first reich. they did view him as a great german. the problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be a very accurate translation. wikipedia does not depend on what editors think it depends on what they can support with reliable sources. you have yet to provide a single reliable source that supports your point. i and others have provided quite a few supporting the opposite. ,0
5521,5521,thats your pov last time i saw the general assembly of the united nations there was an ambassador representing a former yugoslav republic of macedonia. also an entity describing itself as the former yugoslav republic of macedonia recently applied to join the eu. this countrys self identifying name obviously varies according to the circumstances. it has two official names out of which one fyrom ranks higher in a google search see above. this is a legitimate term and is not a breach of npov its not possible npov is not based on names but on presentation of the facts using either name the article is capable of being neutral as long as what is actually going on is told in an unbiased way.,0
5522,5522,blackpearll calls herself evidently mrs. johnny depp and pirate lordess and such. she celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia. why would someone devote so much time to / check the site and on these pages? has her judgement become impaired? her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear. that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral. sorry if your feelings are hurt but if one purchases products such as pirates of the caribbean posters toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.,0

5559,5559, sorry that you feel this way malangali. i dont suppose that i can persuade you but i did try and do my homework. iringa is not offically designated a city at present unlike mwanza dar and arusha you asserted this in the article but it is simply factually incorrect. a seperate question is whether iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the tz governments definition. ok. first i assure you that urban can imply either town or city particularly when contrasted with rural see urban area. i checked two english language travel guides for tanzania both of whom use town. moreover i contacted some tanzanians in iringa who agreed that it was town rather than a city not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in wikipedia just to try and convince you that the town thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint or whatever it is youve decided i am doing. i dont believe in individual ownership of wikipedia articles. however city is not the best word here and its entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. again i regret clashing with you on this and im very happy to discuss and change my mind on things and im glad youve improved this article but im afraid i will not simply agree with whatever you say just because im english and you i presume are a tanzanian. ,0

5575,5575,also depending on the article you will look at the socioeconomic equality reason will vary.the violence was undoubtedly racial. its prime targets were the chinese merchants who have flocked to tibet by road and on a prestigious new train across the roof of the world. the mobs were the losers of lhasa – the poor who seethe with resentment outwitted commercially by chinese traders outgunned by the chinese army and many fear ultimately to be outnumbered by chinese migrants.now this is straight from the horses mouth. the actual western journalist who was there wrote this not some msm that decided to twist the sources words. i thought it was the most npov and fair way to just say they were angry about socioeconomic inequality inflation and fear of becoming a minority in their own city. why is that wrong? its the most concise fair and npov way to state what they were angry about which caused the rioting.,0

5625,5625,as posted at regarding a suggested wikipedia regrets the errors regarding the according to format for information cited regarding mediation. this most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why i requested this user be blocked. in addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the nccc article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder. you can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless. ill renew my call for a permanent user and ip range block. loverofart coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature. administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and i assure you that they are out of the norm for the project. i encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation. if you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken. philippe talk ugly personal attacks you approve??good morning philippe. the post above yours by loverofart is typical of his posts in my direction. an ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the national civilian community corps by posting false and misleading information at the wikipedia website.if your / wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that i enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with him/her while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. a responsible adult a real editor should have interceded long ago.he/she and the others working over the nccc text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase according to does not belong at wikipedia. as i read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me. it would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case.i appreciate wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. i am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the wikipedia site. your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.a pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues i raise or the attacks on me.pull loverofart out of this situation and i will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the nccc site. i refuse to have further dealings with him/ ,0

5627,5627,hi i just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. i think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. also none of the information under applications is cited. if this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. under references reference list is misspelled. also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. if you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. the analogies in the hologram and holonomy under theory overview was very helpful to understand the concept. ,0

5643,5643, ettlinger being jewish + his family hi alli learned about adrian’s death after a web search yielded this wikipedia article see my post of in memoriam about him to the freecell solving discussions mailing list and since he was a good internet friend of mine and we corresponded extensively on email i’d like to help with the english wikipedia article about him. in any case ettlinger told me in a private email that he was jewish at least by descent he wasn’t an observant/religious jew and said something about being a deist and so i think his article should be added to the american jews by occupation category. one problem i see there is that i dont see any subcategory for jewish american engineers and/or jewish american software developers he was both. i know that richard stallman is a jewish also only by decent american software developer and he belongs to the categories american computer programmers and american jews and there are naturally many others. i have kept most of the emails with him so can upload them in part to my website or elsewhere for citation nut will it be considered a selfreference? so what should be done?adrian also told me about his family two children if i remember correctly and four or five grandchildren all but one are attending university now but i dont think he mentioned any names. should they be mentioned as well?ill try to improve the entry about him in other respects. thanks to all the wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research. ,0

5650,5650,editing edits on wiki improve by evolution only the best survives. they become best by change after change after change. i find i make two kinds of edits. ones which add content and ones which improve language. i fancy i am quite good at writing smooth prose but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. if i have a fact to insert or point to make the primary thing is to make or insert it. then someone else can smooth it along or i may do so myself when i have more time or after leaving the piece and rereading it. it can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go because you do not spot your mistakes. as to our last exchange in severus snape yes i agree i put in a clumsy statement but i was trying to express a particular point. you improved the flow but slightly altered my point. i changed it again back a little to my original intention though you also added something. cheers.,0

5675,5675,this is such a fun entry. devotchkai once had a coworker from korea and not only couldnt she tell the difference between usaenglish and british english she had trouble telling the difference between different european languages. kind of keeps things in perspective eh? not suprising. while i can easily tell the difference between french german italian spanish dutch etc. put me in a room with a chinese japanese korean vietnamese and a thai speaker and i probably couldnt tell the difference. if i saw it written id probably have somewhat more luck though. sjkvietnamese has more syllablefinal consonants than japanese i think you can tell them apart that way maybe. is this right? juuitchansomeone suggested heath robinson and rube goldberg as a vocabulary difference. its certainly an interesting parallel but i dont think it really belongs here. they were both artists with their own style and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested. at any rate they cant quite be considered translations because as an adjective rube goldberg is more specific describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions heath robinson in contrast is more surrealistic or fantasyoriented. ldcas an american i would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt a flat is an apartment and rubbish certainly is trash. granted i agree that a fag is not a cigarette and underground is not a subway. i may do some actual research and come back and fiddle with that list. eean.i think americans certainly understand the use of bum for butt rubbish for trash and to a lesser degree flat for apartment. but we dont use those terms much. point to a container for discarded things and an american will say thats a trash can a brit will say thats a rubbish bin. americans are more likely to use rubbish in the sense of bullshit. ldci deleted the following pair limited ltd and incorporated since they actually mean different things. incorporated means a corporation limited means a limited liability corporation you can also have unlimited liability corporations and no liability corporations. british and australian also ltd is roughly equivalent to american llc. sjki would say torch was much more common than pocket lamp which sounds quite oldfashioned. flashlight would be more easily recognised than the latter.yes id call it a torch and it would probably be labeled as a flashlight in its manufacturers packaging. imo torch is colloquial british english the anomeoh so flashlight is correct british usage? my dictionary said am. and the oxford english dictionary carried flashlight only in the meaning of photography. then ill remove the entry again. axelboldt,0

5679,5679,the fact that azeris are mixed turkic speaking people that sprung from the turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear. they were and are in the location that was arran that consistent of albanians and iranian tribes. furthermore the fact that the entire area was called arran then for some reason was renamed azerbaijan is another indication that azeris were not a turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the caucus next to the sakas. no one said azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other iranians in fact iranians are a multiethnic multi lingual group much like the kurds in the west have a different language/customs as do balochies in the south. what happened to iranians in arran intermittingly in which the turks invaded their tribes and the albanians were driven out and imposed their language on them via elite dominance does not change their original ancestry. you have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the azeris came from why they even appear/are part of iran even today and why these ethnic groups even have a persian culture? in all you can concentrate on their differences but fail to explain where did azeris come from? it is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts and write pages of texts about germanic peoples in an article about iranian peoples. i think i’ll stop at that.,0

5770,5770,criticism > the oohashi et al. results reveal some interesting contradictions. while full bandwidth sound was preferred to cd limited bandwidth over a speaker the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. additionally the preference for hfc was not replicated when using headphones only with speaker presentation ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. these are not contradictions. they are an essential feature of the study specified and discussed in the paper. there is no contradiction here. out it goes. contrary evidence and abx tests oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. abx tests only tell what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. if same research methods had been used and results were drastically different that should be called contradictory. i will state that even more generally than previous there are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to but nevertheless they affect humans wellbeing and happiness. for example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. we just dont know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. some signals could be processed half consciously in humans brains one feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.,0

5809,5809,romanization for words of english originon the mosjp talk page a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of english origin such as fainaru fantajī in for the sake of simplicity i called this case words of english origin more information on semantics here.over the course of a month it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. therefore a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. one suggestion on a compromise has been given already but it has not found unanimous agreement so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.one universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus and you were one of those selected in the process.what this invitation is you should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.what this invitation is not this is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations. this is not a vote on compromises either.it would be highly appreciated if you came over to the mosjp talk page and helped find a solution. thank you in advance. ,0

5818,5818,wikipediarequestsforcomment/historyandgeographythe following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. i trust that philip gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute. rossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam. these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed. one external link links to an article about the th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood. another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. it seems to me that this philip gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for rfa is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam. id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr. gronowski. i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. thank you very much for your consideration. ,0

5866,5866,i have removed the china section if in the future someone comes up with several reliable sources that state that certain events that happened in china from whatever period was a genocide then it should be included on this page but currently in my opinion there has not been enough scholarly sources presented to justify its inclusion. it is better to have no information about a subject in an encyclopaedia wrong information. i can not emphasize this enough. there seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative i heard it somewhere pseudo information is to be tagged with a needs a cite tag. wrong. it should be removed aggressively unless it can be sourced. this is true of all information but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons. –jimmy wales see wpproveit ,0

5871,5871,well lets try again one more time.re commonsenual = wpor. regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation glantz et al. commonsensual is not or. occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete and it is regulated by various international conventions. for instance guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation and one of them refers to something quite unique. therefore we can speak about the occupation sensu stricto and occupation following an armistice. that is what i mean under commonsensual occupation and that is how a reader will understand it.re belligerent occupation i do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way however other sources majority of sources use different terminology. therefore the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. i propose to present both viewpoints you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. therefore it is your arguments that do not hold water.re malksoo please reread his works again. and since both you and i can draw different conclusions from different pieces of malksoos text below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position made specifically for us the baltic sattes were occupied in june and annexed incorporated by the ussr in august . thus both occupation and annexation did happen. the fact of annexation and that the ussr proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own not occupied changed the nature of the occupation if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. for example when moscow olympic games took place the olympic regatta took place in tallinn. this cannot be a typical occupation it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant western opinion and post restored baltic states themselves the soviet annexation remained illegal. in this sense illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudodebate. the annexation since it remained illegal did not create any extra rights to the annexing power the ussr. if the article makes that aspect clear i would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to occupation and annexation of the baltic states. in fact i would recommend such change because it takes more precisely closer to the facts into account the complex nature of the soviet rule in the baltic states.what else do you need? malksoo clearly says that in the case of the baltic states both occupation and annexation took place and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense but not in others. p.s. llegal annexation equals extended occupation. in other words we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the baltic states and i never argued against that. again what synthesis you accuse me in?re there is no bridge between the baltic and soviet/official russian positions there is no inbetween or continuum of scholarship its one or the other wrong. there is a baltic position position of different foreign states which was different from state to state and from time to time positions of scholars western baltic russian soviet positions different during ss and during perestroika and official russian position.re from glantz to malksoo a belligerent occupation. glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the wwii not in the legal aspects malskoo does not consider soviet intervention in as a military operation at all. the only aggressive step according to him was a naval blockade.re baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were colonized probably. however other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the ussr hence extensive influx of migrants. was it possible if they had a colonial status?i expect you to treat my arguments seriously. ,0

5888,5888,it should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including muay thaiwhich mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper bodyboxing as it is calledand many other martial art techniques not exclusive to maui boran or maui tha etc... women are not considered true martial artists anyway. that is because the arts are designed used mastered and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. a womans training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. this is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. it is sad what has happened to karate and tkd in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practionersby way of parents unconditioned elders and women. but that is another debate. regardless female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. like it or not gender is of the physical mental and in my opinion the spiritual as well. play to its strengths not its weaknesses. it is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.,0

5892,5892, please remain civil. you may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article. you keep conflating my changes with those of someone else. the use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and i didnt make that change. you keep reverting all changes wholesale including changes made for reasons purely of style rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you. we have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that bradley manning is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action. you complain about blp but accepting claims about bradley mannings guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious blp policy violation. until the claims of lamo and the us government have been established in a court of law we cannot use the wordofgod to state their claims are true. as for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted. we are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted who clearly states that mannings treatment amounts to torture. ,0

5897,5897,i understand your point. i simply do not believe it to be valid. during the period in question the rc church did not have large armies at its disposal. it relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. in france louis a loyal catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. the rc church at this time were also opposed to this principle one that has become so widely accepted in western societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before. louis with the tactic support of leading churchman ordered acts of antiprotestant terror. lets be completely honest without the tactic approval of the church would a devout catholic have been committed to such a course of action? some leading churchman celebrated the outcome a france almost completely cleansed of protestants. now in all the material the criticism of the rc church is so obviously implied that this shouldnt need reemphasising. a modern historian would not write the following is a criticism of the rc church... that is how junior school children begin their english composition answers ,0

5918,5918,{{unblock i am appealing a hour block that was placed on me before i could post my response via the administrators message board. i apologize in advance for the length of this but i believe that its necessary to include all of these details. i wrote a summary at the end so that administrators could get an overview if they dont have time to read the whole statement.i will be addressing the claim that i violated the rr rule in the second paragraph of this article according to wpblp biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subjects privacy... in a book written in a foreign language with a lot of jargon there are often competing translations/interpretations. and a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes misquotes dubious translation and outofcontext statements. as per wpblp i think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used and for the same reason the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.with than in mind on the th of february i improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with wpblp based on this source.userzero responded to one of my edits by stating that i cant read. and in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a wikipedia administrator told me in as many words to get off wikipedia.take a break i didnt take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which i was told by said individual that i had behavioral problems.said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics i started to write a complaint against you why do i need to know that? he can let me know when he posts it and then later responding to another edit he didnt like by saying that it was on my charge sheet.now the reason i am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the rr issueafter posting my version of the paragraph userzero subsequently changed it to this.i will post only the first few words of his statement and the sourcesource there is a reason to kill babies on the enemy sideuserzero babies on the enemy side may be killed .after those first few words userzero continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. now at best this is a serious distortion. and when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing sometimes contradictory sources rationales theories proposals and ideas many of which are subsequently discounted limited in scope or just tossed by the wayside the disparity the statement may be done and there is a reason is even greater.aside from the distortion mentioned above in contradiction to wpblp userzero also opted for a particularly liberal outofcontext translation.why did userzero replace my edit with his own. his statementprefer source with an actual quotationas i showed above he didnt use an actual quotation.furthermore after seeing his comment i searched but wasnt able to find any wikipedia reference to a such a preference leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own wpjustdontlikeit on me without explanation. his actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multipronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in i.e. encouraging me take a break.newlin,0

5951,5951,but coincidence is. read the article i referenced by salmon he explains it very clearly it is accessibly on the internet. and by the way i am still waiting for those page references from nibley for the matches that you say are suppressed. if you cant give a reference then how do i know you are not exaggerating the parallels nibley claims or even making them up? this whole debate goes away when you can give us the references required to establish the facts. quotes and page numbers so we can cross check selective deletion das i dont appreciate how you are selectively removing my words from the conversations i have posted on this page it appears that you are deliberately trying to cast me in a bad light. if you are not comfortable with me posting here then we can move the discussion to my talk page. i never delete any posts there and the entire conversation can be preserved. once again you are trying to misconstrue my arguments by selectively deleting my posts here. i reverted them if you want to remove the conversation then remove the whole thing please.,0

5955,5955,new louisville definitionsince the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government. first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. if this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left. second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. third even if suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says. the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city. your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. what you are referring to is the louisvillejefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisvillejefferson county. both are defined separately by the census bureau see here. this article is about the consolidated louisvillejefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated. the confusion lies in the census bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures. although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings. the census bureau has accepted the louisville/ jefferson balance but not the city/county consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses. because of the acceptence of the lou/jef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.your assertion is not entirely correct. the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisvillejefferson county in their estimates. they also include a separate figure for the balance louisville/jefferson countykentuckya louisville/jefferson county balancekentuckyathats from the estimates the last number is the estimated population. this article is not about the balance however. issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page. actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is and not anywhere near . what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed? i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio. we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as or so when the census lists the population as . i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same. however that cannot be done here. an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed. there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article. please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation. since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — userstevietheman,0

5961,5961,replied talk please note that i did restore the revisions to talk rockerhi i couldnt help but notice that you have deleted several of my contributions that i worked very hard to create including several brand new pages that i had just made. yes i know these pages were short and lacked content but you must know it takes time to write a long and informative page on wikipedia. im just trying to contribute and i dont know why im having such a hard time doing it. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs im not sure that edits such as this back up your claim of just trying to contribute and neither do the three articles which you created this afternoon which were as you know were just made up nonsense example if plato was a christian this is what his philosophy would be called. qed. talk 飞天号航天服 飞天 deletion hi you deleted 飞天号航天服 飞天i think these qualify under since they are the original language names for the article in question feitian space suit so are indeed likely search terms. if someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name shouldnt they be able to reach the correct article? ... you used csd reason r recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers. however redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful as are redirects in other languages.this says redirects in other languages are generally useful ... hi there this is a difficult one i can see both sides of the coin. ive tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through categoryredirects from alternative languages but im still not sure. i have always read the redirect from another language as being more related to things such as kyiv topical one that one read the talk page but i digress or das wohltemperirte clavier rather than a literal transalation of every articles name in to other languages particulary those with nonlatin character sets. this is why i feel that the two mandarin? words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the english language wikipedia. but the bottom line is that i am one admin one opinion which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable. the redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. if they are renominated for deletion i will recuse myself from the process and well see what others think. sound ok to you? kind regards talk well theres the essay wikipediaredirects for discussion/redirects from foreign languages . the articles name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. ie. its a chinese spacesuit the actual name is in chinese not english. from the bit about nonlatin characters doesnt that indicate bias since english is used in hong kong as an official language where chinese characters are prevalent or india where nonlatin script is common and english is widely used. but we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type,0
5962,5962,the pira campaign that we are talking about started in a few years before bloody sunday so you can hardly say it started the whole affair in motion actually i think the whole affair was started in motion hundreds of years ago... anyway this article is not about the british army its about the pira so we need to stick to their contribution to the death / injury count. and as ive said elsewhere the pira have achieved very little else in the past odd years than kill and maim a lot of people. in ever repects by their own published aims they have failed. so although we do need to agree upon accurate figures along with the sources to back them up the information must appear in the lead for this article.,0
