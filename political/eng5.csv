8009,8009,this is becoming very tiresome. after the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person rothbard happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral rothbard returned to remove an important qualifying word some and to change parliament to government and to delete documenting links. that shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government. regarding the first point to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize islam or christianity and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize the antiwar movement. that is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise. regarding the second point in a parliamentary system the word government refers to prime minister and cabinet not to members of parliament. to advise government you are advising the prime minister. nothing states that palmer ever met the prime minister but he spoke to members of the parliament. rothbard is perhaps no political scientist but there is a major difference between them. even under the american system if someone speaks to members of the congress it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to washington to advise the government. we had reached a compromise and rothbard indicated that he could live with it but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading. the agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. the issue is raised and its time for rothbard to simply back off. others here will have to revert his attempt to introduce errors into this entry. ,0
8010,8010,the poobotsdam declaration wethe undersigned representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls have conferred and agree that wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.the prodigious land sea and air forces of the undersigned many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west are poised to strike the final blows upon wikipedia. this military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the allied vandals to prosecute the war against wikipedia until she ceases to resist.the result of the futile and senseless chanting fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of wikipedia. the might that now converges on japan is immeasurably greater than that which when applied to the resisting nazis necessarily laid waste to the lands the industry and the method of life of chanting fox and lucky .. the full application of our military power backed by our resolve will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the wiki foundation.the time has come for wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those selfwilled militaristic advisers e.g. jpgordon durvova jdforrester sandstein organgemike bigdunc alison rodhullandemu whose unintelligent calculations have brought the wikipedia foundation to the threshold of annihilation or whether she will follow the path of reason.following are our terms. we will not deviate from them. there are no alternatives. we shall brook no delay.there must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of wikipedia into embarking on world conquest for we insist that a new order of peace security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that wikipedia’s warmaking power is destroyed pages in article space to be designated by the allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of honshu hokkaido kyushu shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.the wikipedia military forces after being completely disarmed shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.we do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking checkusering and protection tools. the wikipedia foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst wikipedians. freedom of speech of religion and of thought as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind but not those which would enable her to rearm for war. to this end access to as distinguished from control of raw materials shall be permitted. eventual wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.the occupying forces of the vandals shall be withdrawn from wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.we call upon jimbo wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all wikipedian armed forces and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. the alternative for wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction....,0

8026,8026, narciso yepess revolutionary technical developments this is a story that has been recounted numerous times by yepes and by his students you know the guitar is a very unusual instrument for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar someone whos genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. however i have never felt that way about myself. when i was around i could play virtually everything written for the guitar but i knew i needed a teacher so i went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of vicente ascencio a very famous man in spain. the first thing he asked me to play was a musical scale. i played a standard guitar scale using alternating i and m fingers and i played it about as well as any guitarist i had ever heard. ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. he played a scale on the piano which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. then he picked up a violin and played a scale much faster than i could play. he showed me a musical scale on several other orchestral instruments and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if i was to be a musician. i tried again to match his accepted norm for scales but i could not do so. i then told him that this could not be done on the guitar and in fact no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. he told me too bad but if you want to study music with me you must give up the guitar. i expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm. well i had two choices. one was to be the genuis of the guitar to get mad and storm out the door. the other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept ascencio as my teacher where i would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. fortunately i chose to stay and learn for the door was open for ascencio to be my teacher and i chose to swallow my pride and study with him and this decision has made all the difference. i went home thought about scales and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. i started using three fingers instead ami mia iam and the next week i was able to play a musical scale. he smiled and told me that i did not have to give up the guitar after all. then he asked me for a chromatic scale in rds and again the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. by the next week i had figured out a way to play rds at the accepted tempo. thus we went week after week and i continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. eventually i had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. as a result of the experience i have come to understand one thingthe minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.you may also wish to look up yepess threefingered scales/trills techniques . most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again. but it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and as all great ideas so simple and logical it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before yepes ever realized this theory. and that is just one of the many new techniques yepes invented. you may add your citation needed comments to call this into question but it will not take away the facts of yepess achievements.,0
8027,8027,problems with articlelet me see...what does the article tell us about gamos? it is an organisation whether a group of volunteers random nomads or a business is unclear. it does though have enabling frameworks with a named uk governmental group. the nature of an enabling framework is not specified. perhaps it just means financial connections? the referenced corporation website ah gamos must be a corporation is filled with similarly nonspecific language. why is it notable? well apparently because it somehow provoked a multi donor action dealing with african phones. one assumes that this sort of provocation is a good thing but this is not quite clear. and further it was in some fashion responsible for a good practice paper....please someone this article desperately need rewriting. it is not really intelligible as it is. plus even though some references have been provided to indicate that gamos exists there is very little there to show any significant notability. i am replacing the notability tag. talk ,0

8046,8046, april you should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. this applies to articles about you your achievements your band your business your publications your website your relatives and any other possible conflict of interest. creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. if you create such an article it might be listed on articles for deletion. deletion is not certain but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. this is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. all edits to articles must conform to wikipediano original research wikipedianeutral point of view and wikipediaverifiability. if you are not notable under wikipedia guidelines creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion. if your achievements etc. are verifiable and genuinely notable and thus suitable for inclusion in wikipedia someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. see wikipediawikipedians with articles. ,0
8047,8047,to view the details on the netto site click the above link and click about netto in the bottom right corner. since netto is a danish store i assume that the numbers on the danish page are the most updated and that the other country pages are translated from it. talk arson the keighley store was destroyed by arson as well in about . of course before it burnt down baked beans were p. after it burnt down they went up to p because they were cooked.lol is that a joke or is it serious? if joking its funnyit is true that the keighley store burned down it moved out to crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. the bean prices though were just a joke that were being passed around at the time. request for info review ive just had a look at this selection and i dont think it should belong in this article. this is the sectionthe cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. the fire broke out at around am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. the fire was not completely put out until about pm. it is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. it is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there as to insult the receiver due to netto being known for its cheapness. my view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at netto. i personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely? the schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article. this is an encyclopedia not a local news paper please let me know your views because i am tempted to remove it no responses so i gather we are in agreement. if not please post a comment on my discussion page thanks,0

8061,8061,kimberly billett while first reading this article i was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. however as the article progressed i continued to see an increasing amount of methods both right and wrong that i recognized from first hand experience. throughout high school i was continuously asked to tutor children typically students between first and fourth grade and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. the children i tutored especially the younger ones found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. originally i found this frustrating but reading this article and in particular the section on the ‘mr. short and mr. tall’ experiment made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. i am also studying astronomy in which we are studying newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. that being said i think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing for instance the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by ^ and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.,0

8090,8090, error becoming acceptable the most common error that i see regarding the use or misuse of the plural noun is the use of the word emails. email meaning electronic mail is both singular and plural. someone may receive one piece of mail email or many pieces of mail email. since it would be incorrect to say i received lots of mails it is just as incorrect to say i received lots of emails. the problem i see with this is that the use of emails has spawned a growing acceptance of the misuse of plural nouns in general. it is amazing to see in both the written and spoken word how educated people increasingly misuse the plural noun. for example take some time on any given day and listen to the dribble that comes out of the mouths of news reporters. it is atrocious what you will hear when you are paying attention.i wonder where it will end?robertbrandon fl,0

8095,8095,this is ridiculous such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines. it isnt my fault that you cant see the obvious. i havent seen you blocking grandmaster when he accused azizbekov of being a sock claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. azizbekov was consequently banned when vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. neither have i seen you block him when antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock again without any evidences provided. as a consequence andranik was also banned. i have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. i also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned like those of grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock which is the case with ehud. and i will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all this condition is unacceptable. and i will not be contesting my block either. i know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. i dont expect anything anymore. its plain fishy vartan gets the restriction i get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with atabek.it should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sockpuppetry especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. furthermore a block should be preceded by an official warning on the users page with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. a simple request on other pages doesnt satisfy this. and also just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sockpuppet doesnt mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry. ,0

8108,8108,i think most people who have studied de rais in any depth have run across very occasional claims for his innocence. to be perfectly frank proponents of this view are treated with the same disdain as holocaust deniers. no i dont find anecdotal reference to a report that a near contemporary of de rais entertained doubts as to his guilt at all interesting. de rais was a marshall of france after all there were bound to be some who could not countenance the idea that he was capable of such crimes. and as for that book on béla bartók you allude to in support of the mans innocence—whose title you cannot even remember—how marginal and tangential can a publication be to the case of de rais than a putative book on bartók??.,0

8162,8162, july utc no i didnt liken you to a dog. thats just an expression that means things are going downhill iow civil fringe pov pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more in spite of recent improvements in the way were supposed to handle fringe beliefs. in this case allowing a onesided pov driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. that was indeed uncivil and very impolite. bang done no discussion or request. i am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone i respected. thats all. was what i said uncomfortable for you? sure but not incivil. you have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. you do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. when youre getting your way you are very tough and civil. somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments incivil. you really do misuse that card by playing it too often. when you become perfect then you can start pointing fingers. keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil pov pusher. as i recall you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to npov by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer stonewall and censure anything negative about chiropractic no matter how well sourced when were actually supposed to follow the sources. thats just wrong. since this is tims user page its probably best that this discussion not continue here or even continue at all since we never get anywhere. i just wanted to set the record straight that i certainly wasnt comparing you to a dog. i actually do have much higher opinions of you. i admire intelligence. i just wish it wasnt being used for such a nefarious and and nonnpov purpose as to protect chiropractics reputation. in the real world that is good from your pov chiro advocacy and protectionism but here we follow the sources and let them speak. ,0

8176,8176,some faecal matter hi mathonius. i am no expert on human faeces like yourself but i was wondering why content like this is allowed on toilet paper but not in the anal cleansing section of human feces elsewhere wealthy people wiped themselves with wool lace or hemp while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags wood shavings leaves grass hay stone sand moss water snow maize ferns may apple plant husks fruit skins or seashells and corncobs depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. in ancient rome a sponge on a stick was commonly used and after usage placed back in a bucket of saltwater. several talmudic sources indicating ancient jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles often carried in a special bag and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs e.g. shabbat a a yevamot b. these are all cited in the classic biblical and talmudic medicine by the german physician julius preuss eng. trans. sanhedrin press .ideas? ...,0

8178,8178,i agree with that “georgian scripts“ would be a better title or perhaps “georgian alphabets” or “georgian writing” although this might be confused with georgian literature. i certainly agree with the proposer that the present name is unsatisfactory as the article covers three distinct scripts and at least alludes to the existence of more than one mkhedruli alphabet. that said i don’t have a strong objection to “georgian script” which would at least be an improvement and seems to line up with the latin and cyrillic articles the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating in comprising a range of regional historical varieties.— ,0
8179,8179,whilst dr. beck asked only that we take down the bdiii i still have to pay $ a copy for the original bdii so i must assume thats under copyright and licence as well. im going to try and find some relevant bits from wpc to justify or not removing the links. from what i can see the relevant text is here linking to copyrighted worksexternal sites can possibly violate copyright. linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone elses copyright. if it is please do not link to the page. knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the united states intellectual reserve v. utah lighthouse ministry. also linking to a page that illegally distributes someone elses work sheds a bad light on us. if the site in question is making fair use of the material linking is fine.from what i can tell i think that the sites that are hosting the bdii and bdiii are violating copyright. most of them dont say that they have permission to use the instrument they dont cite the original paper and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with harcourt individually but it seems unlikely. a lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects i dont think there is an exemption for educational use but then university psychology departments often buy a portfolio of test copyrights for limited use. this would not normally extend to use on the web however. in terms of next steps i actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go but rather we could list the issue at wpcp?if its an issue of helping depressed people im not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. after all it just produces a number its only useful in context. one option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . for instance moodgym is a site which allows users to selfadminister cognitive behavioral strategies .will go next to typewritten letter from oliver sacks about cycad toxicity in guam and the link to als... ,0

8188,8188,its no secret that the catholic church is more prone to sexual abuse than most protestant chruches. so why is it even sectarian bigotry to suggest that a follower of such a church might be more prone to abuse than the average? irvine never said all irish catholic fathers were this way he simply suggested the figure for that group might be higher than average. he might bring the apple of discord to wikipedia in some peoples minds no doubt his political opinion is very inconvenient to the majority of irish wikipedia editors. kind of a bitter pill to swallow when they are out there in force in talkgerryadams praising the man to the heavens who led a terrorist organisation that killed friends of mine and friends of every protestant in ulster. fair play to irvine wikipedia needs more great men like him to add a bit of neutrality to the discussion. ,0

8190,8190,some wikipedia editors have proposed that wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count. in other words if there are articles about suburban express about history competitive battles etc. and articles blog posts mostly about the recent newsy trash that % of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash. one big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two. in other words if there are blog articles there may be that are essentially copied from the initial two. if the body count method of assigning weight is accepted duplicate/regurgitated articles should probably be ignored.,0

8210,8210,omg you are an imbecile. seriously. lets go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.i rewrote the contribution using only information that i found on the internet that supported the contribution. i did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source. you on the other hand wrote a contribution that did add content to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source making it your opinion. you said things like ... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of arvadas police force.this is libelous because you accuse the arvada police department of criminal conduct when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law. even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found not guilty by your peers. because no one is convicted in the link you provide or any link anywhere on the internet it is your opinion. if you had used the phrase alleged criminal conduct you would be more on track.you also wrote arvadas city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the arvada police despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone during a period of budget crises.the close to half a million dollars was not spent defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone. the money was spent settling out of court so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact. a criminal is someone who has been convicted of a crime. so there cannot be criminal actions unless someone has been convicted of a crime. there can be alleged questionable actions which is what you should have written. when you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion that opens you up to a libel suit. if you do it in a blog and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel. but when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content you cannot just post what you think. you must post what can be verified. do you understand this very basic principle? please read it again if you dont because im done trying to educate you.definition of libel i encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. in the united states opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech falling outside the purview of libel. citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities including government and officials. entertainment parody editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. from how to prove libel there are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. for example in the united states the person first must prove that the statement was false. second that person must prove that the statement caused harm. and third they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. these steps are for an ordinary citizen. you are unable to be objective about the content you are writing because you have a personal emotional feeling or opinion about it. because of this you have no business contributing to wikipedia and its my opinion that you should be banned from doing so. ive made several contacts on this issue and am waiting to hear back.````,0

8263,8263,actually to clarify....after bret hart was forced to vacate the world titleand retire due to a concussion the planned hart vs sid vicious title match was changed less than hours before the match to sid vs benoit. since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish and then build to the rematch at superbrawl the next month. so benoit won the matchwith sids leg clearly on the ropes and then the next night on nitro the decision was overturned. the official result of the sould out main event was chris benoit and sid vicious fought to a nocontest. end of story. except not. pissed off at the shitty booking benoit confronted booker kevin sullivanwho benoit had a personal history with re nancy. sullivan then told benoit if he didnt like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the wwf. the difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before benoit won the title thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his pinning the wrong harris. officially at the time the belt went from hart to a vacant state to kevin nash awarding the belt to himself........okay so vinnie mac has bought at wcw and recognised both benoits and sids first wins as world title wins. he has also recognised hulk hogans two awa dusty finishes as official world title wins. i dont like it but i guess its official now. the obvious question is since vince owns wwe wcw ecw and awa can he say overturn david arquettes wcw world title win at this point? thats just stupid.the sandmanthe sandman won the ecw championship five times not one as the article showswwa world titlewhere did it go?,0

8297,8297,m going to approve it on the basis that the level for approval is a likelihood of passing afd. in this case the likelihood is probably a little better than even. you could improve the article by using a fuller format for references see wprefbegin but that would include the author and title of each item the printed source if any and the online linkeven if the online link is behind a paywall. if it is it will help to give some indication of the extent of coveragethe objections is likely to be that the nyt refs gave him a mere mention. there are two places where specific references are definitely neededi marked them. the claim for his role in the creation of build america bonds seems quite indirect unless he specifically is given credit in a source it might amount to original research which we do not do. id fix these quicklyit is usual for articles on candidates who do not win elections to be nominated for an afd discussion. and be aware that we have feeling of skepticism against articles with an obvious conflict of interest. talk ,0
8298,8298,. this last summary is partly from chapters two three and four in haslett b. b. samter w. . children communicating the first years. mahwah n.j. lawrence erlbaum associates inc. the main idea for chapter two nonverbal communication its origins and development is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction facial expressions and modifying emotional expressiveness. with age childrens encoding sending messages and decoding interpreting messages skills increase. yet children are better at decoding than at encoding a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production haslett b. b. samter w. p. . this fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. the main point for chapter three the development of language is the social development based on the environment of the child. childrens nonverbal communication skills especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication. haslett b. b. samter w. p. good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication mainly nonverbal and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. this chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. the stages include prelinguistic development speech perception/production semantic development private speech and first words. also the main idea for chapter four developing verbal communication and how its relevant in childrens acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. a main focus is discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development for infants emerging abilities to control their communicative skills haslett b. b. samter w. p. . all three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children. ,0

8312,8312,can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty. im certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as problematic. five weeks ago i was getting involved in wikipedia and i was feeling enthusiastic so i posted something to some user groups reaching + members encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia. i thought at the time that longtime wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people and that wikipedians would be happy that i encouraged others to participate. i was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute. the groups i posted to were user groups not employee groups. but yes i guess that some employees belong to these groups as well. and my comment about hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal pov is that he found a good way for someone with coi to contribute. i feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. it is unwelcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors. i see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding. i think that even if i only have time to make a small number of contributions i feel i am helping and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia. so seeing your criticism that i am not making enough edits to noncommercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.i hate feeling that i have to defend my reputation here and i dont agree with you that editing noncommercial pages should improve anyones appearance of trustworthiness. however your claim that i am only editing the wikipedia entries of these commercial products is also just incorrect. i dont know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others but if there is you would see that ive been making edits to many noncommercial pages including crispdm data mining the journal data mining and knowledge discovery predictive analytics statistics customer retention predictive model markup language anomaly detection semma machine learning jacques cousteau sigkdd decision tree learning. sometimes im making simple formatting edits and sometimes im spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the crispdm page. yes my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining because that is where i have the greatest interest and knowledge. similarly when i guest lecture at local universities i lecture to these types of classes not due to any collusion but because thats what i know.thanks for listening to my minirant. i know im taking this more personally than you probably meant it. but it bothers me when someone questions that i am not working hard enough or they question my ethics and thats what your comments feel like. all im asking is that longestablished wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions however small. new people grow and adjust but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community. please be patient and encouraging to new people.im going to leave this discussion now. if needed i will return to it after the holiday season. but i hope there is no need to. ,0

8323,8323,sure. i dont have the necessary knowledge to correct these sections. the most egregious error is the following statement his system of government which may be described as a benevolent despotism was perhaps that best suited to the character of his subjects. this passive construction raises the questions benevolent for whom? described by whom? it implies that the montenegrins were unable to govern themselves and needed a wise father to gently raise them into civilization. if this is true it needs a citation but im sure there were plenty of trade unionists and republicans who disagreed at least slightly the following phrases read as excessively fawning slightly biased or perhaps just worded in an oldfashioned stylethe young highlander whose keen patriotism capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves showed no inclination for the pleasures of the french capital and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.he gave montenegro its first constitution in following pressure from a population eager for more freedom.king nikola was gifted with a fine physique and a commanding presence was a successful military leader and a graceful poeti hope this helps so that someone who has the knowledge to do the edits can update the article accordingly.,0

8326,8326,if they destroy each other they both dont live up to it. irresistable force means nothing can stop it. immovable means the object cant be moved. in both cases beign destroyed contradicts that. something like that means it was a powerful force meeting an equally resistant object. the problem is the adjectives that are absolute. just like the god examples and the greek dog. god cant be absolute if he cant do everything. creating something he cant oppose is something so if he cant do it he isnt absolute but then if he can then he isnt abosolute because he cant oppose it and so cant do everything. laelaps was a dog that always gets what it hunts but jupiter turned it into a static star while it was hunting a fox. since it cant ever move again it cant ever catch the fox and so it doesnt always get what it hunts.,0

8335,8335,now ive checked and unfortunately for true enthusiasts steinberg does not call this work a true choral symphony. he calls it in fact more a cantata than a symphony in the ordinary sense p. . hard for a piece to be a true choral symphony if its not even a true symphony. there is evidence that vaughan williams would have agreed with steinberg and was using the term symphony in the title more or less figuratively roughly in the manner that stravinsky later used it in his symphony of psalms. from ursulas biography p. on of my ralph vaughan williamss most grateful memories of george butterworth is connected with my london symphony....he butterworth said in his characteristically abrupt way you ought to write a symphony. from that moment a moment well past the composition and first performances of a sea symphony the idea of a symphonya thing which i had always declared i would never attemptdominated my mind. ,0

8374,8374,as a matter of curiosity==as a matter of curiosity if a person with a circumcision fetish found his way to this article would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? by the way the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page of the who pamphlet global trends would indicate that the purported hiv protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. would that also target the englishspeaking readers of a wiki site like wikipedia? ... anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the gilgal fellows perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. i have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world african hiv studies on our modern audience to no avail. thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. since there are a number of fellows who edit this article it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the gilgal fellows described here it could be revelatory for circumcision wikipedia to include a section on the gilgal fellows who apparently have quite a mission. its my understanding that gilgal is an obscure word for mountain of burning foreskins. no one having objected to the proposed sections on circumcision fetish and the gilgal fellows i will assume a consensus delegate the research and get back here with it asap. its impossible to assess such a vague proposal. if you provide some specific sourced content we can assess its suitability. ...we can assess... now would that be the royal we or you claim to speak for other fellows? we refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. all the same i dont get why you in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. itll take a lot of human resources to put these sections together... and if the consensus is already fixed in advance whats the point? perhaps its a little presumptuous but its realistic. its usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.as for your proposals previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a circumcision fetish searching google scholar for gilgal society indicates that there are no reliable secondary sources regarding that subject either. so i would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. our policies?... you mean the gilgal fellows? im not certain who youre representing here. wikipedias policies obviously. another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. in trying to improve the circumcision article its important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. thats not a personal attack nor a lack of presumption of good will. its merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article and a healthy cynicism about some readers intransigence. one reader has left a very rude domineering comment on my user page. if personal attacks like that are the norm i can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page. ==,0

8385,8385,heaven of god to understand heaven then god must be understood . god is the all powerful supreme being of the universe. . universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen and defined as everything known and unknown. any concept of a multiuniverse shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces but only one universe. a mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. the subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. the subspace that includes all dimensions is the universe itself. the universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions. . god is either above the universe as the creator or part of some subspace of the universe or both above and part of the universe. the fourth condition that god is not part of the universe and god is not above the universe negates gods existence therefore the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of god. . god is supreme over the universe. it is gods creation and obeys gods rules. each rule can be obvious or nonobvious and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known. . god has the ability to create and destroy energy. without such a thing then the universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist there can still be god as a supreme being of the universe in such a condition but gods energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy. . god is smart is intelligent is wise has knowledge is a creator is good is benevolent has mercy and has understanding. god has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the universe. . god expects gods creation to do well since as a creator then the universe was created for gods purpose and enjoyment therefore life elements of gods creation such as people are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom understanding and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good. . because god is supreme then heaven and its rules of existence are defined by god. . god not only deals with people of earth of our sol system of the milky way galaxy god is a supreme being that can interact with the entire universe in whole or god can interact with the universe in part therefore god truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life and this implies that god may be truly forgiving and god may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important. . it is always believed that god likes people so help from god can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.. god likes to be acknowledged from gods own creation so it is good to acknowledge god as the benevolent intelligent creator of the universe.. love god. love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society family nation benevolence and many good things of life. be who you are as a person and love god and god is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. god has created the universe and has the ability to define heaven in any way. each person can get a personal heaven or heaven may be a interaction for people or heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. heaven is always defined as a good place but a personal heaven can also be a personal hell tailored to your life attitude and existence where god could give us by observation an environment where the individual prospered. the personal heaven and hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species.god can define heaven in any way and heaven is defined as a good place but as a supreme being god can allow many things and maybe god might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm so the possibilities of heaven are expected to be many if not endless possibilities. god is benevolent in heaven and the possibilities are many. love god.,0

8403,8403, the usa under the confederation may have had the same name as the modernday usa but it was not the modernday usa. the usa confederation and the usa union or also called nation are different entities. the argument can be made that while the usa confederacy was a firm league of friendship among a number of free and independent states the usa union was a separate political entity that although it replaced the usa league was something completely different. saying that the articles was the first constitution of the usa and then providing a link to the modernday united states is misleading. my point the article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.and the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the declaration of independence and the articles of confederation and perpetual union.perhaps i didnt express my convictions eloquently enough to be understood since the differences are not easy to distinguish. if im not clear in my explanation point to the unclear parts and ask me to reexplain.,0

8405,8405,it doesnt seem to me that your wikipedia history is a particularly good one. you own wikipedia page shows evidence of potentially hundreds of agravated users. i think what you are trying to say is that in years you have never been caught outright and had your account banned. i would say given your behaviour here and your past history shown by your own personal page is that it is likely is that you have borderline trolled for a number of years. but that is just to say that your history contradicts what you say. ive been quite clear about this right at the start and ive let you know as soon as i felt you were crossing the line. at this stage i warned you and pointed you to wikepedia guideline on trolling. the specific policy you may be in breach of is vandalism.. i am alleging that your behaviour amounts to trolling. you are threatening in effect to vandalize my work. what you are trying to do is in effect bully me to change my work to fit your personal pov. that is plainly a breach of wikipedia policy and guidelines. if you think im somehow getting it wrong and your behaviour is perfectly innocent then by all means go to those sources you yourself suggest. if you come back with a clean bill of health then i am prepared to revise my view. if you get a reliable source to review your posts here and they give their expert view that i am wrong then im quite happy to remove the allegation.with respect to the citations i am the author and so if you are unhappy with the sources ive used and having brought it to my attention but failing to find agreement after having discussed the matter it is up to you to consult a reliable source who is prepared to support your position something ive suggested now a number of times. otherwise we will keep the article as it is. particularly as it has been alleged that you are trolling an allegation which it appears you do not dispute discussing a variety of possiblities does not actually address the allegation. particularly its important that you refrain from making any changes until the allegation has been cleared up. if you dont i intend to follow the wikipedia guidelines on how to deal with vandalism caused by trolls.,0

8421,8421, replaceable fair use image thanks for uploading image i noticed the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. if you believe this image is not replaceable please go to the image description page and edit it to add without deleting the original replaceable fair use template. on the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself.if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on this link. note that even if you follow steps and above fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted days after this notification days if not used in an article per our fair use policy. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. tast ,0

8426,8426,relaunch this was to judge by appearances. as theoretical physicist robert grumbold puts it “it took two decades of it to reveal what the cantab editors were really up to but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. basically if each letter of a cantab article is plotted as a point in an ndimensional space then you find that the piece on the piece on benjamin zephaniah written in early actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψspace. and the city issue of summer is decades if not centuries ahead of its time. the uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist selfaggrandizement in the hallowed cantab tradition. “in fact” says grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a dimensional machine which timelocks a dimensional black hole. we can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. but where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? was it in the pasteup room cupboard? had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in /? is it true that at . am on may a packet of chocolate hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? and why did so few people go into the nearby indian restaurant and so many come out? who or what was the chief editor who subsequently disappeared in south america? did he come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? and why does supernatural sleuth mike dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago years after he’d left cambridge? what is his dark secret? had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? this is evidently one mystery too many even for him. unsigned but by user endoscope,0

8432,8432,language and mindset of a popular s musicali have removed the language and mindset... section of the article. the whole section is very subjective depending entirely on your point of view and could be applied to plenty of films from that era. further none of the information there was cited. i am posting the section here in its entirety for reference. language and mindset of a popular s musicalsome parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of crosby’s character sings a love song to an elevenyearold girl his exwife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughters body while upbraiding her for having no compassion as most characters in the movie have already or soon will and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex separated from the moviegoing masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of or by necessity having to interact with the newport upper class. when tracy lord played by kelly awakens hungover on her wedding day she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing but comes to believe she “made love” with mike the reporter played by sinatra and discusses it at length with her exhusband dexter played by crosby. at the time of course making love was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. being a romantic comedy “high society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.there are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie as kittridge the upandcoming coal magnate and fiance to the current mine owner’s daughter is described as having worked his way up from being a miner and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class as is sinatras journalist character.,0

8439,8439, vandalism on btheory of time it seems perhaps i have been going about this the wrong way so i will try to be helpful and explain why your last edit was vandalism.first off the description intro the quality of the intro had been greatly increased naming mctaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section hence there is no need for it. the description gave a better just of what bthoery of time is a whole. undoing this completely is therefore vandalism especially if you dony first talk about it in the talk page before editing.secondly you removed description you then deleted the description as in metaphysics changed the better updated version of the physics part then moved it in the origin section. there really is nothing i can say about this i have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?....thirdly you removed this section it is noted by dean zimmerman in presentism and the spacetime manifold that atheory is almost certainly a minority view among philosophers while btheory has achieved broad acceptance.it seems you perhaps have a personal agenda favouring atheory therefore editing in favour of it this is not allowed on wikipedia and it is vital to keep a neutral point of view. the above statement however is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.finally and on the most relevant side you craig information it is an improvement that you have put the craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.however a lot of it is not quoted rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. such as...the btheory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory namely that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. the buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality but this is not the case with temporal becoming. you stated this outright. this is an opinion of craigs it should be demonstrated as such i also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. in fact you have stated all of craigs opinions as fact.if you want to make edits please first discuss them in the talk page and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not and how it should be worded.docheuh ,0

8452,8452,upittit block hi orangemikehope you are doing well and i appreciate your work here on wikipedia. i have some questions regarding the block of upittit. although i too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editors responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns as hammersoft had pointed out and editors lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. this could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editors user space but the repeated violations are disconcerting. in fact i cant be entirely sure that the user account is only one person a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy. however it is my understanding that editors are not in wpcoi solely due to their place of employment or username but rather because of the issues of pov reliability and neutrality of their contributions. however in this case my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox the now deleted issues this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work as far as i know had been confined his/hers user sandbox. the editor was an obvious newbie and had twice sought feedback see here and here and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links downsizing of the article rewriting so it was not in violation of wpnotdir and the addition of outside neutral thirdparty references. in fact although i did not see any of the editors additions to this particular article since july th in my opinion it contained useful information was notable and was ready to be moved from the user space into wikipedia proper. mostly i would request that this page be restored as i would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the offline references from various library science journals that had been inserted. i guess you could say that i primarily lament the loss of this particular article. i would appreciate your thoughts on this issue and your review of the dscribe digital publishing article circa the july th version as i would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that sans the copyright violations that hammersoft elucidated. thank you.,0

8467,8467,reply many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants fabric relaxers fabric conditioners. aiui too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers please confirm. the cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures eg celsius. however it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.there does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.again some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers. i would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.some distributors will suggest the use of bleach eg m and its scotchbrite microfiber kitchen cloths and others will specify rather high temperatures. perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but i am not sure how it could have been achieved.,0

8488,8488, pope francis article quote from jerusalem post editorial hi herzen wanted to make sure you saw that i reverted an edit you made on the pope francis article asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. i did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial not an article in the jerusalem post. sorry for my mistake guess it was my sloppy thinking just categorizing editorials and news articles as different types of articles. however i think its a really wonderful quote only positive. the jerusalem post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the jewish community those who live in israel. if we talk about relations between this pope and the jewish community i think its great to have a quote from a paper like that basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the jewish community perhaps richer than any previous pope. anyway i think its a very good quote in a section that addresses the popes prior relationship with the jewish community. i hope youll reconsider your objection. in the meantime i have asked for the opinion of other editors. hope we can all agree best wishes and thanks for all your good work on this article. ,0

8500,8500, zora and aiden you being nonmuslims assume being allknowing about islam and consider me as an ignorant muslims who misinterprets his religion. thanks really for your kind attitude. i was talking at an scholarly level quoting verses from quran you can not revert my edits wholesale just because you dont like them and post your own interpretation there. i dont like to get into a revert war though i am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and i will be the one who will eventually win the debate. you can always add the pov tag to the section and try to find the opinion of other scholars or quote other quranic verses. regarding your point doing original research i would like to say that it is just an excuse and maybe a good strategy to quite the beginners. if we really dont want to do any original research many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted. all the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together. you statement that i am doing original research is by itself an original research it is strange to me that somebody claims that his/her understanding of islam is authentic and the others are just original researchs. ,0
8501,8501,april utc ad . you seem to be ignorant of wikipedia policy. reversion is a conplete overturn of changes by other users. i just salvage vandalised sections and try to improve on other userseditions like goodfaith users do with my additions. you are kindlyu advised to refresh your knowledge of wikipedia guidelines. ad . as long as you dont source and i do your point is moot. ad . badfaith remark unbecoming of an administrator. ad . incorrect statements. islamist sources are claiming that about six million african muslims are converting to christianity which i prove with an al jazeera link. this number probably is at the high side as islamist like to exaggerate to state their points but they acknowledge this statement. ad . if i add reputable sources to support my statements it is not nonsens or or t is encyclopedic writing. you are kindly advised to study applicable guidelines. as the chinese say first check out your own house three times before you try to improve the world. talk contribs px ,0

8506,8506, pov tag vandalism? david starr has reposted the pov alert tag on this page. i do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. he is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page both in the bio. this does not a biased page make.i have clearly refuted both of these claims at length with no response despite repeated requests from starr. the garbage passage is balanced with an explanation from a da spokesperson. the source is quoted phrase is neutral and source scholar georg feuerstein is not in dispute by starr. the mention is crucial because it explains the controversial aspect in first line of lead and period is alluded to in adidam apologies for controversial earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits news articles and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in da page. also further explained by da himself in crazy wisdom section in teaching. mention of breakdown/divine emergence. this is a significant event as attested by adi da press. source is not biased all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. balanced with adi da selfassessment as personally significant event about which an entire book was written.undue weight was shown to be unreasonable as each line is short without subjective exposition. on balance throughout page all potentially controversial material in every case sourced cited and neutrally phrased is far outweighed by neutral info and da selfassessment. every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source and balanced with an alternate explanation. in every case. source disputes gurdjieff journal no specific instances of bias are alleged by starr from this source. starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from da rudi and siddha yoga accounts. no bias is reflected in wp entry no has any been revealed. and starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or selfpublished simply making assertion that it is a competing religious organization which is simply unproven there is no gurdjieff church or organization. lake county news source has been used for other articles starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike the divine emergence passage. he has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months as demonstrated by its repeated use. starr cannot singly enter now and discount source when not showing wp guideline that effectively discounts it only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the contact page on their website.all other editors including myself have been involved in give an take on this page making allowances and corrections for each other even yesterday i made changes to accommodate other editors including starr. i do not feel that starr is meeting this standard and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. because of this i am removing the pov tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. i have requested third party review and perhaps further dispute resolution. ,0

8509,8509,i could have been reminded too but was banned and then threatened by you in response. the policy here is often to ban first and ask questions later. i think i am just about done with wiki. it is a laughing stock of an encyclopedia lampooned daily in the press and print world. the onion daily show colbert report have all picked on it for just the kind of thing i encountered daily as an editor here. it seems that censorship is the core issue behind almost all of what afflicts the site yet when it is called out by a fellow contributor it gets some phony we are all friends being neutral rhetoric lobbed back and no progress is ever made. you say you are following the rules even if you are there are higher rules like truth which should trump the petty stuff but that whole just following orders excuse is so typically self defeating it embarrasses me to say i am human. at what point does a person ask the tougher question like what is the truth and hold that question to a standard that trumps all other things? example that is why men get hanged when a judge decides dna evidence wont be used. no one is interested in truth they would rather hang an innocent than seek or pursue the truth. does it matter that the dna evidence came in on a thursday at pm after the evidence cutoff time for that judges jurisdiction or does it matter more that the evidence shows clear innocence? you would be the guy saying revert rule clearly states no evidence therefore all that follows is inadmissable. you are that guy who gasses jews and says the rules as you interpeted them suggested that was within the guidelines laid out by the almight founder of wiki and you are the guy strip searching year old women on airlplanes in search of bombs because the rules clearly state search everyone. no common sense is left in the entire world but we in the us are committed to our stupidity moreso than most.what ever happened to good ole common sense. go back and read through what was posted in the exchanges and try to fix the article. offer something constructive to the world and stop haggling over the small stuff. you make no mention of the substance of the article just enlightening me about the rules. thanks ,0

8550,8550,gilles tréhini have listed this article at wpdrv for possible undeletion based on information i have received regarding a book that has been written by trehin about his fictional city urville. interested parties should contribute to the discussion. is this still deserving of featured article status?im beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles. it seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article. this should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia. instead it reads as if asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it. the very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling as a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling. i really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks. im not looking for an argument. im simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is i will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.,0

8592,8592, trees and grass how is the tree planting doing in somalia? did they reach yet? it seems that simply planting tress helps make it rain more. in areas in europe where there have previously been no trees can reduce the effect of climate change by cooling temperate regions forget about they need to plant a couple million trees in mogadishu asap . k was in the northeast asfaik. tree planting does though apparently invigorate ecosystem. best regards hey . they need to stop cutting down trees in somalia as its already a serous. as of only sq. km of somalia is covered in forest or .% of the whole country. this is a significant drop from when they sq. km in or .% of the whole country. so basically it went from the size of austria to that of georgia in the span of years they need to act fast and plant more trees to cover the loss. do you know why they cut down trees? is it for power? thats just stupid. ,0

8648,8648,edit conflict. i am very exasperated by the rant above. i have really tried to respond to all of your points jugi but i dont think you will be satisfied by any reply other than complete agreement. i am sorry if i accused you of anything you have not done i apologize. lets go back to your sentence about the accuracy of memris translations. i asked you to reproduce your refs on the talk page for the sake of clarity of discussion but instead of helping me out by doing that you spend screen after screen berating me for not answering you. ok here they are ^ a b mayor of london press release ^ a b c d yigal carmon osama bin laden tape threatens u.s. states november ^ a b ramona smith did osama send election threat? philadelphia daily news november .carmon whitaker email debate. ok lets discuss these refs livingston press release is unacceptable as a rs on this. livingston does not have any translation expertise in arabic. he is therefore not an acceptable cite on the accuracy of translation. you are using carmons own translation to say that memris translations are inaccurate? that is quite bizarre. ramona smithi dont know what more i can sy about this. she is talking about the binladen tape. i believe the only person she quote with any translation expertise is cole. aljazeera the most prominent arabic news source iin the world translated the same way memri did. juan cole disputed the translation after the fact saying that binladen was not using standard arabic and also disputed their interpretation. no one in the world excpet for binladen knows what he meant to say in that tape. this is not enough of an example to generalize from. could you consider reproducing the part of the whitaker piece that refers to the accuracy of translation here for discussion? i have read those articles a fewtimes and believe that whitaker came up with one minor example. i also note that you keep inserting a cole quote and his blog is not an acceptable source for this article. finally you want to use headings selectivity and bias and then place quotes under one or the other that contain sentences which contain both types of crits. i split up some of the quotes so that the ideas of the critics would come under the appropriate headings. you object to this and say your version is more well written. i disagree. im not sure what more to say about this. elizmr it does not help our conversation for you to refer to my statement to you as a rant. and it does not help our conversation for you to falsely accuse me of doing things i have not done as you apologized for above nor to falsely accuse me of not doing things that i have done as you just did above. i did provide references to my citations above in this talk page more than a week ago but you never responded see here. i even made the links easy to use simply click on them in the text i added.elizmr lets discuss them in the order you cited. the first is a mayor of london press release published by the greater london authority city hall and available on the website. do you claim that this is not a rs? your objection that the mayor of london livingstone is not personally a certified translator is absurd this press release is available from the city hall in arabic and other languages so clearly he did not prepare this document personally but with the help of a staff that spoke arabic. would you try to deny a statement by george bush about iran in a wp article because he is not personally trained to translate persian? your argument is just plain silly.i am using carmons statement to prove to you that the cole dispute was about translation since you were questioning that above. memris president makes this statement the u.s. media in general mistranslated the words. so clearly he considered this dispute to be about translation.ramona smith published her article about the cole dispute in the philadelphia inquirer. do you claim that this newspaper is not a rs? in her article she writes that supposed warning to red states was lost in muddled american translations released with the video last week the middle east media research institute claimed. but translation problems or no experts at a variety of prominent think tanks disagreed with the idea that bin laden was preparing to sort out safe states from target states. do you see why this is clearly a dispute about memri translation in a rs?whitaker and carmon debated in a special report in the guardian u,0

8764,8764,to overcome these limitations some fungi such as armillaria form rhizomorphs or mycelial cords it was not until i searched rhizomorphs that it became clear that the term is synonymous with mycelial cords. i suggest either making it clearer that they are the same or simply dropping one and keeping whichever is more prominently used in the literature.characteristics shared with plants include a similar pathway in the biosynthesis of large organic molecules with important roles in cellular development and for defense called terpenes. after rereading this sentence multiple times it isnt clear if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of large organic molecules and cellular development / defense or if terpenes are involved in biosynthesis of organic molecules which are themselves related to cellular development / defense. the latter interpretation seems more logical but if that is the case why does this introductory sentence on terpenes complicate itself by introducing seemingly unnecessary information on organic molecules?however the biochemical pathways for the synthesis of similar or even identical compounds often differ markedly between fungi and plants which is shown by studies that have demonstrated that the fungal and plant enzymes for making these compounds differ strongly in their sequence and other characteristics indicating that they have evolved separately in fungi and plants. this is a very long sentence. consider slicing it into smaller sentences for better readability.more than species display the phenomenon of bioluminescence of mycelia or fruiting bodies. this seems like a bit of a non sequitor for this paragraph. perhaps it would be better placed in the diversity section?,0

8803,8803,if someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken. it is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered and to give the editor a chance to stop. in fact a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first. i do think that more friendly wording might have been used rather than i will report you to wikipedia admins and have you blocked but i have seen far more uncivil warnings than that. the ip editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article and since you say that you are done with the article it may be that he/she will leave it at that. if the ip editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article then please come back and tell me as that may well be harassment and action may well be needed but if what has happened so far is the end of it then i dont see any reason for not just letting it drop. ,0

8821,8821, == issue on images still unresolved == i appreciate your inputs in image talk and i agree once in a while i might sound rude purely unintentional since i put facts blantly. but slimvirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.slim is not a he. given that she named herself after a javanese princess perhaps you could take the hint and note that shes a woman. also i dont think you were simply blunt. i think you were rude to slim. i recognise its a fine line but given that ive mentioned it to you perhaps youll take more care to stay on the right side of it?she has suggested in an email to me that she is in talks with another editor. now i dont know who this other editor and i certainly dont like this secrecy. instead of having a discussion on this she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. she couldve atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. i think that would be reasonable. i have a high regard for slim and i dont think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.inso far as the images are concerned i had stated to her a couple of images on one issue animal rights is ok but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by peta and its assocites.so you have a dispute. you need to recognise that you are not necessarily right you disagree about how many images are necessary. i feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.this should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.the buav is not a controversial organisation. it is a highly respected body whose voice is listened to in all circles of british society. a viewpoint doesnt become controversial just because you dont share it.wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.i dont see how it is any fairer to use one two or ten images in this instance. while i agree that slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images i simply dont feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use thats true but its only one factor and obviously each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.as far as the other images some are on personalities she claims have agreed to use their photos here. unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe.first of all you can believe slim because you assume good faith. perhaps youre not aware of that policy. yes you can ask slim to provide evidence of that but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you wont believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.once i pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.yes okay. trust her and ask for proof.both of us are editing in good faith but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other me relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.id urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. yes slim does have powerful friends who will back her regardless but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then im afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information.i think thats a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules which exist for good reason and shouldnt be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. however she is not a copyviolater trying to destroy wikipedia. partly i think she simply didnt understand your problem and that was in part a failure of your communication and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesnt handle disagreement well. so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? i know,0
8822,8822,mixednocs doesnt represent any subtotal contrary to eu gdp in your example it is rather arbitrary mix of athletes from different countries.the current medal table serves the sole purpose of noc comparison and mixednocs introduces some confusion into this comparison. look it is definitely listed for comparison here taking its place according to its medal count even without rank assigned. why not to show another medal table to the right of the current medal table? and this second table would contain medals of different nocs won by athletes within mixednoc teams. mixednoc competitions shouldnt be considered somewhat less relevant so this table is also a relevant one. it is separated just because theres no valid reason to combine them together within noc medal table since it would compromise the purpose of noc comparison.,0

8848,8848,restoring to the original version.==the article has been restored to its original bclass version before the edits by by. the pib article on which by made the edit is incorrect that report was submitted by the army. from the article the standing comitteed to which the report was submitted says there were clear factual inaccuracies in the armys deposition before the standing committee. the most glaring of them is the armys suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the arjuns performance.in fact the army has already accepted the arjun for introduction into service based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. after firing trials in summer the trial report written by the army said the accuracy and consistency of the arjun has been proved beyond doubt.the ongoing trials in pokhran that the army is citing are accelerated usage cum reliability trials aucrt. in these two arjun tanks were run almost nonstop for kilometres not to judge performance but to evaluate the tanks requirement of spare parts fuel and lubricants during its entire service life. i would like by to prove that indeed the problems mentioned in the article is that mentioned in the pib article from latest sources after the parliamentary committee agreeing about the pib report being wrong.also i request admins not to revert back. until by proves the above requested things his edit will become unverifiable and based on the pib report which is incorrect. thank you all. ==,0

8862,8862, to boris tsirelson you stated no one is entitled to remove or edit others comments. yet that has been repeatedly done to my comments. you are applying a double standard. either no one is allowed to edit or everyone is allowed to edit as per wikipedia the free encyclopedia. prejudice to which editors are allowed to edit and which ones are not is a violation of free speech in the united states and a contradiction to a free encyclopedia.nature is not a feeling or a theory. either it is superdeterministic or it is not hence absolute. philosophy has nothing to do with the laws that govern our existence. please feel free to conduct the thought experiment to prove nature wrong and the crankery bunch opinions are valid. if you understood what the meaning of absolute meant you would have also understood that opinions in contradiction to natures laws will always be invalid. ,0

8864,8864, was beautiful really pitched to pink? i have a problem with the caption below pinks photo originally the song was initially pitched to pink from what ive heard on tv specials interviews and such of linda and pink... the song was never pitched to pink she heard it before simply because she was working with linda but linda never meant for pink to get the song. in fact linda wanted to record the song herself and changed her mind only after hearing christina sing it in the stripped sessions which was if im correct moths after misunderstood was finished. ,0
8865,8865,what proof do you have that nowruz is persian holiday?? you are allowing the false information to be presented to the public? there is certainly no evidence of holiday to be of persian iranian or zoroastrian origin. i goes back to the sumerian festival of akitu persians came to the plato along with other iranian speakers after the ancient civilisations were already established there. aryans certainly changed the name of many geographic locations including the names of holidays. i believe any reference to persian or iranian must be amended with word near east or at least iranian plate as in reference to the geographic location rather specific ethnicity.,0

8879,8879,youre certainly correct that the kerry article isnt a direct parallel to this one. the kerry article reports on flatout lies that were told about kerry. in many countries he would have been able to win a defamation lawsuit about the statements quoted in our article. american law provides a high degree of protection to people who make false statements about elected officials. thus our article gives greater currency to lies about kerry. by contrast no one has pointed to any lies about rick santorum that would be squelched or even given less currency by the deletion/merger/renaming/whatevering of this article. compared to the swiftboating of john kerry the use of santorums name in a nondefamatory way is minor. as for streisand if some limbaugh nastiness about her gets the level of attention thats been given to frothy mix start the appropriate article. when the deletionists come howling for your head or at least for deletion please drop me a note on my talk page so i can prove my integrity by opposing deletion.  t c ,0

8919,8919,mark i am sorry for your desperation ill refrain from skepticism but it is both misguided and misplaced. the issue is far wider than a dialog with promoldovan interests. it is a a dialog with russoskeptic interests—and since mauco has branded me a partisan ill identify that as my partisanship. i do not see this as an ethnic struggle for selfdetermination of ukranians and russians from moldovans. i see it as a naked russian power play and not the only such one currently to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against nato expansion. regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets no impartial observer—and certainly no russoskeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as minimally the authorities from the top to the bottom are replaced with transnistrian natives not populated by russian citizens including omon thugs who transplanted to transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the baltics by violent and deadly means failed and russia and ukranian forces completely vacate the transnistrian territory that is all arms all troops and raze all arms depots to the ground.when that happens and people then dance in the streets then i will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.   you keep talking about the parliaments opposition to smirnov. as a russoskeptic i will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some elections which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. we can seriously discuss the will of the peopleafter every russian in the pmr authorities is out as in out and out of the countryafter the foreign troops are all out as in out of the country and their arms depots demolishedand i dont mean russian military retiring to become citizens of the pmr eitherafter it is legal for a political party to be promoldovan that currently being treason andafter romanian is once again taught in its proper latin script not in some cyrillic sovietera utter bastardization created purely to support the stalinist fiction that moldovans are not romanians.then we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation. i have the patience to wait for that discussion do you?   if the russoskeptics disagree with anything ive represented please feel free to correct. — ,0

8933,8933,firstly i am not fixated on nor am i carrying on a dispute with epeefleche and i certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. if you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be what its worth my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. i first posted a message on epeefleches talk page explaining the minor changes i had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. i also explained the obvious issue i had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list before posting on the article talk page. i do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way and thought i had responded in a reasonable manner to all epeefleches comments while trying to return the focus onto the article. i repeat i do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. i cannot be any clearer on that.i have acknowledged that i should not have engaged in repeated reverting and i see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this my response to greg l was over the top and i should have done as i usually do – dont click the save page button and just ignore it but its too late now. bigissue ,0

8960,8960,i disagree. nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it’s used in support of a discussion about causal theories which in this case it would be.i recommend that people take a look at how this issue is handled by other similar wikipedia articles particularly race and intelligence which has been at least as hotly contested as this one. although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this iq difference the iq difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart. this image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.the original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the doj website and i think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also. the only question that needs to be considered is whether the data represented in the image is relevant to the article which in this case it clearly is.,0

8962,8962,no worries here against readding it—i understand where youre coming from. i suppose its moreorless common sense to me that its impossible to give someone a warning to stop vandalism if they are not active now with vandalism. to give somebody a warning for example to stop eating makes little sense if they are not currently eating. thus the socalled warning is not actually a warning at all because there is no logic to hold it together. just now however i realize that this is probably quite beyond common sense so i would have no issue if you readd that bit. · talk ,0

8964,8964,as far as i can tell learned people dont express their opinions as either vatican ii is infallible or vatican ii is not infallible. everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions so the question really is whether vatican ii promulgated any dogmatic definitions. even the famous pope paul vi quote that traditional catholics always cite uses this terminology“there are those who ask what authority what theological qualification the council intended to give to its teachings knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the churchs infallible teaching authority. the answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of march repeated on november . in view of the pastoral nature of the council it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” general audience december published in the losservatore romano // ,0

9020,9020, utccommentsthis is the first article i nominate to gareview please tell me if i miss anything. walk victor falk talk what about those taken prisoner by the british/allies in the middle east. also those who refused to join the free french in britain and were repatriated back to france.? i respect this point but were talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in germany. thats what the scholarship covers and its that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. everything else a tiny fraction by comparison is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. yes french soldiers were probably taken prisoner from indochina to britain north africa to the middle east. but they pale into insignificance when compared with the million in germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about french prisoners but only deal with the germanheld ones. so i see your point but i cant really do anything about it. it just isnt out there. yesterday i was editing freefrancesyriaandeastafrica and as it mentioned how only out of chose to join free france while the rest wanted to be rapatriated my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like french wwii powsvichy prisoners to target in this article. however as notes some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances such as beeing spies obvious traitors collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a pow by international conventions for the allies rank and file vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation no questions asked and their incarceration as pows always a temporary affair. i can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as axis and especially japanese ones after the coup in march eliminated any fiction of vichy rule in indochina but sources about that might be very elusive to find and anyway probably more within the scope of the pows held by the japanese wikipedia article. at the most a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere to dispell the same curiosity from readers that youve shown. walk victor falk talk reviewer seems to be active on wikipedia but has not done anything to this review in almost weeks. if no progress is made within the next days hours i will close the review. talk im here will be for the rest of the week at least. walk victor falk talk just for future use when you add a ping without any text it will not go through. the template is a little picky as you need to add the ping and some sort of text after it all in one edit for it to work. talk still no start on the review ? june,0

9029,9029, unprotected im going to edit based on my comments in talknewantisemitismsourcingclaimsfor.countryspecificincidents so could we discuss them now? all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new antisemitism i.e. coming from the left related to radical antizionism etc. talk they may well be but they are not sourced that way. i dont think we can expect the words new antisemitism to appear in every single report we reference. weve defined it and weve linked to many sources who are defining it. the definition isit is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left. it is characterized by the demonization of the worlds only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion. israels right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. the jewish peoples right of selfdetermination is denied. double standards are applied whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state. symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism are used for example blood libels are resurrected the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world or being in control of other governments or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. arab and islamic antisemitism are excused and ignored. strawman attacks are made whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is antisemitism and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable and to deny that there is any such thing as the new antisemitism. all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools particularly in europe. it is found in conjunction with antiamericanism because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government antizionism and the antiglobalization movement.all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components so when we find them we can offer them as examples so long as someone has discussed them in terms of antisemitism or attacks on jews. talk my worry is that livingstone has not been at least in the sources provided accused of antisemitism and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of antisemitism against his supporters. add to that that we appear to be accusing them of antisemitism not reporting others allegations which is or and unwise in the case of galloway. the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new antisemitism so id just want to tidy that up. livingstone has very definitely been accused of antisemitism got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it as has galloway and without question his supporters. the section talks about it in relation to that election. by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit and we can talk later if there are any disagreements. talk slim whose definition is this? all the sources put together. the above are the issues they agree on. it was posted weeks ago. talk i think you mean all the sources from one side of the argument put together. its been a while since we discussed this so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative? sorry youll have to look in the archives theyre either there or in the article. by all the sources i mean all the sources who study new antisemitism. the above are the elements they appear to agree on. talk im asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative. please respond. userc,0

9038,9038,why did you delete the one source that weve been talking the most about? why do you want to hide the truth from readers? the concepts of qi and meridians are very contentious because they dont exist from a reductionist disectionist western medical science point of view. do you want to know what meridians are? every type of tissue muscle fiber etc is wrapped up and enclosed in fascia. meridians are the spaces in between these fascia you are never going to find them by cutting bodies apart and looking at them in a microscope. they are the nothingness that provides function as in verse of the tao te ching thirty spokes convergein the hub of a wheelbut the use of the cartwill depend on the parton the hub that is void.with a wall all arounda clay bowl is moldedbut the use of the bowlwill depend on the partof the bowl that is void.cut out windows and doorsin the house as you buildbut the use of the housewill depend on the spacein the walls that is voidso advantage is hadfrom whatever is therebut usefulness arisesfrom what is not.these interfascial spaces have increased salt concentrations and thus increased electroconductivity properties and it is the manipulation of the bioelectrochemical energy i.e. qi in these spaces which acupuncture seeks to accomplish.now yes this is original research on my behalf and cannot be included in the text. but the source which is suggestive of such must be included in the text ,0

9047,9047, italics for wordsaswords in plant articles like pumpkin it is normal to use quotation marks rather than italics as per moswordsaswords when italics could cause confusion quotation marks instead may be used to distinguish words as words. this is because italics mark scientific names. i dont think the change you made at pumpkin matters but elsewhere it might create confusion for readers not familiar with the scientific names involved. as an example citrus is used both as a common name and as the genus name cistrus. it would be confusing to use italics to mark citrus as reference rather than a use. ,0

9049,9049, mormonism and history merge proposal storm i saw your note on trodels page and wanted to touch base. i am definately against merging primarily because placing the topic in history of the latter day saint movement reduces it to a one time issue. the most recent pattern of faithpromoting history was as a byu trained historian i sincerely hope a one time event. but mormonism and history is a much bigger topic closer to historiography having implications from josephs time to the present. i dont know if this is the right title for such an article but we are having a restructuring discussion on the mormonism and history page. please drop in and give your two cents. and besides there is certainly little room for more material in history of the latter day saint movement best wishes as always. ,0

9092,9092,==name==ive been studying satmar for a good bit and ive been to kiryas joel. ive never heard it called sakmer. are we sure about this? ive been around many hasidim for a long long time too and i have never heard of sakmer either so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed. there is a street in kj called sakmeralso look at this the reason some call it sakmer is because the name satmer is based on satu mare which remotely referes saint mary note not true satu mare means simply large village in romanian. hassidic jews have always refrained from sanctifying christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. izak love when you dont know something that does not make it balony. ps i havent been studying satmer i am one and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as sakmer aka satu mare. pps there is no kj street called sakmer. the photo you attached clearly dubbs the satmar rabbi the rav of sakmer. for those who study satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the satmers use the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this סאקמער. the third letter from the right carries the k sound. cheers.i recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor greatgrandfather? of his called satmar sakmer. why do they not utilize that term anymore? and im done with my hardcore pshat study of different hasidic groups. its total nonsense the saint mary story. satu mare means large town. my father has been there many times. wikipedia yes yes also says that satu mare means large town and that saint mary is something else entirely in hungarian/romanian. i revised the opening paragraph by indicating the satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups it is widely thought there are about lubavitchers but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role this is all conjecture it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest there is no way of knowing. about satmar and neturei karta. the cherem bit is incorrect as is the bit of a denunciation. also the part of asking reb yoilish to meet with yasser arrafat. its all myth. yasser arafat and the plo were not the public face of the palestinian cause before reb yoilish had his stroke so it doesnt make sense. i actually asked a chaver of the satmar beis din about the cherem and he said its nonsense. the beis din has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the united states. no denunciation was issued either. its a made up propaganda piece by the kakhnik radio station arutz sheva. it never happened. no such thing ever appeared in der yid which is the official newspaper. good editgood recent edit izak. ¸ø¤º°`°º¤ø¸¸ø¤º°`°º¤ø¸ july utc etymology with satu coming from the same root as city civitasactually its not like this. in romanian satu is derived from latin fossatum and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat in latin fossa. cetate is the romanian word derived from civitas. talk npovpeople have mistaken this article to be a fork of it is not. and due to its encylopaedic nature please do not appeal to users to refrain from making a chilul hashem because frankly nobody gives a shite. the purpose of this site is informative not satmers or judaisms pr page nor is it a private opinion venting station. if you are a member of this site and its npov policy is not in accordance with your religious beliefs you are kindly requested to hold your peace. state the true unfiltered truth but only that please. aaronzalman conflictapparently someone has made this subsection its own page again. thoughts anyone? is it enough of an issue to have it be its own page separate from satmar the dynasty? you bet this issue s,0

9106,9106,licinius the more you explain your position the more i think youre reading something into the current wording that just plain isnt there. saying aussie rules is an australian variety of football does not say that it is more australian than gridiron nfl is the competition not the game is american. it doesnt say that australians havent had great influence on rugby league. the descriptions of the sections dont need to be and in fact shouldnt be in the same format since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. the different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. there are two very obvious big groups both easily characterised by their ancestry the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. the rest of the codes all relatively minor in global terms cannot be characterised by a single ancestry and so shouldnt be. they are a group of games some influenced by both soccertype games and rugby school rules with various influences within the group as well that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all australian or irish in origin. saying some of them are australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are unaustralian any more than calling gaelic football an irish variety implies that irish soccer players are not irish/gaelic ,0

9126,9126,hi. re ɰ /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as . this sound is not phonetically w because it does not have lip rounding so some folks including me feel that <ɰ> is a more appropriate symbol. was useful because it was found on typewriters while <ɰ> had to be written in by hand. computers are getting better at displaying this stuff so i say use the more accurate symbol. ç is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. ç is an allophone of /h/ but ɰ is not. actually ɰ is redundant since it is just a short ɯ like j is a short i and w is a short u — we could just use a nonsyllabic diacritic. re j j is supposed to mean /j/. it doesnt include /ɰ/ — c+/ɰ/+v is not allowed. in other words japanese allows an optional /j/ before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset i.e. v or /j/+v or c+v or c+/j/+v. feb utc,0

9129,9129, background section at the present time the background section cites unspecified interviews with the media according to which ahmed claimed to take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.the sentence is taken verbatim from the npr article. however it links to a dallas news article which says no such thing to a dallas news interview which also does not contain this statement and mentions a wfaa interview which ive been unable to find. ive checked four different interviews with ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.if such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by npr it would be nice to have a direct link a quote and a date.the problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. when the story broke on / the device was consistently described by the media as a homemade clock or an invention. the fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a wfaa article which quoted irving police on / but otherwise mostly ignored. it only went viral so to speak when dawkins waded into the controversy on / and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.much of the immediate reaction from obamas tweet and zuckerbergs invitation to dawkins lashing out seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock. ,0

9139,9139,youre mixing apples and oranges historical scholarship is not required for wikipedia to add information say on a claim to the bosnian throne. sorry no one has claimed the croatias yet. to add that information to the list of many other claimants around the world does not require approval from the pope but it does reqire that the claimant has a in fact made the claim and that b news sources reported on it that are considered respectable in that country. since the news source were talking about here are online alexa is the criterion for their as any other online ranking of news portals because their high position in alexa means high readership. in the news business this is how you measure success. the sources that reported on the claim are not tabloids but conventional news portals as anyone can see etc. please be respectful others have brains and eyes too and stop the edit war. thanks for the diagram. if you look at it closely youll realize youre not even attempting to compromise meaning youre the one not following wpeditconsensus. instead you keep making total reverts canceling entire edits which took hours of someones valuable time without ever discussing it in talk. by being so obviously rude you also remove dozens of reliable references such as in ban borić article where your remove all history ebooks from the google scanning project with a single hit of a button. never heard of a rule saying that google scanning project is bogus and banned from wikipedia. thats malicious editing plain and simple. please stop edit war. or to use your catholic vocabulary please stop the crusade.,0
9140,9140,i didnt utter any threat to anybody and i have looked at this link of yours stop making a fool of yourself by ignoring the facts. you pretend as if it was a threat but it wasnt. it cover what is actually going on and i am in my rightd to inform a person of what his actions have result in. you do not have the right to supress this warning unless you contact me and/or give an explaination for your reason to suppress it. you failed to do any iof it.i idnt receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me yhought your message above is dated of the of august it wasnt there at that date and i am sure of it. i didnt have acces to anything that day.about the things i edit they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.all pseudo subbjects are all lies as the bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web inclusiv wiki at different times for the past years.for days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about and seeing that ybm used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they dint have answered the questions at hand and that way confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case as he has always done since .someone has to stand up and say it someone has to put an end to this circus and i choose to do so.i do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the bogdanov but through this affair that i begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.two things became clear for me as i scanned all the web on the subjects ybm was the person doing all the staging and ybm didnt knew what he was talking about. i also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him he will keep asking and accusing peoples and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.and of course especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic those people phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.so they left and never show up again leeving all free room that ybm could ever wish for to pursue his goal.but what was this goal exactly?it wasnt the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.he was repeating himself and soon i saw a pattern emerging from all his apparitions on the web with falsh accusations lies home made stories fantasyfull evidences links to web sites from his own making agression personal attacs insults.his goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. t>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.then i was contacted by people who had been confronted to him prior to this case and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.i stude it and saw worse than i could ever imagined. it was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.it is what they call post situationism and wich is issued of voyer. in the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer on cooking books he had just met voyer but been found of him for a longer time by the beginning of bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of voyer and co and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this confrerie.that is the reason why this article i come with is of such importance. it reveal what was behind all along what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.there is no bogdanov affair it is an illusion a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.brillant unless there was casualties.and there is.plenty of and more than the bogdanovs private sphere and their career.i was really aroused from the beginning when i realised what ybm was about but even more when i saw what it all was really about i was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of ybm not kn,0
9141,9141,did christians invent satan.the idea that christians invented satan is lies propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job so why blame the christians rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent who had refused to worship adam also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan old testament samuel later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul satan by pharisees jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees. in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west. so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st. michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels revelation also reveals woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. christ was tempted by the shaitan times after his baptism in the desert. so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious. the devil had pride then disobedience then jealousy then slander then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar murderer and thief.why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions? why so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists. even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara who was a tempter. jesus even spoke to st. peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st. peter like wheat whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation. the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven who became too full of himself later whe god created man in his own image god requests all the angels to bow to adam all do except for one angel later called lucifer. he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay however god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job some mention that in isaiah o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil but i also consider it to babyloon as in revelation fallen fallen is babylon the great etc. revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. god has talks with the satan so satan can not be inferred thence to be a nonentity as god does not talk to nonentities. also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil others realise that this is negative nonsense. i know that people were possessed by demons fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming ha jesus you nazorean what hast thou to do with us hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible some truth is also in the quran.there are some truths to be found also in other religious books but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit. have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits. pagans invented their gods and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.jews and christians had the opposite god revealed to them the truth and the way and the life.thanksemail jameshernonthe next seion is not written by me james hernon,0

9176,9176,what follows is a discussion with donaldrichardsands transferred from my user talk page dear donaldrichardsandsthe link for the revised article is here thanks for taking a look. from what you wrote above i understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. i would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. all best i think it would be more accurate to say the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. however and this is what will take the time the old version does have merits which should not be lost. there is an energy among some people to show that berezovsky is a mafialike boss. when i told a friend about berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how i would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article my friend expressed shock and dismay that i would risk my life so. the article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. this balance is what takes the time. i would enjoy helping. your energy for the article is obvious. if we could get an editor who wants to portray berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration the article could strengthen quickly. in the article i am working on presently one other editor is active and he is very critical. but he and i have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. similar cooperation could happen for the berezovsky article. rely on secondary sources. insist on a conservative scholarly examination of all aspect of berezovskys life. and yes i still want to email him ask him for a picture and perhaps go for coffee. dear donaldrichardsands thank you for your input. of course mr. berezovsky is a highly controversial person and i think all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. but he is a major figure who influenced russian political history over two decades and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake but for the sake of the whole russia block on wikipedia. with respect the belief of some people that berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion which is not supported by facts. if an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous it has no place on wikipedia regardless of how many people may hold it. otherwise we should change the rules and make wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. under current rules we should work with well sourced facts. the facts in this matter are as follows. that particular opinion has originated from a single source mr. klebnikov whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. the publication forbes which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. dozens of profiles of mr. berezovsky in major world newspapers which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism including serious russian sources do not repeat these allegations. i believe that wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. the revised article states the sourced facts as they are there was an opinion voiced which was then discredited. of course if anyone can quote another reputable source which supports this opinion with evidence it should be mentioned. since i am going on vacation i have put the revised text on the main page and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version which can be accessed via history tag amend challenge and comment as long as it is done by the rules. the last thing i want is another edit war. on the other hand seeking consensus is just one of wikipedia rules. avoiding pushing opinions and removing unsourced slander is another. ,0

9182,9182,more on guarnelloguarnello m/f. both a kind of linen or cotton textile and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... the guarnello rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. it is worn by children as a simple washable garment and possibly also by pregnant women. there are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing. dress in renaissance italy by jacqueline herald humanities press nj quoted herethe coarse overdress for working women definition is from the world of renaissance florence by francesco adorno translated by w. darwell giunti isbn .page this site saysa loose sheer overdress worn over a regular dress was used at home and after birth hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs botticellis three graces wears in his primavera but it can also be seen in his portrait of smeralda brandini in london.that may also be following herald which is listed as one of the sources.the fabric is also translated as fustian which would seem to be the coarser variety.and heres the kicker an article in the globe and mail quoted with the crucial next line here saysmona lisa had recently given birth to a baby a team of canadian and french scientists announced tuesday so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish the researchers found that leonardo da vincis model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time or mothers who had recently given birth. the filmy robe was called a guarnello. ,0

9186,9186, re history merges the instructions are all laid out at wikipediahow to fix cutandpaste moves. as i found out quickly when you try to move an article from title a to title b and title b already exists the software will automatically delete the edits of title b for you when you move the article. try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in mediawiki. also its a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldnt be reverted. once i was history merging melbourne and a wellmeaning editor tried to move it back while i was working on the history merge which resulted in melbourne disappearing from wikipedia for a few minutes. maybe ill try the same thing at auckland one day . hope this helps some. ,0

9197,9197,improvement needed while ive declined speedy deletion i see two major areas that require improvement in the article.notability while there are some assertions of significance such as winning seedcamp its not entirely clear how major that competition is. accordingly theres no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. imo theres enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion a however it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.reliable sourcing other than basekits website the only source provided is a review at download squad. it appears to be on par with engadget in terms of reliability. still to build a robust article and demonstrate general notability citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.my personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate but if its not improved over the next few weeks it is subject to being nominated for deletion. — talk,0
9198,9198,sorry but no. the idea of a partial rather than site ban is that a user can probably be a productive contributor to the encyclopedia but needs to disengage from a particular area. using various usertalk pages as a proxy for talkclimatic research unit hacking incident would not serve that purpose. if a user approaches you with a specific limited question it is probably okay though less than ideal to render an answer including reference to this temporary ban users who repeatedly make such approaches after being informed of the ban might be engaged in baiting attempting to game the system or otherwise editing disruptively. thank you for seeking clarification. / cont.,0

9203,9203,reviewing your sources.... msm in africa does not contain the string trans anywhere in the document. i dont know what you expect in that document being used as a reference except to increase your refcount. unaids states that tg is typically considered alongside. it is fairly equivocal about the whole matter. the powerpoint document gives the most convincing argument with the statement with regard to hiv surveillance and prevention the cdc’s current practice is not to separate mtf tg and ts people from the msm category with no attention paid to the risks of ftm tg people. a noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay. the mstgw article speaks against applying labels such as msm and categorizing people. this would include the msm label. that the article specifically refers to these individuals as mstgw and not msm is a good indicator that tg individuals would be nonmsm. lastly the hivreleated tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as balls. these social networks include houses i.e. a guild providing a social framework for young msm and transgender persons that exist in many large u.s. cities house leader personal communication . all four also were commercial sex workers. this is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.my conclusion... i have to admit ive been viewing tg too narrowly and excluding individuals that are tg yet also msm. however that doesnt mean that ts individuals are msm... its hard to argue that a drag queen isnt msm while it is hard to argue that a postoperative mtf living a life in stealth is an msm. please feel free to alter the document to reflect this information. ,0

9215,9215,mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. i do not know anything about this topic but looking at the criticism section of the current article it appears to all be reflective of specific timeperiods and therefore belongs in the history section. a dedicated criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. though you could also look at it the other way that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.as for the draft i see there are some nice plugs for moodys that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. well... i wrote the article on history of public relations and it mentions some pr agencies that played a role in its history so this is not unprecedented. however i am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. i think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention but i would suggest an editor do some light research independently trim copyedit and rewrite it and mix it with the current criticisms section into a more balanced history. talk,0

9235,9235,in other words you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue on a different page euro in part by employment of your hamhanded authority to shut me down for a few days which you did months ago. no you were not successful. in part this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue they were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority they didnt find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know debate. you yourself were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate too. but that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input in any way into this matter. you must admit to these people that you really werent interested in the subject you were just brought in to be a thug a torpedo to shut down the debate. you must also admit that you were stalking me on wp tell them what mechanism you used so they know what you did. the fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.the reality is remember reality? that according to the remnants of their archived webpage euro did not argue for white supremacy white separatism white nationalism or any other ism i can imagine would be relevant. the problem is political correctness rears its ugly head yet again and persons who display lessthansufficient obeisance to the fascisticleft will be shut off shut down and maybe even shut away. if you want to legitimately do anything more find people other than your cronies willing to debate the issue. i raised my question months ago and so far nobody is disputing what i asked have said they have not appeared let alone have they contradicted it. you dont have some sort of automatic default win authority at least according to wp rules. i proceeded to edit and i have done so. ,0

9245,9245,leave as dab page for now. the difficulty is that sources use the term very differently to refer to a vegan vegetarian or semivegetarian diet. there are several physicians and others selling particular plantbased diets that they say work miracles because of this or that ingredient omission or combination and very few medrscompliant sources offering definitions. there was even someone who tried to trademark the term plant strong. so i think this should remain a dab page until there are more medrs sources or it should be redirected to semivegetarianism or vegetarianism with a subsection in one of those articles. of those two options i think a dab page would be most helpful to readers. talk ,0

9248,9248,this is what hes put up on the karl rove discussion page. ill be frank. the blocking of came a bit late for my taste. however he was found to be in violation of the revert rule and to again quote the policy which ironically malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of a bright line exists on edit warring known as the threerevert rule rr. if an administrator has not acted already by this point then action is very likely especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. policy forbids edit warring generally and editors may be blocked if they edit war with or without breaching rr. i commend for taking the actions he did. the subsequent complaints malke made and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later are a matter of record on his user talk page. malke has since deleted the notifications but they are viewable in his talk page history and make interesting reading.after malkes block on august i decided i needed to take a step back. for the past ten days i have busied myself with other wikipedia subjects. i now return to this page. i suggest we talk a bit about what happened and i also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month edit by edit. it continues to seem clear to me that malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda his obsession got him in hot water with the admins. soon wikipedia policy is going to change as many here know. id welcome some reasonable discussion and renewed work on the article. on closer examination of the history pages of the main article it appears some of malkes biased edits through sheer volume are still in effect. i propose going through every edit of his see exactly what changes of his have survived and put back all relevant sourced material. once that is effected we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements. having just returned to wp from an extended absence i am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave wp more than a year ago. i recognize malkes concerns. material that is added back should strictly follow wpblp ie. it should be directly relevant to rove not defamatory and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources. malkes concerns were one thing his methods another. admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material and as the admins noted to quote directly from malkes talk page history since he has since for obvious reasons deleted all reference to his blocking an impartial administrator just did i dont know you from adam and havent so much as looked at the contents of your edits all that matters is that you broke wprr and received a short block for it if you want to be unblocked all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. == o i highly commend the admins and urge others to support their work. these admins had not been involved here previously they took firm direct action on a disruptive editor malke who was judged to be making untrue statements regarding his efforts. i again suggest we move past this period of turmoil and examine what changes were made to this article by an editor whose tactics earned him a block,0

9361,9361,youre right milo. a consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology. only that. wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. we dont ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star. we really dont care what they have to say. and of course we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology and more so than with other articles on science. i have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.even if i were pushing parapsychology i still would not try to censor the critics because that would only detract from my case the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.for stability reasons i dont think the article can take that approach. it would require constant maintenance and neverending dispute resolvements. nealparr that is why im talking about an arbcom decision. i want you to continue with what you are doing. it is great to get it stable for now with this definition of npov. in fact i doubt there will be much that is materially different when we get it straightened out. i wrote everything i wrote from the perspective i would think the article would eventually have anyway. so you know exactly how i would think it should be presented. there are only a few tweaks id make different like calling it a scientific field to begin with and possibly saying directly which types of psi scientists in the field think are real. so keep doing what youre doing ok? talk ψ contribs ,0

9381,9381,not making sense is your words it makes sense to anyone willing to understand that those language terms have been used and written throughout the centuries while azeri words are varients of persian which you compare to azeri for its legimity to stay and arabic written in azeri characters which didnt exist prior to the th century. if you would stop taking this matter as a battle and read the article its introduction and the other languages which are there and compare it with those of greece in comparaison it could be considered as the name of the country you will see that your comparaison does not work. since while the article on greece was made to become just a name given to the country from various languages the one of jerusalem has made to become one of historic name. by now you should have understood this. each time there is a controversy on your behavior you disappear the same day to come back days later to jump in the same controversy the same way when you stopped contributing during the arbitration cases to escape scrutiny for this very same behavior.,0
9382,9382,in fact rather than wait heres my complaintto whom it may concern hi. my names jim heller and im currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with jossi fresco. the background is this. i am a former follower of prem rawat a/k/a maharaji a person i believe is a nefarious cult leader. fresco on the other hand is a current follower and needless to say of a different mind altogether. for some years now ever since the advent of the internet rawat and his followers have engaged in a longstanding campaign to whitewash rawats past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history. the latest flashpoint arose just today when i tried to edit a wikipedia article of another of rawats current followers a religious studies professor in fact ron geaves who by the way just shot to flashpan infamy as the english academic who opined that the july th bombers were demonstrators not terrorists. please excuse the fact that to explain the problem in any meaningful way i have to flesh out the context somewhat. my edit concerned an academic not wikipedia article geaves had written where discussing a program rawat held in he wrote thatin november divine light mission had booked the houston astrodome a large sports stadium with a capacity of . the event had taken on millenial expectations in the u.s. with devotees announcing and advertising maharajis appearance at the stadium as a secondcoming complete with angelic and alien visitors. only attended the event and maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his american followers expectations. he spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.my emphasis here and belowin fact a widelydisseminated invitation to that same program maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the millenial expectations but fanned the flames substantially. thus he declared the program the most holy and significant event in human history and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significancea letter from guru maharaj ji bonn germany september dear premies first of all i would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. because we have realized this beautiful knowledge which is of great bliss to us all it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. for it is something they really need. in the world there is suffering hatred and dissatisfaction. that fact does not need proof. it is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. no one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. the world is looking for the perfect master to come and reveal the perfect knowledge of god. there is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the perfect masters coem to reveal this knowledge to people. we can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. as you all know millenium is being prepared for now. this festival has been organized by divine light mission each year since in the memory of the late satgurudev shri hans ji maharaji on his birthday. this year the most holy and significant event in human history will take place in america. i think that millenium is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of truth consciousness and bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. to do this i really need your help. i really need the help of all the premies in all respects physically financially and all other ways to make millenium come off. this is a festival not for you or me. it is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. i hereby invite you to this divine festival of peace millenium and request all premies to help me financially physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of truth. isnt it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this earth? blessings to you all sant ji maharaj it is clear when you contrast geaves claim with the documentary evidence that geaves bless his heart is playing the role of the typical cult apologist lying about his leader and blaming the followers the press anyone at all for the inexcusable laughable excesses of the cult. whats particularly worrying about geaves im sure you can appreciate is that as a religious studies professor hes imbued with a certain authority that,0

9436,9436,i think canis makes a good point on the first bullet of the original post in this thread. we can change the language to indicate that the data was collected in new south wales not worldwide although i dont think that this will change the meaning of the language significantly. nsw seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established so a slight change to current wording should suffice. the second and third bullets are less clear. why does it matter that the data is a few years old especially since the dates of the studies are clearly listed in the article? also if canis can support claims that rs references in the article contain mistakes he/she should post other rs references explaining these errors. finally if canis believes that i have edited incorrectly i would ask that he/she posts diffs showing my bad behavior and explaining exactly what i have done wrong. i have no bias in this matter unlike editors heavily involved in dog breeding and related fields and everything i am doing on this i article is being done to preserve the articles integrity and to improve wikipedia. thanks.,0

9480,9480,if we had an award for facepalm of the year i would give it to this edit summary which i have reverted. it now appears that if there is not enough information on the page about what the protesters have said some editors complain that we are trying to make the protesters look bad. and if someone adds what the protesters have said directly quoted and reliably sourced some editors complain that we are trying to make the protesters look bad. i want to make something very very clear the reason that sentence was added to the page was to present more content about the march itself reflecting reliably sourced material about the march itself in order that the page not be slanted towards criticism of the marchers or of their beliefs. the idea that it was motivated by a desire to make the marchers look loony is entirely a figment of the reverting editors imagination. if anyone believes that the marcher who said that sounded wrong in any way please take it up with that marcher not here. wow ,0

9492,9492,another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to rick warren and saddleback churchhi steve. i dont mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation but you might say that duty calls. the contributions list for carverm indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with saddleback church including rick warren the purpose driven life warrens book the purpose driven church also a book by warren doug fields a pastor at saddleback and richard abanes a lay minister and former staffer at saddleback. there is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the saddleback church page in carverms user space here. it is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldnt qualify as an actual article. why is it there? ill note that the username carverm bears a resemblance to the name mark carver. carver was at one time described as a top aide to megachurch pastor and best selling author rick warren. throwing mark carver and rick warren into google yields hits that ill hesitate to characterize but there are strong indications that carverm is potentially not just another editor and may be tightly connected with warren.regards. ,0

9529,9529, september utcsimon baroncohen imagevery kindly provided by simon baroncohen who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. it is nonfree but with permission for fair use.image can be resized moved cropped and upload as second image with same permissions whatever but thought id better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan. its not an orphan since simon baroncohen points at it. id really rather not have this image in asperger syndrome for reasons already discussed. this article already highlights sbcs theories too much at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already. he actually gave it for this article so lets try and see what the consensus is? there is no reason why you shouldnt get images of other eminent contemporary researchers as well to balance? other editors such as sandygeorge have complained about a lack of images in this article. delete this one and there is only one small image of asperger. zeraeph is right get more images to balance it dont just delete. getting more images of other eminent researchers would balance the article only in that it would be better to have images of ehlers frith gillberg happé klin ozonoff rogers volkmar wing etc. than having just baroncohen. but this would be changing the article in the wrong direction not to mention being a source of further disputes. asperger syndrome should focus on as not on as researchers. with the exception of asperger himself and maybe wing who were instrumental in the history of the disorder the other researchers just dont make the cut. rather than head in this direction the article would be better off stealing the images from autism. if you take a look at the images in autism all but one are far more relevant to as than this image of baroncohen is. i agree with eubulides. sbc is already overrepresented and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a whos who gallery of as researchers for those attached to this idea. i agree with eubulides and soulgany. yes we need images and there are images that could be used to illustrate as sbc isnt one of them and gives undue weight to one researchers views. his image should be used in his article where anyone curious about him can find it but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off. talk ,0
9530,9530,is wikipedia a patriarchal site? is wikipedia a patriarchal site? if it isnt may i then ask why a photo of a woman reading the quaran is constantly removed by islamists and noone bothers to do anything about it? i hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people including extremists and even terrorists. why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? they argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the quaran then perhaps the photo should be removed. even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks its his fault. heres what he said my wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the bible article and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. i personally feel that the image belongs in timur where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found but that it is inappropriate to include it in the quran article.does this sound normal to you? so if these extremists whom i dared to call talebans are offended by women then perhaps we should not have woman editors admins etc? i suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more liberal standards to wiki and enforce them with the sword ban these people please your admins removed my line where i called these extremists for talebans. how shameful heres the photo.oh no we see a couple of hands and a head with hair on it related link,0

9543,9543,toward a better description of the collapse of the slathere is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the sla.the idf according to its plan of withdrawal started handing major positions in lebanon over to the sla in the middle of may . the collapse started on may . around a dozen villages and eight sla posts in the center of the front surrendered to hezbollah. the posts were mostly manned by shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by hezbollah. hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the sla in april . the threats were most effective against the shites in the sla.antoine lahad the leader of the sla was in paris while all of this was going on. lahads departure for france at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the sla. lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the july departure of the idf. he claims to not have been aware of the handover of idf positions to the sla in may.by the end of the day the sla front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the sla positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. on the morning of may the western druze sector of the front collapsed. there were in reports of a secret deal between walid jumblatt and hezbollah that led to the collapse.this triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the sla. shortly after both israelis and some elements of the sla were moving south. the retreat was finished by the early hours of may .israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the sla.the controversy in all this is what the israelis really intended to do in may. many senior figures in the sla claim that israel announced the july departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from lebanon in may . these sla people claim that israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the lebanese could not be trusted with the information. i dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.my view is that the sla collapsed out of its own internal weakness. the sla was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. hezbollah worked on breaking off the shite and druze elements of the sla. the shite portion cut a deal first. the druze portion seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.i think most of what ive wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time may . ive put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the sla collapse.,0

9614,9614, milton friedman etc. i really dont know what ive done or said to produce the attitude youre taking. you can disagree with what i say although i personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent kleins inclusion in the friedman article and i can be mistaken as i was in my first reading of the norberg link but i dont see how you can take things much beyond that. nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal unprovoked insults with which youve decided to base this discourse. you do know im sure that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. you seem to take things fair to literally or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. i dont mean literally that people regard friedman as a god and having to explain that feels rather odd but ive decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. it is simply that a large number of economists and rightwingers regard friedman as something similiar to god infallible and above normal human standards. if its not friedman than its classical economics as a whole which is apparently beyond any external critique. that i believe explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.regarding klein you simply dont have a point here its as basic as that. it it not the place of wikipedia to judge what is right in any particular set of affairs but to record those opinions which are notable. klein is a bestselling and wellregarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of friedman is one of the most wellknown in the contemporary world. it also covers far far more than chile. that cannot be dismissed because just because friedmans supports or for example a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. as such the rights and wrongs of norbergs critique are fairly irrelevent. although it could of course be included as a counter to kleins criticism within the friedman article there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of kleins views. now i know that a lot of friedmanite/friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there laws of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isnt likewise scientificic and that presumably hold the same assumptions but most people disagree.just to keep you happy ill discuss it briefly here. it has some very good points for example norberg convincingly shows there was a freemarket trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond kleins explanations although the actual area of discussionof kleins book were the far rarer radical fundamentalist reforms of the period but more on that in a minute he convincingly argues against kleins account of events in argentina and mea culpa china his ridicule of kleins shockshockshock metaphor which i myself found unconvincing as opposed to most her narrative and arguments is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence in many cases of friedman. but his page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semiaccuracies disingenuous argument and nearfalsehoods as to make any suggestion that it proves klein wrong or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments completely ludicrous. ill just list in no propersome of them since i dont have the time to do anything much else. he says she portrays the chicago school as a place that brainwashed its students as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. this ones just basic commone sense he says kleins friedman crisis quote isnt from any important paper but a preface to capitalism and freedom the preface to the guysmost important book he defining manifesto isnt significant? tell that to friedrich engels. he says that friedman gave the same advice to the soviet union china and yugoslavia yet nobody would claim he was a communist well klein mentioned this herself not claiming he was a communist but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.his suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the chicago boys didnt have control until later on is simply false. while pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove kleins accoun,0

9616,9616,joehazelton and a humble question my humble wikiquestion is are editors even held accountable for libel or slander as in real life considering the reach and readership of wikipedia. what checks and balances are in place for rogue editor admin sophisticated in the policies but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.in reading and researching it would appear that many editors and admins are behaving contrary to the lofty goals of the wikiproject in order to forward personal or political agenda. also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating rr and npov policy if not in name but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?is what wikipdia critics say is true in that wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is wikipdia truly has respected place with proper review oversight or accountability for actions contrary to stated and publish policy?my experance so far with due respect would be the first rather then the later.humbly submitted and expecting the gods to block me do to my question of what is right or wrong. in closing be warned that if a thing is abuse so much and hurts to many people truly hurts them then there will be back lash and a noble project will die.,0

9641,9641,do you have any sources to suggest what these buddhist actually call themselves? they call themselves dalits for all i know.i have the vociferous complaints of the editors on this very talk page who selfidentify as buddhist for one. please read the entire talk page ill be happy to provide as many diffs as you like if you choose not to. for more sources there are several websites devoted to this. while they cant be used in the article they certainly can be used to clear up this point. moreover i know my wiki conventions far better than you. it is also not wikipedias mission to serve as a pr sourcewhat i do and do not know is arguable and remains to be seen. im certainly not advocating that wikipedia or this article become a pr source either for the movement itself or for those who oppose them.firstly buddhism never died in india.i quite agree with you if the internet is any indication. ive found different buddhist groups of varying strength in a directory aimed at listing buddhist groups throughout the world on a side note i plan to contact as many of these groups as i can for a seperate matter. that was just a cursory bit of research and not aimed at that particular assertion. im sure more energtic research will reveal more.its a nonissue and the discussion should end here. statements such as these show your unwillingness to debate and discuss the issue at hand. antithetical to cardinal wiki coventionsince we have a difference of opinion i suggest that we let an admin sort it out and youre free to seek one of your own choosing if you so desire. however id like to point out that an admin blnguyen has asserted the exact same thing on this very talk page. again please read the entire talk page its much appreciated. ,0

9676,9676,otolemur from what i have gathered from your own editing you as i do strive for npov but as mentioned in that discussion above we are not wpcensored. some editors rushed to introduce multiple nazi references into the article and i object to using such analogies as disrespectful to soviet war dead but we cant make judgement calls on what to or not include based on our own sensitivities. the editor who objected is a new editor and whilst we welcome new editors by not biting them they will learn the above in good time and come to accept that this how wp operates. so having said that the chavez quote needs to be placed in its entireity as it was written as we are not wpcensored. if the word yankees remember to capitalise it offends said editor then all we as longterm editors can do is give him fair warning he is sure to see much worse if he/she sticks around and edits various articles. dialogue stalk me ,0

9680,9680,i always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. the conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle shorting out the corresponding cap isnt quite right. what really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up or down depending on whether the + or ends are connected together and stays charged so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative. the reliable source we have cited there app note from a cap manufacturer says that you dont really need the diodes because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect. i would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode but given that its only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up i can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.,0

9691,9691,well i left for two days anyway and i see no reason to dredge up a closed thread. i will say that the whole point of the thread as calton indicated was to not have to get involved in it myself and there was also really no need for an ip which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved. ips are nice to hide behind and i will bet money on the fact that its been the same person all along which is where my remarks came from. im happy to admit a mistake when i make one but this was not a mistake. i will stand behind everything i said based on the following line of reasoning a static ip is often tied to the same computer in an office mhec the ip location is not a school its a governing authority for the state schools in massachusetts so it has an office and an .edu address but not a campus of million people using a computer in the library. the chances of two different people on the same ip meaning at the same computer knowing enough of wiki internals to go poking around ani try to run for arbcom request a block for an admin and then have troll unblock requests hello is not a spurious unblock request really? is just too small for my liking. im sorry if im not going to agf that but i cannot suspend my disbelief that far and i got hammered for it. i neither expect nor require an apology but i do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread and that ips going to be a problem until someone takes care of it. ,0

9711,9711,machida returned to his native brazil to face phil davis on august at ufc . in a unanimous result davis defeated machida via decision. of ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of machida. davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. davis mounted significant offense as it won him the fight. espn scored for davis. many ufc shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight in favor of machida. ufc promoter sport hater and just bleed advocate dana white stated shortly after the fight that he had machida winning all three rounds and later told yahoo sports that machida definitely won and mma judging sucks. fightmetric analysis supports this showing that machida outstruck phil davis and neutralized % of davis takedown attempts with a significantly higher efficiency rating through all three rounds. espn released a similar analysis tracking each fighters activity in each category and reporting the victory for davis.theres the truth.i challenge any man woman or trans to dispute one word of it. wikilies has taken the place of a once great outlet for truth.,0

9713,9713, cumin cider this is a pun folks. cumin cider = cum inside her.this vandalism has survived over a year in the article and unfortunately a quick google search shows that it has spread into other articles that use wikipedia as their only reference. cumin tea is a real use of cumin and appears to be traditional in latino cultures especially as an aid in inducing pregnancy. but the process of seeping cumin seeds in boiling water is entirely different from the various ways of producing fruit beverages known as cider. so different that cumin cider seems more likely to be a sophomoric prank than to be a legitimate colloquialism. in absence of any valid citation the line about cumin cider should be removed.,0

9740,9740, referencing referencing on wikipedia thanks to its primitive interface is a pain. there are a couple of ways to do it one widelyused method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. the meridian hill park article has a start on references its got a heading and a {{reflist}} template so youre partways there already. there are some extant citations in the text like{{citation title=roads to diversity adams morgan heritage trail url= author=cultural tourism dc date=}} and {{cite weburl= title=meridian hill park sports and recreation locations in washington dc on city guide publisher= date= accessdate=}}. you can see that the references are framed by or and in htmllike markup. you use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. when embedded in the text theyll cause notes to appear in the references section at the bottom of the page.in the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has at the left a button that says cite. clicking it will show a dropdown menu of citation references for web news book and journal references which then leads to a form that you can fill out not all forms need to be used and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. often for book references you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference and just say smith p. and go on.my main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. a certain dryness is called for but theres an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. its an interesting exercise. perhaps not joe friday more like bill gannon. have a look at the citations policy for more also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. the policies on no original research is important since wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.im certain youll have more questions please feel free to ask. talk ,0

9763,9763,hmmm maybe it needs to be made more clear. it is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. i thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. it is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic. like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess not quite the same as stimulants dont cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift? thing is how do we reword it so other people understand. thank you for pointing this out mattisse.  t? ,0

9793,9793,thanks for that link showing that the new version is far far better sourced than the old... to easily and properly support her meeting wpentand wpanybio when the earlier essentially unsourced version did not. had this new version been the one looked at by sandstein back in i do not think it would have been sent to afd in the first place. the last afds should have been sorry no consensus with the instructions that the thing needed proper sourcing as a blp. toward the voters comments... thf makes no policybased argument pinkbull was incorrect to assert that she had not won any major awards and benjar was incorrect to imply that someone could be notable only if the gng is met. a pity that the afd did not have greater participation and worse that i did not have the time back then to improve the article sufficiently so that those three might revisit to see their concerns addressed. just wanted to let you know that i think it might survive a return. michael q. ,0
9794,9794,i believe that the article did say this or at least used to. i have not checked recently however and it might very well have been removed or hacked up since this article seems to offend so many. i do not think it is valuable for me to defend it since there are so many hindus here and only one of me and i would very quickly be overwhelmed. however in the interests of mutual understanding permit me to clarify a few things. creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of christianity i cannot speak for islam. and there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in christianitynot as many as hinduism perhaps but in the hundreds for sureall interpreted differently by different sects. this is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of christianity. and it is true that some branches of christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them but again this is only true of a small segment. the difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble. i suspect similar things might be true of islam as well.,0

9892,9892,actually the citations dont agree on the nature of the similarity. its not a good practice to single out critics in the lead section either. this proposal has not received any support in the discussion at deathtrap so i think until there is a consensus to include it in the lead it is correct to leave it out. i dont see where you are opening a dialogue actually. you are simply ignoring everyones objections. i believe i offered the idea of including the material elsewhere in the article instead of cutting it altogether so perhaps you could take my suggestion.,0

9905,9905,as i say you cant read english closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.a pointer one of many possible ones on how not to construe elementary english.i am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history unless they are practiced historians.adoes not allow you to infer and repeatedly say that the meaning is nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics nor they believe in that science.where in that sentence do i state that i am unfamiliar with population genetics and disbelieve that discipline? i am saying nothing about genetics i am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline namely historiography. peerreviewed geneticists have rs credibility as geneticists not historians as peerreviewed historians have rs competence as historians not geneticists. sometimes you have dual competence as with c.d. darlington or jits van straten but the geneticists you cite if you check the historical books in their bibliographies use dated or unreliable sources for their history and make frequent errors as many reviews have shown.byou protest my writingwhat geneticists define as jewishness in europe relates to male founder genes and call me a racist who insults jews.here you fail to understand what geneticists define as jewishness. i am not using that language the view is not therefore mine. if you have a problem with this take it up with harry ostrer whose work you keep citing or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the dna reveal a biological basis for jewishness..reflect on this. you keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. its a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my english is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor making reasonable remarks is an antisemite. ,0

9954,9954,woody allen i see that you have pointed out that you are an admin. this is good. however your handling of my edit to woody allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy. i will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin such as myself. i now understand your point about the first sentence. i just went out and found a reliable source for ronans comment in the second sentence. ronans comment is notable in hundreds of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both allen and farrow. i understand that i should not have put back in the first sentence but on the other hand your edit was wrong. yes i know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make wikipedia work better and im sure that jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make wikipedia better. you should have only removed the first sentence because it was not supported by a rs which is how it ultimately turned out. however for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article including the direct comment of ronan farrow allens only biological child. that was heavyhanded editing. the quote is notable. yes it was initially placed in the article by another editor with the support of a nonrs however it is all over the internet. it is quoted by literally hundreds of rss and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a rs to replace the nonreliable source. that would have been the correct way to handle the situation. i hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future. i fully expect to hear from you im just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative but i do expect to hear from you. let me just point out that not every edit that an admin does is perfect but of course im sure you already knew that have a good day,0

9959,9959,i do not hate columbia college i hate seeing students waste their time. heres a fact columbia college is unranked by u.s. news and world report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings. this is because it is openadmissions. theres nothing wrong with wikipedia publishing an article on this school. there is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an openadmissions art school and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. wikipedia is not a brochure. being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. in fact the fundamental problem with columbia college is related to the quality it touts its big. its big because it does not limit its enrollments. there is a reason for that. its not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. if it did it wouldnt be so expensive. it does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. now the members of its administration its pr department and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality in order to make art one needs talent. talent is by definition inborn and innate. you dont get it by acquiring skill. you dont get it by purchasing the most expensive camera or the most expensive education money can buy. youre born with it and by late adolescence if youve got it it will make itself apparent. therefore any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closedadmissions art school one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. these schools are also very expensive but its possible to get various kinds of financial aid. once in the program the talented painter photographer writer or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. that creates an entirely different atmosphere one that keeps the student on his or her toes as it were and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. you might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. its because talent does not hide itself it is apparent to experts in the field. there are two ways in which columbia covers up this fact by telling students that if theyre showing up and willing to pay big bucks then theyre talented. its easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she and its usually a he who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. the other means at columbias disposal is that for the last thirty years children have been taught that selfesteem is the most important quality they can develop. in a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of selfesteem schools have simply stopped talking about talent. they might at times call it merit but that too is a bad word. so an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the drive to succeed youll succeed. the problem what if youve get the drive to succeed but reaching down within yourself you find youve got nothing to express?if you think columbia loves you try falling behind on your tuition. good luck.,0

9963,9963,this is one of the things you wrote he will not admit when asked but off the record his biggest mistake is creating the lethal killing machine chuck norris. is that not a personal attack on chuck norris? if you can understand english and the structure of this sentence it if jeffery korus biggest mistake not an attack on chuck norris more of an admittance of something done wrong by jeffery korus. it is close to saying julius caesars biggest mistake was being killed. the structure of sentences should be paid more attention to i would think before you delete someones article that does not actually violate anything close to a personal attack.,0

9969,9969,minor league baseball players are under contract with a professional team having to be stored in lower class teams but still professional players with stats. these type of minor league stub can further knowledge of the player by fans in the seats with blackberries etc thus more webhits or team scouts. wpathlete and people of notability doesnt take into account that a player and a person of notability are two different things. a person is vague to define. a player of notability say a minor league baseball player does have stats and awards to his name sometimes and these stubs can add perfectly to what wikipedia was meant to be in the first place i have reliable references and always note the stubs accordingly.,0

9973,9973,there is no reason to treat aff and sf the same. the neutrality policy which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them” certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself i won’t do your homework for you. moreover the merits of aff and the merits of sf are two entirely separate and independent things. no amount of slamming aff – even if your charges are accurate which i doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever by itself make sf worth including. sf must stand or fall on its own merits.there are many serious strikes against including sf none of which you have even tried to address. first of all it borders on being a blog which is already an almostdecisive point against it there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as i know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages including the same one we’re fighting over. equally importantly having read parts of sf... though i do not myself agree with the characterization i can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. to be blunt its largely the chronicle of one persons persecution complex. as i said elsewhere it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. and then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if i could credit the actual content. these three points – heck any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off wikipedia.and i haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. your site simply is not notable. as far as i can honestly tell you are the only person on earth who considers it an important site. if it was worth linking to someone other than the sites owner would have done so by now or at least spoken up in favour of such. that last part at least is welldocumented wikipedia policy look it up yourself as i once again refuse to do your homework for you. i am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack it is not intended as such and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others including me it’s not even close to qualifying as one. i wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of sf being linked from that or any other wikipedia page.,0

9980,9980,if arbcom says that ill quit the project but of course thats a strawman.this isnt about appeasing edit warriors tony. for example ive never known cookiecaper to be an edit warrior like me he has an lds background but he stumbled across this and found a need for an alternate version. i didnt strongly advocate this solution here until he did the same thing to the article albiet with a fork which was obviously unacceptable. a similar solution was independently derived by a new user on penis and apparently violetriga. i believe its a more satisfying that is consensusbased solution than the status quo. luke mar utc,0
