8035~utc this sentence is an editorial opinion and the information about financing is already included. being an editorial opinion does not disqualify it per se but taking account the fact that this is an article about the worldwide company with more than years history this opinion about one specific aspect related to the company voiced by nonmainstream magazine will have undue weight. it may be relevant in some other article e.g. focused to the climate change denial financing depending the context. january ~0
8036~ question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question i dont pay much attention to that page. in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. i havent yet worked in no original research. wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i dont see how that can be objective. bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al. but ive been somewhat overloaded at work. personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob. yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note i appreciate it i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication. ive never done any such thing. or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequencesive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isnt namecalling by a long stretch. im really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me wont make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. its the internet equivalent of stoning. this is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly. putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult. ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response. and please notice like abi avi is avraham the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness i counseled against piling on. talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen. yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite. thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh~0
8037~i oppose this version as it doesnt justifiable present common usage in the international community. like it or not the united kingdom is the realm most closely assocated with elizabeth ii.~0
8038~unrelated comment a couple of questions and advice since were discussing interesting things to note i have an interesting question open for anyone not just groupuscle. if you go to a noticeboard and the consensus is against you will you agree that it is evidence in favor of the position that the articles arent biased? or will your opinion continue to be that the articles are pov? in terms of trying to reach a rational conclusion its good to answer these questions for yourself beforehand. feel free to ignore this of course or to keep the answers to yourself although im also genuinely curious about your answers. on the same token even if you dont escalate im always happy to discuss any of my edits or the articles more generally with you or anyone else. i am always open to being convinced by sufficient evidence. ~0

8061~amcom article hiearlier today i noticed that there is no article on amcom and i posted on the amnet talk page before moving it to talkamcom because although the network is called amnet the actual company is called amcom.i didnt realize until later that there was already an amcom actually amnet page that had been deleted. after reading the explanation for the deletion im not sure whether amcom really has enough notability or not. however if we do want to make an amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the companys notability.if you are still interested take a look at this article i found if you want to reply to me make sure you either reply on my talk page or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. otherwise i wont know that youve replied.welcome and good luck~0

8097~lets stop and think about how the jimbo gif thing has gone since it started and maybe those of you who are voicing that im stubborn could rethink that as an unfair characterization a admin comes here tells me that he/she was going to review my block but now wont because the jimbo animation makes him/her nauseated and that i will never be taken seriously because its there. then the same admin states after my reply that its essentially my fault that he/she didnt review the block. think about how you would react to an attitude like that. now consider the statements made by those who are obviously better at communicating what they really mean its hard for me to read the page with it there. if that had been said in the first place how would you have reacted to that instead? i know that if that had been stated to me initially i would have understood because its a reasonable statement and observation and i dont want people to have problems reading the page and had no problem removing the jimbo gif from my page. snarkily saying that the jimbo gif makes one either annoyed or nauseated and will keep others from taking me seriously is neither helpful nor clear as to the real issue is it? ~0

8102~the pira campaign that we are talking about started in a few years before bloody sunday so you can hardly say it started the whole affair in motion actually i think the whole affair was started in motion hundreds of years ago... anyway this article is not about the british army its about the pira so we need to stick to their contribution to the death / injury count. and as ive said elsewhere the pira have achieved very little else in the past odd years than kill and maim a lot of people. in ever repects by their own published aims they have failed. so although we do need to agree upon accurate figures along with the sources to back them up the information must appear in the lead for this article.~0

8115~please pardon me if its a stupid question as i havent really done a lot of work with categories in the past. but does that sort of change really need a cfd? i think that if i had found myself with a similar subcat idea i would have just gone ahead and done it or more likely thrown it at a relevant project talk page to see if there were objections. of course maybe you werent able to get consensus at the project hence the post to cfd. again sorry if this seems stupid — as i branch out into new and different tasks i just like to understand the thinking of people who are engaged with them more regularly. i find it helps me with my own decisionmaking.~0

8126~deletion of av news page just curious why the av news page is being deleted while its primary competitor antelope valley press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as av press and even more so than av town crier whose page is also allowed to be here i note.here is the contentthe av news began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in lancaster california usa. it was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in . in the av news added a website and in march much like the seatte postintelligencer the av news transitioned to a webonly publication. the av news covers the antelope valley area of los angeles county mainly the palmdale/lancaster urbanized area a us census bureau defined term and areas of north los angeles and southeastern kern counties including acton agua dulce edwards afb lake los angeles mojave quartz hill rosamond and santa clarita. the newspaper is conservative in its political stance. it is currently the official news publication of the lancaster jethawks a minor league baseball team in lancaster.historythe av news was founded by fran paolinelli in . she continues to work at the publication today. it began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at the paper conservative leaning holds strongly held views which can become controversial at times.competitors in its market are the daily news antelope valley press and the los angeles times.external linksav news official websitethe format is the same as the av press. there is less historical info that the av press because we have only been going for six years and theyve been up for decades. but still we are getting emails from people who use wiki to find out about the lancaster/palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.i also point out that the city of lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.please info me as to what more i need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.~0

8154~groupingkhoikhoi has been adding this tabthe turks of turkey can be broken down into a variety of segments and the majority of selfidentifying turks include four main groupings rumelian turks who are mostly of balkan origin anatolian turks who compose the bulk of ethnic turks found in anatolia see history section central asian turks who remain a large segment of the population that has been moving to turkey for centuries and eurasian turks from russia and the caucasus such as the tatars and azerbaijanis who have more recent ties with turkic peoples. these turks share similar languages and cultures.which is not true because according to it the large segment of the population should be from central asia but its not true. they should be included in the anatolian turks because noone in turkey has recent ties with central asia other than tatarsetc.. which are already explained below as eurasian turks. so it makes groupings.~0

8213~on the other handgreat spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. albert einstein anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. albert einstein++ t/c so braveit is fascinating this comment clearly comes from an established editor. i must say i find it disappointing to know that there is at least one editor on wikipedia who is so cowardly they cannot bring themselves to be linked to their comments. what are they afraid of i wonder? one would think that as they are too embarrassed to be linked to this post then it speaks far more about them than about majorly.  chat  maybe the editor in question is cowardly because they are privy the most private of communications and would like to continue to be. knowing majorly hell probably go sulk on his blog about this hey majorly i have some obie trice for you to listen to. bye for now ... just sock it for a while just take a step back for a while. either start a new account or use your sock for a while. it will all blow over soon enough. ~0

8226~frankly this is a waste of everybodys time. it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again full in the knowledge that you will not accept them. your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole. you have consistently failed to assume good faith and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article. you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was. yet you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy. we havent moved on significantly.if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us. wpucs is a guide an essay not policy. in any case common sense dictates that on controversial articles material is more likely to be challenged than on noncontroversial ones. this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us. the material has implications for npov. these are the facts that are relevant here. a long circular argument on talk helps noone. talk ~0

8247~minor wording issue about steamboatsim doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence from the navigation section the use of steamboats along the river beginning in ... there is a footnote to this timeline page which phrases it steamboats columbia and lot whitcomb begin regular service on the columbia river. the thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before at least to fort vancouver. the first was the beaver steamship which arrived at ft vancouver in . i thought about rewording the sentence the regular use of steamboats along the river... but that isnt quite right either because the beaver was in regular use even if its operations were not limited to the river. anyway i cant come up with a way to reword this bit especially given the existence of the footnote which does not mention the beaver. so im just mentioning it here. it is a minor point to be sure but symptomatic of an unfortunate us bias present in many history books and web pages. ~0

8251~hi again dearyes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran if green movement could change somethings probably i would change my idea but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people.and about azerbaijanis are turks or not. despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk turks of west branchoghuzstarted to come but infact it is not important when they came here. the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani and not azeri which is an invented word by persians turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang. as same as turks of turkey. you can come here and ask yourself one by one you will see. it is so irrarational to say to some one that no you r not turk you dont know who you are i know you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean. pls dont tell us who we r let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not. about aran as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era. we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep. and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan. aran was part of this big land. but the important thing is the name of land is not important here as well the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep. former aran as you called are of my race and we r same nation. you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks. you may call them whatever you want as well as their land the important thing is what they call themselves. if they change the name of their republic will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language which does not exist ok lets think azerbaijanis r not turk so what they r? azeri? ok lets call them azeri what is the next step? you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian? or not speak azeri lang.? so what is azeri lang.? where is it? can you learn it to about million people? lets thing pragmatic as well as rational. even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of years ago nor persian.also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. one was paniranist other was panturkist. some of their researches looks really funnyabout the names of turkish places and cities i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan. if you were here youll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhmagaya which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place do u know what is its official name? ahmagiyyeh the lands of stupid people all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan. most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian. my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats armenians and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays. they have their own culture music dance cuisine etc. which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk i told you history is not important than today the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk. i dont know what they want us to feel in tehranthe name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well. this word cant change to azarbaijan during history. i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe which zoroastrian persians called not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it nowi had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well. the diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know. whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life we dont have life guaranty~0

8277~if this was a legal wiki you might have a valid point. its not so you dont. why dont you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this wiki?the lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder not an accidental natural or judicially sanctioned death.i do sympathise and understand that for sinn féin and the provisional ira the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. for the selfesteem of the socalled republican movement and for the political future of sinn féin it is vital that its year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. the vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may under pressure be described as wrong. they may be accepted as mistakes. pira may acknowledge in the curiously passive language it favours that these things should not have happened. but they must never ever be called crimes. god forbid...kiwiexile at dmoz • moved here from his talk page at vintagekits request result of pira investigation why exactly do you think that the views of pira should not be fairly represented on wikipedia in reference to the presumed? death of jeanmcconville?i am rather puzzled as to why you keep excising my new section referencing the pira statement on the the abduction and killing of mrs jean mcconville in december dated july by p o’neill irish republican publicity bureau dublinis it just because you are still editing carelessly and without respect to other editors work by just hitting the revert button when you see naughty words such as murder and pira?however i must congratulate your improvement in tone if not the quality and care you take with your actual edits. keep up the improvement...kiwiexile at dmoz • ~0
8278~you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors.under wikipedia policy under the rr rule it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and/or help improve the article. there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors. that is to leave the rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page youll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion without explanation without stating their objections first without submitting their proposed changes to peer review and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreedupon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.~0

8354~i dont want to reopen the issue as the issue was never actually solved. wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic and childrens books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count. instead of just blind reverting changes id like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources. whenever a source is in question it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some peoples bias against editors who arent signed in. these changes were badly needed and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wpowns the article and others who violated wpagf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good. ~0

8420~kanes secrecy?quote from the articleif the allied campaign were to be completed in red alert the allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of red alert . it should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original tiberian dawn manual which states that nod is an african group in its origin making no mention of the soviet union whatsoever.if the instruction manual was written by gdi then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of nod were. maybe kane planted information stating that it was from africa or maybe it really was from africa and kanes attempts to drum up support in the ussr were unsuccessful. regardless it doesnt seem to conflict especially if it could be established that the manual was a gdi document and therefore biased and uninformed.... please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime. either by clicking on that hyperlink or by visiting an online dictionary. the sooner the better to be perfectly honest. as an aside the changes to the section you indirectly are proposing would translate to a classic example of original research. the sections current content is sourced through the referencing of several different publications and statements of various c development teams rendering it fully verified. ~0

8437~ive reworded the lead to try and reduce the ambiguity in the definition. hopefully this helps. the common definition of a flat tax which is mostly used to imply income taxation as oppose to consumption or a sales tax is usuall not a horizontal line in regard to average tax rate and progressivity. certainly the term of flat tax implies one rate but in practice and legislation it may be one rate % but exempts income up to a certain level so they dont count %. this is of course regarding a marginal tax rate view and when such an exemption is applied to an average tax rate it becomes a progressive tax. talk june utc~0

8504~roazir fars is the arabic version of pars the iranian name when translated to english is “the gulf of pars” and the english name “persian gulf” means exactly the same thing interestingly enough most gulfs in the world are called like the iranian name for e.g. gulf of mexico gulf of aden gulf of carpentaria gulf of the farallones gulf of maine gulf of tonkin gulf of guinea etc etc so the correct name for the persian gulf should have been “the gulf of pars” just as the iranian name is as for the azarbaijan as both versions already exist on the wiki and we are not inventing a new name i insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. the whole population of rep azerbaijan is less than % of the population of iran let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word azarbaijan like iranians do so why a vast majority should follow a small minority? it is azarbaijan and english speaking people better get used to it~0

8506~hash infotecha tag has been placed on hash infotech requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company product group service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. please read the general criteria for speedy deletion particularly item as well as the guidelines on spam. if you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising you may contest the tagging. to do this please add on the top of hash infotech and leave a note on the articles talk page explaining your position. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic as well as adding any citations from independent reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.~0

8522~what do you consider primary sources in this context? she notes the obvious homoerotic passages in rydbergs poetry and fiction which are primary sources for literary criticism. the details of rydbergs sexually troubled childhood and his uneasy relationship with women were presumably taken from his standard biographical sources. i have no idea what sources svanberg and stolpe used i cant ask them. again no other scholar has questioned the accuracy of their conclusions which seems to me to be the definition of a scholarly consensus.~0

8558~personally i think many of the disputes could be resolved if we had some consistency in what is and what isnt to be said about politicians and that is more than anything a structural issue with wikipedia that probably has also been dealt with extensively in other wikis concerning perhaps george bush. perhaps we can should be looking there for guidance as to how the community has dealt with the issue.basically what we have is one camp who wants to tar grant devine/brad wall with sourced and referenced bad stuff but goes and eliminates the sourced and referenced bad stuff written about lorne calvert and other figures in ndp administrations. and we have another camp that does the opposite and an edit war is the ultimate result.~0

8568~just dropping by i thought id leave a little feedback too. a featured picture is not always put on the main page as noted by wppotd. for example the seminude michele merkin was not used as it was found too cheesy. wikipediapicture of the day/unused notes several pictures that were not used because they depict too much gore or are of a scatological nature. a featured picture rating is essentially indicating that the community feels that the image is of high quality and high encyclopedic value. on a side note potd seems to be up to . thanks for taking up the trace pink oboe. ~0

8591~ september utcill try to take the points in turn. hope i get this format right. wpblpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. i am not sure how the section applies if you could be more clear it would be helpful. the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. by this metric so little can be used that its almost meaningless. someone stating their birthdate or the grade school they attended. but for a person saying i have a conflict with jenny smith over issue x where do we draw the line? it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing with one placing on their personal publicist website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldnt argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. one can take things too far and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. ... ~0

8618~ greek love im looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. im leaving a note here because you closed this afd where i made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. there are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp. i complain here about their coordination. other editors including and i simply cant do it any longer. i havent changed my position on the validity of the article but ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided. im done. i need to limit my time on wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. when ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it. im not asking you to do anything im just explaining why i cant keep my word as given at the afd. wow that is a no hard feelings on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. i have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world. sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore. best of luck in your future endeavors here. mailchimp im not that bothered but i think that the mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake. it did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance something that was supposed to be the original problem. the criteria specifies a credible claim of significance. wordpress pages are not reliable sources. however i would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today. talkback talk just a hunch?call it my intuition but im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does. just my cents. cheers ♠♣♥♦™№©♪♫® there are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy. if you have any evidence of socking file at wpspi. recreation of article shay carl i would like to request that the article shay carl be recreated see the deleted talkshay carl for my reasons note talkshay carl was delete because of a not notibility. well there was~0

8666~i am sorry that i dislike persistent stalkers...and i do hope that you apply controls on nocal for his past stalking and also keep a check on his future behaviour...i do realise i was intemperate in the comments...i just dont like stalkers...i have had run ins with other editors of different political persuasions. to cut down on the conflict i go around articles that are way off the beaten track unreferenced and badly written. so i am at a loss of what more i can do to keep my head down when there is a wiki stalker around... ~0
8667~where do you see dennis saying step it up? the only thing close to that is his comment here to bump it up which is clearly referring to drn the wikipediadispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall wikipedia dispute resolution process and it is very clear that userbecritical understands that dennis is talking about the wpdr process because becritical actually refers to arbitration followed by dennis mentioning wprfc/u and wikipediaarbitration. stepping it up and/or bumping it up has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you. nor do any of the other comments by dennis even suggest such a thing be done or has been done. secondly you were indeed at the brightline threshold of wprr with three clear reverts in hours had you reverted again within the next minutes yes its just that strict of a line you could have been blocked without further warning since you been warned about rr several times in the past it was very generous of dennis to warn you. you were edit warring against multiple other editors. and just a reminder that you dont have to cross the brightline threshold of wprr to be blocked for edit warrring so be more cautions and find consensus on the talk page instead.dennis is a fine admin and has been nothing but helpful and nice to you i think you should return the favor show him some good faith and stop the accusations of wrongdoing on his part. ☥ ~0

8716~well lets try again one more time.re commonsenual = wpor. regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation glantz et al. commonsensual is not or. occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete and it is regulated by various international conventions. for instance guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation and one of them refers to something quite unique. therefore we can speak about the occupation sensu stricto and occupation following an armistice. that is what i mean under commonsensual occupation and that is how a reader will understand it.re belligerent occupation i do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way however other sources majority of sources use different terminology. therefore the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. i propose to present both viewpoints you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. therefore it is your arguments that do not hold water.re malksoo please reread his works again. and since both you and i can draw different conclusions from different pieces of malksoos text below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position made specifically for us the baltic sattes were occupied in june and annexed incorporated by the ussr in august . thus both occupation and annexation did happen. the fact of annexation and that the ussr proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own not occupied changed the nature of the occupation if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. for example when moscow olympic games took place the olympic regatta took place in tallinn. this cannot be a typical occupation it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant western opinion and post restored baltic states themselves the soviet annexation remained illegal. in this sense illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudodebate. the annexation since it remained illegal did not create any extra rights to the annexing power the ussr. if the article makes that aspect clear i would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to occupation and annexation of the baltic states. in fact i would recommend such change because it takes more precisely closer to the facts into account the complex nature of the soviet rule in the baltic states.what else do you need? malksoo clearly says that in the case of the baltic states both occupation and annexation took place and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense but not in others. p.s. llegal annexation equals extended occupation. in other words we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the baltic states and i never argued against that. again what synthesis you accuse me in?re there is no bridge between the baltic and soviet/official russian positions there is no inbetween or continuum of scholarship its one or the other wrong. there is a baltic position position of different foreign states which was different from state to state and from time to time positions of scholars western baltic russian soviet positions different during ss and during perestroika and official russian position.re from glantz to malksoo a belligerent occupation. glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the wwii not in the legal aspects malskoo does not consider soviet intervention in as a military operation at all. the only aggressive step according to him was a naval blockade.re baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were colonized probably. however other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the ussr hence extensive influx of migrants. was it possible if they had a colonial status?i expect you to treat my arguments seriously. ~0

8723~i had a look at the sahabiyyeen list on arabic wikipedia. there are articles about many more individuals but most of those are very poorly sourced. but if we go through them properly i think it will be possible to at least get enough information about notability and minimal biography. but the problem is that my arabic is very very poor all i can understand on reading nearly properly is the quran. i tried google translate as well but the quality seems to be very poor. but i will try my best to do what i can to improve those articles. i used to work basically on astronomyrelated articles on malayalam wiki. i think this can be my major field of work here.i agree with your view that we need more accessible information about all these individuals. but i am not sure whether wikiipedia would be the right place for that. perhaps as you said an extension...and thanks for all your time. i can understand that you are a busy person but you have been very kind to me and have spent a lot of time discussing with me. i hope i will be able to deal with my cowikipedians in such a manner. and i will try my best to take your advice and improve these articles and their sourcing. perhaps it will help improve my arabic as well....thanks again and best wishes~0

8776~ stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments. i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information. the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here. there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain. the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group i.e. hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view. hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy. thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons. for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia. this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different. still it is dissapointing. happy trails. ~0

8780~it isnt. both arent even theories but products of simpleton invention without basis and are completely undoubtedly incorrect. i favor none. i deleted them both because afaik there are none sources at all on this issue. the house of saint vladimir is of descent from a travunian local noble house with doubtable links to the house of trpimirovic and most surely no link to the house of viseslavic. however i must object putting it as a separate line tvrtko asserted rule and his line tvrtkovic is historically considered the main line of the kotromanics. as for the trpimirovic branches i suggest following standard historical interpretation of the svetoslavic being a cadet branch whereas the other being the simple continuation of the standard trpimirovic line kresimirovic?~0

8840~danny your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again. as the wikipedia page says . . .you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets this does not provide as much information to readers but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website and none of the watchtowers multiple links no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. as for the links to quotes websites they are extremely encyclopaedic and the page has no commentary but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage rather than just a few selective quotes. they are all given their source publication date and page numbers for proof and reference. your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing. you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesnt suit your agenda not dissimilar to your religious organisation. i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months you feel the desperate need to hide accurate comprehensive dated quotes direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society? if you can give all the publications from the watchtowers website then im sure many here will be only to happy to list that link but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on . you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site merely saying its not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality and your desperate urged to manipulate the public. posted central august ~0

8856~the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treatiesbaldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections. standfordham wrote to the king on october i saw mr baldwin who in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out? said yes but not on the campbell issue but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns. he sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the governments fall. ... ... and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwins strictures based on the campbell case – at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement achieved at a conference in london on the dawes plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the russian agreement. but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion. two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—middlemas and barnes p. . ~0

8875~re project dynamic hi existence does not equate justification for the article to exist. what wikipedia is looking out for is notability through verifiability through reliable secondary thirdparty sources. in other words your product will need to be wellcovered by the media e.g. pc world the new york times or some respectable publication to be able to meet standards for inclusion on wikipedia. if you do have that please feel free to recreate the article including such sources. hope that answer your queries. best regards~0
8876~great discussion point jimbo although i dont think discussion is actually required the foundation should be able to just do this without the support of the users that are disputing the edits. in really difficult disputed issues i agree the wikimedia foundation could hire experienced editors although i wouldnt support any wikipedia connected interviewers use and pay someone totally independent independent notable reporters to interview and report on the problematic content issue and report that in a wprs source thus giving full independent closure to the dispute.~0

8908~wikipediamiscellany for deletion/userpropaniac/su hi. ive just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at mfd a couple months ago and it was deleted. tbh i dont remember what was there and i was just curious if you remembered the topic or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place. im not objecting to the deletion although im kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting and to find out that wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace i mean that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in articlespace that ive tried to delete but thats been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile. but again im not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place just wondering how it happened. thanks for any light you can shed.~0

8914~...s rantpresently we are witnessing an open war against croatian dinaric culture. croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of conservative hdz party. croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergović refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players. some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all štokavian people and their culture are serbian. however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian. dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljević is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovićs book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje . also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in dubrovnik . even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijović kočan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijović kočan gusle glasnik may p. . dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatović a daughter of famous gusle player ante. although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry. not far from dubrovnik another coastal city makarska – was also a bastion of croatian gusle music. actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players. this mediterranean area also gave birth to andrija kačić miošić th century catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond. to honour kačićs work ivan meštrović the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kačić in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument. in addition to kačić makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music. according to dr. fra karlo jurišić who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banović zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovićkudrić and culminating with the most known mate banović – trliš . as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound. olinko delorko the researcher of dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of hvar. the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. english writer maude m. holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p.this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and hinterland. matija murko the researcher of this literary/music forms had reported that during his trips through dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredečki “hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme” željeznobeč p. now lets take a look at the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc. what do they have in common? of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost extinct. why do we have so few gusle players today ? is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture ? if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre~0

8917~i also did a bit of work on putting the references in the somewhat odd format that wikipedia uses. one good rule to use is to include all the information you can title date author so that another editor can verify the information in the source. the article caught my eye because we once lived nearby. the description paragraph still seems like almost verbatim from the form and we are supposed to paraphrase into these articles. i am running out of time this afternoon but it should give you an idea if you havetime to work on it some more. the paul shoup article itself needs similar work. thanks. ~0

8956~at bat edit warring at matt joyce baseball juan encarnación terry tiffee ian kinsler craig breslow matt guerrier etc.==please dont change at bat to atbat. atbat just redirects right back to at bat anyway. i agree. i agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated. in addition pls stop edit warring at matt joyce baseball ian kinsler craig breslow etc. and add to the list matt guerrier. it is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record. there is no reason to delete it other than your penchant for disruptive edits. kindly desist. it has also been explained to you with proper citations that the plural of rbi is rbis. pls stop edit warring this point. see juan encarnación and terry tiffee. that is vandalism. run batted in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis. obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info.its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  t / c danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap. both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler either make it a subhed or take it off seriously.oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky. in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in. rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint.either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. jackal again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch. as to rbis as xlee pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseball/archiverbis. plus is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention. yet jackals reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s as though the s is incorrect. he has done the same with at bat which he insists must be hyphenated. etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits. it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits. if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits. there is enough good work he could perform instead. well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do . as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one. regarding what uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue. in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists. allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked. jargon overrides grammar. to say that a batter flied out is probably not good grammar either but its proper baseball terminology. i think this needs to be discussed at the project page assuming anyones watching that page anymore. userbaseball~0

9013~whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation. in this case organic remains was added to explain the word they. while w used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils. from the dictionary of geologic terms rd edition by bates and johnson fossil any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time. nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time. and further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.w likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this wp page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future. it is unfortunate that w were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as misunderstand and twist what they said.as much impact as w have had on creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood is now way out of date. modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood. when critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism. ~0
9014~==comment==this article is a very poor advertisement for the technological competence of the students of the department please learn how to edit wikipedia articles before trying to create an article. notice that the way to create a bulleted list is to use not indented spaces this article looks very untidy. notice that wikipedia needs independent sources to verify the notability of the department. look at other articles in the encyclopedia and copy their style. d ~0

9016~what does the admin see? i would like to know if the websense admin sees just the ip of the machine that goes to or attempts to go to a restricted site or if the admin sees the ip and the login of the user. if it only tracks the ip then those that have citrix sessions can at least try to go to whatever site they want without worrying about consequences.i would be really mad if i had websense on my home connection that i pay for however i am wise enough to realize that my employer has every right to block whatever they like. it is up to me to be wise enough to know where i can surf for what. theres no such thing as a free lunch if you want an unrestricted internet connection pay for it or hack it yourself dont disguise your lack of ambition as employer oppression.~0

9036~deleted response to comments on wikipedia talkwikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. in this particular case the discussion was started by user brad who made a personal comment about me. now i dont mind this i was more curious than offended but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talknaming conventions ships‎. you claimed that my post which you deleted was a pov inserted into a neutral notice. it may have been a pov about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable. it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting. if you are going to start censoring postings then i would suggest you do so impartially. you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice but merely removed one comment. rather than restoring impartiality this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.far better that you do not delete anyones comments. i would suggest reading wikipediano personal attacks. im not sure what deleting others posts comes under try wikipediaetiquette.~0

9039~rumination also known as omar amanat is being creative indeed about many aspects of trying to promote himself and deny facts of a family nature about himself including his religion that he may consider to get in the way of his ability to promote his business interests. when he claims that there is no reliable published source that states that he has two wives and this is slanderous if untrue he uses the phrase if untrue only because he knows he has had a wedding with sabiya amanat and a wedding with helena houdova while todate not having had a divorce from either of these two wives in any jurisdiction where the wedding ceremonies took place or where they reside.~0

9046~these fake surveys are carried out by anti modi brigades.~1
9047~first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste. one refutation is more than sufficient. second your rationales appear to be shifting. originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements. now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable. be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy. given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source. i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy. consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues. this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy. this means no specious claims. and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues. can you abide by these conditions? ~0

9055~ external links on ballet hello external links are often taken as a for further reading section and as such should complement the article adding information we could not. as for ballet terminology wikipedia has a glossary of ballet and as we are working to create free content it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. similarly we shouldnt be linking to content which we should have or which is only marginally related physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet. however if you meant to reference a section theres a different method of going about this documented at wikipediaciting sources. the links used would be contained in a ==references== section and itd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which werent. the ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite and any help you could offer would be appreciated see the talk page and wikiproject ballets article improvement page for more information on what needs doing. talk ~0

9086~even the claim of essentially segregated lives is bogus. of course lives arent % integrated since these are two different cultures with different customs and languages. but what separation exists is purely voluntary some arabs prefer to live in an arab town/village and thats understandable. most arabs send their kids to arab school so they can study in arabic. however some send their kid to a hebrew speaking school i had an arab classmate for instance whose father was a department head in the city hospital by the way. many arabs live in towns with a jewish majority and theres no law against that and no one prevents them from doing so. several cities in israel have substantially mixed populations including jerusalem haifa jaffa lod ramle beer sheva and others. theres no segregation and no separation. ~0

9149~i didnt malign anyone personally or anyones name. i mentioned the authors name a second time simply to distinguish her from the other sources she quotes in her articles. it is cliffc who pulled the quote from my much earlier and unrelated to the article post bolded bambis name then tries to find fault with me. if i wasnt a big grown up fella myself i suppose from some of the passion in the comments directed at me i might be getting close to feeling personally maligned myself i might even question the evenhandedness of the administrators comments. my sources have been questioned which is fair. i have placed a query on the reliable sources discussion to show my willingness to be introspective and open to other ideas i suggest cliffc post a similar query for the how drywall works article at that same notice board. the bambi turner article has not been provided as a reference for the article the blog and real estate website article she uses as references have also not been posted to support the content of the article. i believe astm will be a reliable source for how gypsum board assemblies are put together so i would like the wikipedia opinion of its usefulness before i refer to it in the article. ~0

9163~i asked you to ensure you were accurate because if you were wrong wpspade i would accurately call you a liar. userbullrangifer made a comment that my alleged use of unreliable sources ... doesnt exactly help your credibility. however this statement was not true at all and has no basis in reality. it was fabricated simply to damage my credibility. he says this despite the fact that i had not used any unreliable sources on the page. his poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. when asked for clarification of his accusation he produces four links. of the four two were posted after his offensive comment was made. therefore i assume he was taking about the first two links that i had already provided when he said it. the first two links both of them were from of newspaper articles from the washington post . yes both of them this person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce more reliable sources that damages his credibility not mine. im calling bullshit on everything he said. for the reasons above i am calling userbullrangifer a liar. chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy. he got his lame comment in before i posted the second two links. those links were for the associated press and government of canada but lots of other reliable places have this stuff. he didnt back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. for this reason is also a liar. thats not all. this person must be the brains of this operation. right here on this page puts forth the argument that and none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory. i think his credibility was lacking prior to his comment about me. its pretty obvious that logical thinking is lacking here too. previously ive called his position the dumbest possible argument for anything ever. ~0

9239~hmmmm are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing if so what do you recommend?my understanding is that it was constantinoples position that rome objected to which granted was at the core of justinians pentarchy but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole. even so though its not like rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. in other words it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements some of which led to temporary schisms but to my understanding justinians system even if not everybody liked it became a practical reality one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed rome further and further away.~0

9261~you resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile binksternet.for starters dating back to the original discussion back in december while the user optigan liked financialnorth he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo to which no including paulh or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. as im saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed no decision was made and the discussion ended. paulh or you did not say anything. if he wanted the photo then why didnt he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? i wouldve left it at that then but instead he and other editors remained silent. i didnt restart the discussion because i assumed that the editors simply lost interest or didnt have the time.furthermore i did not slip in as you disgustingly dishonestly facetiously say. i only added that photo because i noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in january. again no one did anything for months. you and paulh cannot claim you didnt see the change because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.again paul did not form a consensus prior to the change or continue the discussion where it had left off. once again he instead changed the photo got a consensus from binksternet. the ip editor liked the photo but quoting the editor againany of the photos in that section federal reserve band san francisco.jpg except would be fine as a replacement and even the cropped version of is better than the one currently there now. thoughts?... talkim going to replace it with and see what happens.the crux of it was that paulh made the change before even binksternet approved it or i or other editors could respond.binksternets abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. despite my reverts i at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were. paulh did not and binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. i dont see binksternet asking the ip editor in question or other editors to the sf article including optigan have their say either in this. he is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus something that at least paulh did earlier. only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me ~0

9308~the author of lotr clearly intended it to be a single book and it was sold as one concurrently with the threevolume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible. the utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books. this is in stark contrast with rowlings books which have been published sequentially separated by years in between them and are considered by everyone including the author and publisher to be separate books entirely. i agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page. i hope we can put this matter to rest now. thank you for your time.~0

9340~ some tips for making your stubs a bit better apart from your overreliance on soccerway which isnt always a wprs ive noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. typing player who plays is poor english try to put footballer who plays... or soccer player who represents... the word currently is pretty pointless too i mean they either play for the team or they dont right? also try not to say they play for bayern munich in the frauenbundesliga. put of the frauenbundesliga instead because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. these are just small suggestions but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. thanks ~0

9394~hmmm. i was actually writing a response as you sent yours. oh well. for the record my response was thisresurrecting articles is frowned upon yes. we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change to...the game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article.making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders. certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start. i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article i.e. not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works. if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan. i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same. i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though. the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as – manchester city f.c. season/spurs city or however the subpage is actually named given the / in the name.yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category. i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic. better to do it ourselves i guess.sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and...well better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed. hopefully i addressed all your points. ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak. having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in. generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy. yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play. to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup? in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it. talk ~0

9419~first of all lets use proper english. there is turkic as adjective and there is turkic people as noun in modern english. there is no turkics in english as a noun. azerbaijanis by far is the rightest terminology. if you want to emphesize the ancient periods azerbaijani still should be fine because azerbaijani is a new term for turks who used to live in old days. only azeris have lived in or near modern armenia. kars igdir which are in armenian border of turkey are all populated and used to be populated by ethnic azeris and then some kurds. there is no known fact of anatolian turks living in or near modern armenia. ~0

9431~in case it has never dawned on any of you all coats of arms are made up by someone somewhere at some point in time. that is their nature. their purpose is to serve as identifying symbols of the individuals or families who bear them. coats of arms do not fall from the heavens readymade by the hand of the almighty they have to be created by mortal men for the purposes they are designed for. in some countries the designing of such devices is heavily regulated in others such as the united states it is not. but in either case all the coats of arms in existence are created fabrications made up by someone somewhere at some point in time and born by their owners as symbols of their iidentity. ~0

9453~re your ae topic ban appealsorry but it strains credulity mine anyway to believe that you didnt realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are wellacquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save as you state here . recent article/talk page history . you havent edited the article since and you must have thousands of other articles that need improvement on your watchlist. you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard re this as you have for many articles during the past few months.in my view the a.m. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcomingness. the remainder of the appeal in which you speak of wps losses from your lack of participation thats a different story that others can think over. if you remove the a.m. section i shant contest your appeal since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesnt make much difference in the long run. but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. you could either remove that section since it hasnt been commented on there yet or strike it. if you choose not to do either i may bring it up at the ae appeal. id prefer that we keep the conversation here but if youd rather have it on my talk page thats ok by me if so ill post talkbacks.~0

9475~ my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion page....l nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear salvioyou have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period.may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az seric and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds.there is a constant undermining of the city´s greek identity i.e. whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army.the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. on the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled trnc.it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture w.r.t the city. the trnc is illegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus. this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character.this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.in the light of all of this i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self. furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory.marcobadotti talk ~0

9494~ why is the lingo/doublespeak/racist word contractors used instead of the precise english word mercenaries this is an encyclopedia not a press release.wikipedia is not supposed to be the house organ of any one government but this article uses a lingo/doublespeak/racist term that the usa uses to describe mercenaries of any country other than a predominantly caucasian political ally.wikipedia should be filtering out spin words an translating them into proper english.i suggest that contractor only be used for unarmed nonmilitary nonpolice contractors.this simple rule should apply if the term mercenary would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an african government the term mercenary should be used to describe the job or person working for a nonafrican government.end the racism. speak in plain english. this is an encyclopedia not a press release.... ~0

9498~all the sources needed are provided all you need to do is read the article...but i guess you cant read. once again you prove you are not even reading the article. every edit is backed up with the source it came from. i am not going to provide you with any details because you are merely a civillain editor and not a wikipedia staff member. you have all the info you need within the pira text edits. if a actual wikipedia staff member wants more specifics i will be happy to provide themlook you are obviously a antiira hack who is making things up to support your bias. i am neither pro not anti ira. i have no bias i merely report facts. i will be checking this page daily and will continue to submit my pira entry because it is by far the most accurate and factually supported. we can do this several times a day if you wish or you can accept the fact that mine is the superior version and just deal with it. its up to you but i will reedit on a regular basis. or we can agree to incorporate your fatcxs and mine into one article. but the three areas. the number of loyalists killed from to the number of ira victims as broken down by both janes intelligence online and the cfr.and the ira/russianmafia connection which has been documented in multiple books and newspaper sources.these three things are verifiable and will remain.~0
9499~look a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing but since you two have now discussed the rough equivalent of pages this discussion is obviously stalled. let me try to sum up what i think about this topicplease be aware that wpatt like any other wp policy isn’t written in stone and saltyboatrs extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say.every article published in foreign affairs is reviewed by other scientists which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. that should be enough to make sure wpatt isn’t a good reason to ban them.i have to agree with ultramarine if you use your interpretation of wpatt consequently there’s only a handful of wparticles that would survive the necessary massdeletion of references. what’s more i think it would be some pretty bad ones those that rely entirely on newspaper articlesfinally there really is no good reason why articles that i could use in every political science paper and any scientific article shouldn’t be enough for wikipedia. ~0

9501~words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propagandadamemk you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia.userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not.he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia.how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda.hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources.i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals.i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports.damemk i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkdamemk and usertalkejanev is not the same user. some insight into my user name ejanevthe only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev. it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev.user damemk is a separate user. probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia.it does happen that i am from canada. i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years.and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia.i am not the only user/editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles.you can watch the contributions of specialcontributions/laveol and see that more than % of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes. ~0

9571~for the record larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that universal wasnt going to go anywhere with the galactica franchise. it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on universals part to do anything with commander cain and the pegasus and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis which was built by the th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth. the film would have dealt with the search a major battle with the cylons and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth all w/o involving the galactica or the rtf other than being mentioned.the first article google shows is this one . and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although im not sure about whether theres some wikirule about referencing other miniwikis. the john larocque article on the attempt is at . hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort but seeing as how their site has a lot of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware ill quote it here to save your systemsin the spring of it was announced that glen larson was making plans to bring galactica to the silver screen. impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander larson paired with its producer todd moyer on an estimated $ million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg. the story picked up where the series left off but followed the exploits of commander cain and the battlestar pegasus made famous in the original series episode the living legend guest starring the late lloyd bridges. in the concept commander cains search for the lost battlestar galactica leads him to contemporary earth which according to the story was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar atlantis.special effects were to be handled by moyers company no prisoners dfx utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander. moyer planned to update some of galacticas ships including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkersà la the transformerswhen on planet surfaces. moreover he and larson planned to expand the galactica franchise to include an imax film a theme ride and a new line of merchandise.then as quickly as it had been announced the project vanished from the radar screen. it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues. it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar galactica were still in some dispute. in either case the project disappeared into the ethers.iirc had a page on this at one time but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared. ~0

9583~for daniel casehi daniel. the block is extremely odd. imo there is no real discussion of my activity in that an thread in connection with a siteban. jehochman whom i have some history with floated the idea of a siteban. durova who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of cirt generally badmouths me about abusive sockpuppetry etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by ryulong. i agree to it. then ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. blueboy a new admin that improperly blocked me an established editor as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom i blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. he is supported by guess who jehochman durova and athaenara whom i also have history with and whose wprfa i made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. i can provide diffs for all of this but i want to show you one thread now over at wikinews. durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin luckily takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom here. i invite a neutral admin to do the same here. i have to run now. please let me know how you would like to proceed. thanks.~0

9594~being opposed to lgbt philosophy or movement doesnt make somebody an homophobe. exactly as defending israel policies doesnt make somebody a racist or being opposed to judaism doesnt make somebody an antisemite. nb settleman from recently you have started adding material from both sides but you dont comply with npov yet anyway. you have some ideas of what is the pov of opponents to some israeli policies but when you write an article on such a topic it is not enough to google for some articles about what they say. you have to understand their arguments as well as you understand those that you share/listen daytoday and put all of them in article in order that everybody understand them. you also have to introduce their arguments fairly so that they can be understood.the big issue for you will be that on the statistical point of view you should face % of time arguments from the other side partly stronger than the ones you believe in. how will you manage this if your are proisrael and revendicate this or the right to be so on wp ?as a good start you could start by trying to understand the muslim and the palestinian point of view regarding alharam alsharif / temple mount and introducing this on the article your recently created. ~0

9597~approximately / the article is factually incorrect etcon an don in the article are factually inaccurate statements about the confederate flag esp as underlying all those statements are a fundamental and flawedunderstanding entirely of slavery in the us south.... e.g. % of white families in the us south never ever owned any slaves ever so imputing slavery as thebasis for fighting in the civil war and so too the battle flag the confederate flag has that fundamental flawed distorted view ... add to that that northernerswere almost % the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the us south and add to that that black kings chiefs were the oneswho sold into slavery all the slaves that were in the us south... and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion... and of the % of whites in south who owned slaves they have all been dead years... further add to the fact that for % of white southerners the flaghas always represented valor in battle of the approximately white southerners who died in the war... add to that the war began due to invasion by northand the % felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view slavery way below that esp as those %of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves....to distort and warp all this factual history into black mania about the battle esp of valor being a rascist symbol further massively distorted e.g. by us mediaas cnn is simply put mass hysteria with no almost no foundation in fact .... please add all this to revise the bottom / of the article which has those endless wrong factual distortions.... kareen abdulla selassie imp of ethiopia sr ...~0

9618~this man deserves another shot at becoming a federal judge given all his hard work since coming to america. those dirty democrats had no right to gripe about john roberts and sam alito being two more white guys after what they did to this man. i remember reading some complaints by those dirty democrats and liberal latino voters about bush failing nominating a hispanic to the supreme court and i thought to myself well what the hell about miguel estrada you schmucks? the man received a unanimous wellqualified rating from the american bar association and yet the democrats filibustered him. they claim he didnt provide enough information about his views but i think what really bothered them was the fact that he is a conservative hispanic. this just goes to show you what those dirty democrats really are whenever blacks and hispanics step out of line by espousing conservatism.~0

9640~first of all theres no need at all to apologise about discussing your dispute here. secondly i think it would be a good idea or actually an essential step in solving the dispute to back off from this for a few days maybe even a week. as youve been backandforthing for months already another week cant possibly hurt. youll find that walking away and editing some articles unconnected with farming or with animal welfare will help put this whole hill of beans into its true perspective. it will give us time to find other better or at least more widely acceptable images to use. after i am ready i will start a new section in article talk where we can take this matter forward and arrive at a solution we can all live with. how does that sound?~0

9689~ european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not .as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version. now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable. i contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she thinks it is the most neutral one. i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the eu. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included. i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages. ~0

9717~with all respect i dont know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around. i dont think this is the way to make people feel welcome on wikipedia. chussid should not make personal attacks but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history. any normal person in chussids position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed. indeed. and the reasons they give are totally outrageous. these same people do consider which also does not give any names or an address of the persons behind it a reliable source. because it fits in their zionist thinking pattern. jaz does not. if you ever wanted to know what jews who oppose zionism go through you are having a nice view of it right now. incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting. just because youre bothered about something does not give you the right to cross the boundaries of civility. a discussion can be heated and honest without being incivil and thats what we require here. ∇∆∇∆ ~0

9733~i was typing the response when you visited the talk page. it is the nature of wikipedia to make a choose between users and so my comments were eliminated. what i basically stated is that the material probably should not be in the article the reasoning against her nomination needs to presented in a balanced npov manner. having its own section with each point starred is not npov. also there must an attempt to provide the reasons for her nomination also that was not present. also the comments were conclusionary they did not provide the reasoning. for example the la times quote stated that she is bad. whoa thats an elementary school argument. there was no explanation on why jrb is so bad. that is not a npov presentation. so go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against jrb but provide the arguments and thinking for jrb also. and conclusionary statments just dont cut it. your contracts professor wants to hear why the contract is void he/she does not just want to hear you say the contract is void. best ~0

9766~because im a pedant like this in response to the last paraphrase from of asburys the great illusion im tempted to call npov here. asbury states that neither pussyfoot nor his associates were punished or even reprimanded further he even states that they were justified. however theres a distinct difference between whether something is moral or justified. anyway im nitpicking. heres the passage so you can judge for yourselfalthough pussyfoot johnsons political operations failed by a large margin to conform strictly to the christian principles upon which the league had been founded neither he nor others who employed similar variations were ever punished or even reprimanded. it was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the lords business anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the almighty. ~0
9767~note that in one case the conversion was incorrect before the vandalism and had been so for a while. since ft/s actually equals m id guess that the was either miscopied when originally put there else subject to earlier vandalism. but these numbers should also set off some red flags for their precision so a reliable source for that number would be especially useful.~0

9796~how this article can shinea big problem here is the lack of references. even stuff that is true needs a reference cause how is the rest of the world going to know whether someone just made it up?here are ways to combat this use information from the schools website. yes the schools website sucks but there is some info there. use information from the local newspapers the trib chron and other local publications. use information from the school newspaper yearbook and literary journal. the great thing about this is students can get things in here that otherwise would go underreported. these all have editorial oversight so they are reliable as far as wikipedia cares. unlike a students blogunbeknownst to many theres also a book all about skyline called skyline sportswriter tim keown is the author he followed around the basketball team. any skyliners interested in improving this page might go check it out at the library ~0

9808~my actions are not disruptive. why youre saying this is way over reason to explain since ive provided plenty of reliable sources i am not vandalizing and i tried to reach a resolution with the author. therefore you do not know what youre talking about. youre in danger of being reevaluated by wiki if you continue to defend a sperson who clearly is too stubborn to work with others on wiki and who deletes very reliable sources. such action speaks little about you as a wiki volunteer. i urge that you to cease defending this person for whatever personal reasons you may have and be a true wiki volunteer. otherwise ill be forced to request that wiki block you and i would not want that and neither do you.~0

9865~regrettably i have to agree about the gameplay section. it comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games using mother as an example than a proper encyclopedic entry. i wont quickfail just for this but i do want it fixed before ill pass. id prefer the section to be rewritten entirely but some glaring points followmother is presented in eight chapters with rotating playercharacters including the protagonists cowboy father the family dog an inept thief and abused monkey so is the protagonist not playable? how large is the party? why are these descriptions in quotes? it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. actually why isnt the protagonist named in this section? again i completely understand the desire to approach this from an outofuniverse perspective but only to the point where the prose doesnt trip over its own detachment.mother begins with naming the members of the playercharacters family along with questions of the players favorite food and thing and opens to a pastoral forest village soon interrupted by a forest fire and the pig mask army who impose police statelike conditions on the village. with the fires outbreak the father ventures out to protect his family twin sons lucas and claus and wife hinawa but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. they set out to take down the pig mask army. lucas the games hero does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. the game features a lighthearted plot with enemies like partying ghosts and talking rope snakes. porky a character from earthbound appears as the leader of the pig mask army and is the games main antagonist. in addition other earthbound characters such as dr. andonuts and mr. saturn also appear. why isnt this stuff in plot? the cast of characters does need to be introduced better but jamming plot details into gameplay isnt the way to do that.the second paragraph is better its more in line with what i expect from a ga gameplay section. at least its good until apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor. whats the predecessors battle system like? remember not everyone reading this has played earthbound.there is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles first of all this should start off with a however or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. the information is also lacking though why isnt there a need to grind for experience? i think of this as one of the central loveitorhateit jrpg mechanics and im curious as to how the genre might work without it. imagine reading a pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed which is unusual for a jrpg without giving a brief overview of how the pc and day care systems work thats how i feel reading this. and lets the player see their magic psi power abilities viewing your abilities probably isnt a necessary gameplay detail but why isnt there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? and do they have uses outside battle like hms rock smash secret power and softboiled do in pokémon?while mother s music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new it features similar sound effects. by completely new do you mean it isnt recycled wholesale or that the style is somehow new? also this bit probably doesnt belong in gameplay.if youre up to rewriting this which i encourage especially if youre shooting for fa id recommend a structure like the followingparagraph its a topdown jrpg theres an overworld you explore towns with your team of characters yada yada yada.paragraph there are battles theyre not random with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles is it like in pokémon colosseum where you only fight other trainers or like in dragon ball z buus fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them? this is how the battle system works this is how items work this is how experience points/leveling work again how is this the case without grinding? or is a different system used entirely?.paragraph your team consists of suchandsuch a number of characters they change with different events in the story characters do/dont return once they leave here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.stuff like items and saving can you save anywhere? work in wherever you want im not picky. september utc~0

9881~that was me. i struck it late last night my time at the end of a big edit but didnt want to start this discussion and then sign off. it shows up the synthesis nicely. eugene compared to you i know nothing about this stuff. i came here because it was mentioned at fringe theories and it looked interesting. i thought i might learn something. i have a moderate level of interest in the early church. ive read crossans essential jesus historical jesus and jesus a revolutionary biography robin lane foxs pagans and christians and the unauthorized version robert millers ed. the complete gospels annotated scholars version funk hoover jesus seminars the five gospels ian wilsons jesus the evidence a. jesus michael goulders a tale of two missions robert eisenmans james the brother of jesus and elaine pagels gnostic gospels cant lay my hands on it for the date. not very closely and a long time ago. so my knowledge is general. i am relying on you and others for the specialist information that will make this a good article. what i have brought here is a critical mind and an understanding of policy honed in editing a few medical articles where precision clarity and neutrality are crucial. when i called this article crap the other day i was judging it on those criteria. it is not clear and not neutral so i doubt its veracity as will anyone with half a mind who reads it. it is a bad article. if you want it to be good or featured i recommend you welcome me sv and the many other good editors who come here. it could be at ga in two weeks.~0

9894~my reply to the revert issue hello kailash. you asked me the reason for reverting your new upload of and let me tell as it is my duty to inform. firstly you didnt inform me that you are going to upload a new version to the existing poster and you did it. kailash you are a creator of various good articles and uploader of various images in wikipedia with respectable barn stars to your credit and a user with great goodwill and respect among fellow users. should i tell you that your act amounts to vandalism in general ? shall i tell you that even you upload in good faith it will be assumed as vandalism only ? being a honest wikipedian how many times you could have reverted edits showing vandalism ? i didnt specify this because it is a general practice and moreover it would look a bit odd that a user like you indulged in vandalism. so now i think you got your answer. hence i am going to revert back without any reason specified there. still if you revert i will remain silent as i know that you didnt understand me and you are not the same inspiring and honest wikipedian i met during the merging of eega and naan ee. regards~0

9908~ germany four entries you did not respond to my argument at all please read it more carefullythe ioc cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article as the ioc itself does not publish alltime tables and publishes only unofficial tables per single games. therefore this article is in violation with wpno original research the official source for the german national olympic committee dosb does list the olympic medals for germany from to → .there were no official country codes before only in did the ioc start to assign standardized codes. before that time the local organizing committees of each olympic games had chosen codes often in the local language resulting in a multitude of codes.at the games of and the german team was simply known as germany and the usual country code of ger was used. yet the ioc code eua is currently applied in hindsight in the ioc medal database without further explanation given. yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country the frg does. the frg federal republic of germany did not cease to exist. it was a simple code change same country same noc. no alternate nocs eua frg and ger have always had the same german national olympic committee noc recognized in same noc president willi daume – same olympic committee located in frankfurt only the codes have changed. germany is officially still called frg the federal republic of germany its the same country with the same noc since the first modern games held in only the gdr had a separate noc because it was a separate country although not recognized by germany. west germany did never exist and is nothing more than the common english name used for the federal republic of germany or frg. the enlarged federal republic of germany known simply as germany is thus the continuation of the pre federal republic of germany the very same country with the same national olympic committee since . ~0

9911~the removed paragraph slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization which happened mainly after the ausgleich compromise of . while no one now considers magyarization a positive trend for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratici have removed this paragraph not because i would necessarily disagree but because this is a speculative formulation a pov in wikipedia terminology not suitable for an encyclopaedia. if this was an undisputed topic maybe such formulations could work but since that is not the case it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data. ~0

9921~so the link was a personnal attack? how funny. and i thought it was a good critic on your contribution on this page. here without the external link just for youonly me who is arguing? you have been blocking anybody who does not agree with you on this issue. shameful and now you want to find a way to make her less portuguese than canadian. what a joke “stating that she is no more canadian than she is portuguese is misleading. she was born in canada and she lives in canada.” where are your sources for such a brilliant comment? you should apply for an award for the silliest entry on wikipedia. ” but come on lets get real here” this not an acceptable comment from an administrator who also erased information with reliable sources just to get his own way. now you decide there are different degrees of nationality being the canadian the top one. pathetic. and you say it is personal attack if i consider that you have a xenophobic view on this issue because you underestimating one nationality to emphasize the other? your own your neutrality on this issue is something inexistent “content must be written from a neutral point of view npov representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources this is nonnegotiable and expected on all articles and of all article editors” “the other two are wikipediaverifiability and wikipediano original research”.you not only erased reliable sources that say she is portuguesecanadian you also have no sources whatsoever to claim she is more canadian than portuguese if such a thing ever exists other than in your mind show the sources if you can prove it is not your own “original theory”. “the current version clearly states that she holds both nationalities.” what a lie citizenship is not the same as nationality and even nationality could have a different meaning depending of context and if what you claim was true you would not be erasing all the time that she is portuguesecanadian.~0

9951~wikipediarequestsforcomment/historyandgeographythe following rfc was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. i trust that philip gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute. rossville staten island as part of an ongoing edit war has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam. these external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed. one external link links to an article about the th anniversary of the oldest roman catholic church in staten island which is located in the neighborhood. another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. it seems to me that this philip gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for rfa is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam. id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and i have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with mr. gronowski. i will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. thank you very much for your consideration. ~0

9969~a poor start sorry. the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. first of all no common twonations table is possible patent nonsense. second i object the followingthe passage from the russian table speaking of the kievan rus. as someone suggested earlier that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between kievan rus and modern russia. this is the main disputed claim commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian usersregardless of any ukrainian military table none of them may include the red army. this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states with very formal postwwii exception but also significantly antiukrainian. for instance red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and antisoviet guerillas. creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users. for instance see earlier alexpus passage on trading the truthgiven all that id suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising. i thank you an innocent editor for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue. ~0
9970~the quotes that aminz has brought to the discussion are coming from reliable academic sources. h.s. one of the most prolific editors on antisemitismrelated topics has only brought a cadre of weasel words and uncited personal opinion i.e. but no one would... ..in general.. ..jews fared better.. all of this as worded is not even suitable for mention on wikipedia. please refrain from attacking other editors adding actual legitimate academic information with citation. ~0
9971~i noticed that someone changed the redirect to another sister article of dmk. if clearly different opinions exist on the best redirect a dab page might be a good compromise to avoid an edit war. before creating the dab i also tested a small sample of airport codes like hkg sgp ams cdg. a good proportion of them are dab pages. so the dab page seemed like a good solution here. dmk is still very new so the number of references is probably still small. that makes it only more important that it can be found easily in wp. −~0
