14004~this is outrageous. i had engaged in no edits at all. not one. i have not made an edit for several weeks. the charge of an edit war is % false. also your view of what is going on with that article is entirely one sided. i did not see any block issued against the man who repeatedly used the f word against me. nothing is done when profanity is used against a woman editor instead you block her for complaining and remove her complaints from the page. that too is outrageous. i saw only action taken against the editor on the same side of the npov dispute as myself wikid who did not engage in any edit war either nor did he say anything noteworthy about anyone else. clearly this block is aimed at those one one side of an npov dispute. now you make the npov situation worse by blocking those one one side of the npov dispute and then encouraging those on the other side of the dispute to remove what is there and start from scratch. essentially you are encouraging editors on the other side of an npov dispute to throw out all of the hard work and hundreds of hours spent researching and writing this article. now the article will be even more one sided then it is now. ~0

14015~ removed text from article youre right the history section needs serious work. i have removed it from the article because i believe it is a lot of conjecture. it certainly doesnt jive with what ive read on the subject and goes contrary to information found in referenced articles for example country dance originating in frontier towns. i would suggest that the country dance section of the folk dance article is read carefully. i would also suggest that careful citing of references in this history section will make it a lot better. what happened to the role of the dance master and of recorded music? these are both important aspects of the callers history.its a little too hitandmiss for my taste. historythe role of the dance caller or cuer came out of necessity given the origins of folk dance in america but also in various cultures throughout the world.in america you can find many examples throughout history of frontier towns where country dance originated having people with traditions and dance styles from all over the world. it was customary for people when they finished work for the day or when the week was over to relax and go to a community dance event. everyone from town came.having people however from all sorts of different cultures caused problems. people from one culture would know a certain type of music or certain steps and while there was some overlap in a few cases the different steps were very confusing to those who didnt know the dances. also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures the steps had differing names.thus the country dance caller was created out of necessity. rather than only the dances they knew from each caller someone was called upon or more often just came about in an effort to help everyone have a good time who learned the dances and steps of everyone and each town created their own list of dance steps.as towns expanded and people travelled these new callers named such because they called out what you were to do next in each dance were able to learn from each other and each others styles to the point where modernly there is a full callerlab devoted to maintaining a list of proper square dance calls integrating new calls and styles of dance and generally supporting and promoting new ideas in square dance calling as well as upandcoming callers.~0

14041~i did not have anything to do with the material being added to the article in the first place i was merely reverting the removal of sourced material. after that things escalated. i read the argument made on the talk page was not swayed by it and honestly believed he was trying to remove the material because he simply did not like it. the majority of those commenting on the talk page disagreed with his argument. furthermore daily kos was not the only source quoted so the argument that it was inadequate on its own seemed to be beside the point. the allegation that i was intentionally editwarring and pushing false information with inadequate sources is not quite accurate. i was reverting what seemed to me to be deletion of valid material that other editors had defended.all of this aside losing my temper as i have already stated was unjustified and i regret it. thefortyfive ~0

14052~some small fixesi have tried to give the article some balance. bacque was actually an accomplished writer in canada before other losses but it is important to point out other losses was his first foray into history.i think its important to point out bacque is talking about losses among german pows held by the western allies. certainly hundreds of thousands and perhaps more that a million german pows died in allied custody if the soviet union is included among the allies. as well tens of thousands of german civilians died in soviet forcedlabour crews.bacque does make a contribution albeit flawed to the historiography one that has been built upon recently by anthony beevor and others who have looked at the immediate postwar period the state of europe before the marshall plan the european reconstruction period the founding of the ecsc and the beginning of the cold war.i am not familiar enough with bacques books especially the second one to accurately describe them. i think someone who has read them carefully should at least give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.i dont know why holocaust deniers would embrace bacques work since any neglect of germans held as pows by the western allies does not negate the genocide against the jews and other nazi victims.as for the plagiarisms committed by ambrose they are not relevant to this discussion.~0

14083~“mark the cousin a·ne·psi·os′ of barnabas.” ac col in luke the greek words syg·ge·non′ relatives such as cousins and a·del·phon′ brothers both occur showing that the terms are not used loosely or indiscriminately in the greek scriptures. matthew notice the word until indicates mary did not remain a virgin her whole life. some haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth. thought the gospels several times point fact. however scholars have noted two things about the theories that mary borne no other children one there is a motivate behind such theories to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later the church teaching that mary remained a virigin throught her life. two the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers sons of joseph by a earlier marriage. this notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of david another theory is that were actually cousins of jesus although the greek scriptures use distinct words for brother cousin and relative. thus scholar frank e. gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of mary and joseph they were brothers of jesus on his mother’s side.matt. jerusalem bible “when jesus had finished these parables he left the district and coming to his home town he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said ‘where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? this is the carpenter’s son surely? is not his mother the woman called mary and his brothers greek a•del•phoi´ james and joseph and simon and jude? his sisters greek a•del•phai´ too are they not all here with us?’” on the basis of this text would you conclude that jesus was mary’s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters?the new catholic encyclopedia vol. ix p. admits regarding the greek words a•del•phoi´ and a•del•phai´ used at matthew that these “have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the greekspeaking world of the evangelist’s time and would naturally be taken by his greek reader in this sense. toward the end of the th century c. helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to mary other children besides jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families. st. jerome motivated by the church’s traditional faith in mary’s perpetual virginity wrote a tract against helvidius a.d. in which he developed an explanation . . . that is still in vogue among catholic scholars.”mark jb “his mother and brothers now arrived and standing outside sent in a message asking for him. a crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him ‘your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you’. he replied ‘who are my mother and my brothers?’ and looking round at those sitting in a circle about him he said ‘here are my mother and my brothers. anyone who does the will of god that person is my brother and sister and mother.’” here a clear distinction is drawn between jesus’ natural brothers and his spiritual brothers his disciples. no one claims that the reference to jesus’ mother means anything different from what it says. is it consistent then to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins? when what is meant is not brothers but relatives a different greek word syg•ge•non´ is used as at luke .~0

14111~ im not % sure what the practice is on sorting subcategories within their parent category. i just checked and i noticed that categoryhistoric districts in massachusetts has the pipe character and then districts after it so it sorts into districts when youre browsing by letter. that means you have to go to the third or fourth page or go to the d listings to see the historic district subcategory. that sort of makes sense but it still doesnt get it listed on the first page. the reason i created the subcategory for houses is because there are over entries in categorynational register of historic places in massachusetts which is absolutely huge. im using wikipediaautowikibrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory so thatll organize them somewhat better. eventually im hoping to set up the infobox generator to check the historic function of the property so if the function is listed as single dwelling code a itll automatically put the property into the houses category. speaking of the infobox generator i finally had time to implement two of the changes you suggested. i fixed the bug where seconds of latitude were being listed as and i added the coordparameters = regionustypelandmark parameter. i havent done the lastnamefirst suggestion yet. i was hoping to find a way to automatically try to reverse the name to try looking for the last name first but i havent fully figured this out yet. elkspeak ~0

14122~support but change disambiguation if i can interject id like to add that i can see good arguments raised by both sides in this discussion from what i have read so far. the current title used has a natural disambiguation which is always preferable in an article name and obeys wptitle and wpnatural. i dont wish to make a statement without any evidence to support it but where i come from everyone knows what the term islamic state of iraq and the levant means and what it represents so its not unpopular. the acronym isil is also accurate enough to represent the group. that being said i have started to notice that both these terms are being displaced by isis islamic state and is in publications that i read and news that i tune in to. many reliable sources are also starting to refer to it as islamic state with many many different variants. the other fact that also should be considered here is the actual wording in the name. islamic state of iraq and the levant makes the group sound as if it is geographically locked in these two regions with no territory or ambition to spread outside of its primary spheres of influence. similar to the talibancontrolled islamic emirate of afghanistan. and dare i say it also makes them sound more legitimate as a group then just the ambiguous islamic state designation due to the emphasis placed upon the areas of iraq and the levant. makes it sound more formal. but it is now not the case. as multiple editors have stated it is not merely a parochial militant group with territory in the regions of iraq syria and now even parts of lebanon but a transnational entity bent on expansion. i cannot see how relegating it to two geographic positions is the mature thing to do in an encyclopedia whatever the intention. it is becuase of this that i do not believe the current name and its disambiguation is viable anymore purely for this reason. some editors had stated the potential and very real problem of justifying islamic state of iraq and the levant territory outside of iraq and the levant. its not a recognized entity as far as i know. you cannot liken it to the russian federation having territory outside of russia in europe e.g kaliningrad or the united states having territory outside of north america e.g hawaii. what i am getting at is that this implies a level of legitimate ownership and this group doesnt have it. not in libya or yemen or iraq or syria or anywhere.the issue i have with islamic state is is the disambiguation which whilst being a widely used acronym for the group can not be measured accurately to satisfy wpcommoname through google searches alone. even though many sources use is which has been stated on its own as a disambiguation it is simply too generic. a similar issue arises with the term islamic state. however were you to isolate the period for a search the results would become more accurate and this has already been stated. if a more appropriate disambiguation were to be found that could in concise terms explain what the article is about i would support it. i suggest something along the lines of islamic state organisation or islamic state isis or islamic state group or islamic state militant group. i am under the impression that wpofficial and wpcommoname are the important policies here as editor stated and in my opinion the current title doesnt satisfy either whilst a proposed title has the potential to satisfy both. the only reason why i choose to support this current proposal is that progress towards a better article name will emerge allot quicker were it islamic state is vs. a proposed alternative rather than the current title vs. a proposed alternative. ~0

14126~fair use rationale for imagefivestarbetweenthelinesthanks for uploading or contributing to imagefivestarbetweenthelines i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. suggestions on how to do so can be found here.please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template. do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box. note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. ~0

14150~please stop accusing me of what you do to me and read this however there is an endemic problem on wikipedia of giving harassment a much broader and inaccurate meaning which encompasses. also please stop dragging me back into your rehash and battleground arena every time i go away to avoid it. stop your battleground antics and allow this unbiased admin to objectively assess your conduct today. i have left all the glory of editing that article to you and your email pal long ago. also changing your edit after i had responded as you have done more than once and like you did now is inconsistent with policy. this is a verifiable fact. dont label it an attack. finally you and your email pal should read wpadminshop as it is inconsistent with policy and you should not bite a wpnewcomer just because they made an observation of your conduct. have a good night and enjoy life. is not an unbiased peacemaker in this. he is s email pal. as i stated above this is always the case. they come as a tag team and a lynch mob to drag me to their wpbattleground rather than communicate as individual editors. this is why i have decided to walk away from any and all edit conflict to avoid a potential wpew with them not even revert their edits even though they always confront my minimal number of well sourced edits. it is just not worth it. i dont have the time to list all incidents of his conduct that is inconsistent with policy but i dont need to. this unbiased admin pbs has seen through the cloud screens and has stated facts about the unjustified rfc for which in my opinion technophant has canvassed in bad faith and in sheer violation of policy wpcanvass. also his larger than life diagram here and accusations to me sound like a personal attack. i did not call him or pct names. enough wprehash and vindictiveness already. i have shown a lot of restraint today adhering to policy even after s false accusation and personal attack as stated above and as can be seen here without naming me. they should not be allowed to push me. you are not telling the truth. if i am going to be sanctioned for telling the verifiable truth so be it. also you dont need to scream at me with bold letters. i stopped using bold letters when i realized how it affected other editors. you are still doing it. the rfc/u was unwarranted and was done in complete bad faith. it was biased and there was nothing kind about it. it was a lynch mob and a bad faith pretext to call me all sort of names by a very small number of editors on the rfc talk page and no one was ever sanctioned. you wanted your own local club and your very small consensus playground in the article. you did all you could to push me away. well you succeeded and i have completely stayed away from the article even though i have exceptional knowledge in it because of you and her. you both seem to have a pattern of systematically violating policy and then say sorry and i regret the most recent being this edit that you made today for some selfserving agenda when the closing admin expressly stated no further edits should be made to this page. this is unjust selective as it is inconsistent with policy and other closed rfcs that are not edited at will by nonadmins and it has gotten way too old. i dont have time for this but i am sure that time and other editors will expose all. have a good night and try to enjoy life and let others enjoy theirs. yes pcct i remember and i remember how a biased someone who i will not include now because he has backed off wound you up enabled you and put you against me. in any case i am out of here. have a good night the both of you. enjoy life... question can you point out which one of my sentences specifically amount to wpnpa and/or wpha? once i understand it and verify the specific polic~0

14174~i like the idea of using the community districts because those are official districts of the city and do not have to be named and defined and explained and defended. i suggest adding a cds/neighborhood column to the tables and beginning to identify which is the cd for each entry. when enough are identified then split out separate listarticles. perhaps the cds having most landmarks get separate articles and smaller cds are left combined into one listarticle. anyhow i would identify the cds on this listarticle and see how many are in each before deciding on split to implement. that would be a lot of work to do but i dont see the need to rush to split either.~0

14197~ im not pretending anything and what i did is not mass deletion its replacement of pov material with reliable sources. before my latest edit the shlomo argov edit did not even make sense it couldnt since the latter half of the paragraph that completed the first one was removed and replaced by something unrelated. whats more all the material inserted by me today about israels casus belli and the uns commissions finding that israel was responsible for the massacre was there before my latest edits and only got removed possibly by povmotivated authors this month. you can see both edits were already there months ago. both edits are well sourced and after a cursory look at the editing history it can be seen whoever removed them did not give an explanation for their actions. the casus belli edit has as a source david hirsts book about lebanese history. the book was widely reviewed on mainstream media and praised. it sits at the top of wikipedias reliable source chain. and even though this isnt required the book is excerpted to show it supports the edits content. in case anyones in doubt several other sources give support to hirsts narrative. remove it all you like i too can revert you tomorrow again. ~0

14203~i would be surprised since she told me that she put it here. i suppose it could be possible. i made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site. it seems my judgement that the site is largely based on nikkis personal experiences and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles but at some time or another have been naturists. her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity nudism/naturists and pedophilia. her words are strong and certainly her pov. there is no backing with any research to support her point. the net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles. i agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important. but not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction. at any rate the reason we have guidelines such as wikipediaexternallinkslinksnormallytobeavoided is to give us guidance in such instances. any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research seems pretty clear to me regardless as to whether ms. craft was the original person who placed it here or not. it appears that the link was introduced by userdandelion here. i asked for rfc to help us resolve please see wikipediarequestsforcomment/society%claw%candsex~0

14205~yes of course. we know at this point that the intransigent prefers to get personal rather than to cooperate so lets hope that an administrator will intervene with the voice of reason. this categorical statement based on such a tenuous source upends the consensus of almost all scholars in the subject and should be relegated to a footnote stating a tiny minority hold this radical view rather than held as fact.~0
14206~no one in either thread so much as suggested that the content must be exactly the same least of all when its already covered in better form in the other article. and even if they did it wouldnt give you fiat to replace established material with worse or unnecessary changes which again werent supported on the sarkeesian page to begin with. as for your point on restructuring you appear to bethe one holding things up. t/c~0

14212~c new york city subway service stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the c train article. i dont know why youre going into more detail about the rs. its just a damn train. nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a mean distance between failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. besides the c train and the r car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway just in a more subtle way. all it matters is just simply saying that the rs were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. thats it. theres no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. at least in my book your edits to the c train article were either completely overopinionated unsourced or both and thus are not needed to mention. its not like you work for the mta anyway so dont speculate about railcar maintenance inspection or issues. if you dont work for the mta and therefore have no experience about the inner workings within the transit agency itself at all by all means stay silent sit back and relax.~0
14213~ july utc what i am getting at is that it appears from my observations that the your work will be mercilessly edited rule is used as a reason to revert someone elses editing of your the ruleciters work. example joe writes text. jane mercilessly edits joes text. joe offended reverts janes edits back to joes original text. jane seeing all of her work deleted objects. joe replies hey if you cant take the heat stay out of the kitchen and condescendingly points out to jane who is quite familiar with the rules btw welcome to wikipedia please read the rules particularly the one that says your work will be mercilessly edited preempting janes justification of her work by such citation which she thought was implicit anyway. there you have it. how to cite the mercilessly edited rule. ~0

14230~ re so the same goes for the person i insulted?let me help you to be just for one day unbiased it is true that there are fringe elements that do not believe in evolution. however someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world. aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs... the antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows or in the loch ness monster or ghosts or vampires or avoiding black cats or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt. ...and nonbelievers in evolution should an article on nasa have a big section on ufos and ufo abduction of farm animals? why would you think otherwise? among those with advanced training i would expect this number to be far higher.i am not going to carry on with this list. if this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous indirect manner id be glad to change to that way. it would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines like your buddy did which you didnt warn. i am a very uncivil and aggressive person so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. actually i dont give a crap what you people at wikipedia think. youre all a bunch of evolutionistic mythologists who are trying to force your lame hypotheses down the throats of those who still have the brain capacity to believe the more sensible alternative theories. thank you. ► talk ♥ contribs ♪♫ yes i realised that. quite a lengthy period of time elapsed before you did so. i hereby retract my statement. just to inform you do not remove users comments from your talk page. doing so will only confuse fellow editors. ► talk ♥ contribs ♪♫ your edits to user talkstrothraplease refrain from undoing other peoples edits repeatedly. if you continue you may be blocked from editing wikipedia. rather than reverting discuss disputed changes on the talk page. the revision you want is not going to be implemented by edit warring. thank you. ► talk ♥ contribs ♪♫ ~0

14246~i really dont care to fight anymore. i really did not care to begin with. i tried with valid sources to post the other side of it which contained perspectives that pov editors did not like. however or but that is all a distraction as my original intent for joining wikipedia got lost in all of that. my original contributions where to philosophy and the history of philosophy and to greek and byzantine as well as slavic philosophy. i created all of articles here for wikipedia based on that. allot of the original goals i had planned on mostly adding sourcing to those articles and subjects got discarded. as i got pulled into this other nonsense with other pov editors. the reason i am asking to be unblocked to go back to those articles and attempt to complete that set of tasks. the articles are no within the subject at least directly of eastern orthodox theology. so there should be no apparent conflict. if the issue of me crossing over into subjects that appear to be in that realm well then point it out and will stop. i have shown compliance and i will continue to. lovemonkey~0

14254~for a certain editorin bmw in west germany produced its first car since before the second world war. the competed with and failed in terms of performance price and engineering excellence to match the middlerange sedans made by mercedesbenz. the was a still more dismal failure. in the years that followed bmw made every mistake in the book. they launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. they suffered huge losses panicked and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an italian company isetta.these cars had some success in postimperial britain where there was no marshall plan and the suez crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. but germany in the late s was enjoying the fruits of wirtschaftswunder. the country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the bmw isetta motorcoupé known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”extract from car wars fifty years of greed treachery and skulduggery in the global marketplace by jonathan mantlebut then there was a fuel crisis and so briefly the germans bought it. what a happy happy accident.the bmw isetta. despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship bmw laid a multimillion dollar egg in the s with its isetta minicar sneeringly dubbed “das rollende ei” or “the rolling egg” the isetta’s engine was in the rear passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a dday troop carrier. in fact when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. as for safety the entire vehicle front to back was one big crumple zone.steering the isetta was difficult largely because its body was tapered towards the rear like a wedge of emmenthaler cheese. most models had only three wheels which didn’t make the car any easier to control. but the design enabled the manufacturers to have the isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.extract from what were they thinking? really bad ideas throughout history by bruce felton ~0

14282~ march utcthat wasnt an attack ad hominem that was constructive criticism. theres a difference. youre an idiot is an ad hominem attack. it is a baseless insult with no constructive intention. rubbish is an ad hominem attack. there is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work. telling fiddle they he or she has an arrogant obtuse attitude was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters. instead of posting rubbish is both an arrogant and insulting statement. it did nothing to help me create a better article or give reasons why the skk article was being deleted. rubbish is not an objective criteria. this article has already been posted debated is. of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.second you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what i posted as vandalism. my repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that i felt is important. i was more than happy to discuss the merits of the article as evidenced by my fruitless attempt to use the hangon tag. i literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification. i encourage all parties to go back and look at how this played out. there was no discussion other than threats a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox. is this really how you want to run wiki? it is after all your playground and you get to make the rules. thats fine with me. maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with. if i really wanted to be a vandal i could easily use an ip proxy to keep posting causing trouble here. there would be little that you could do about it but that is not who i am. i am an honest contributor who took exception to fiddles arrogant and insulting attitude. we can disagree on that assessment but dont expect me to get on my knees with some gee im sorry obsequiesness just so i can join the cool kids club.my advice to you is maybe you fiddle hiber might reconsider your knee jerk reactions at least assume positive intent see community heading above try a discussion that does not start with something along the lines of your work is rubbish. ~0

14287~ill limit this response to only a few more lines since your clearly and intentionally provocative insinuations cant go unanswered but ill be economical with my response. heres a link to my organizationdigital deli online. now send me links to yours. as to your other response do a whois look up on and i quite frankly dont see any reason why i even need to establish my bonafides to you or any other individual on wikipedia. if thats a prerequisite i must have missed that in all of the free and open pronouncements about wikipedia. i was directed by another editor to come to this discussion page to obtain consensus on what or what not to place on an article under consideration. if others like myself have found the dmoz intransigent in considering golden age radio as a category theyre welcome to chime in. likewise if theyve had nothing but the most helpful relationship with the dmoz old time radio group they as well are more than welcome to chime in. if others have found the three pages that nigelr questions let them chime in as well. if someone else has something to posit regarding realmedia or listen to links. this should end this thread of the issues under attack oops discussion but youll forgive my overwhelming sense it wont be.~0

14289~think of them like population charts. just because every years we have to go back and revise the population numbers for previous years doesnt mean the data is useless and we shouldnt keep population charts at all. the trend is what the charts are there to show and a bit of volatility doesnt change the trend.~0

14292~thuranx my edit was an attempt to improve a pov article. i am a scientist a neuroscientist to be specific. im not a creationist. i believe there is overwhelming support for evolution. i also believe that the science article reference in no way supports the statement made in the wiki article. tzw is correct saying that creationists use a term in a particular way for a particular purpose needs to be strongly supported by a solid reference or it violates wppov. please reread wppov and wpetiquette.~0

14305~offthecuff remarks very briefly this article still needs a huge amount of research and could stand very well to be moved to something like science and religion or scientific reactions to religion. there are many books and articles written about the intersection of science and religion including a new journal edited by nupedia religion editor munawar anees who has a ph.d. in biology. so please try to make this entry good lms~0

14310~i see your point thanks for making it clear. but the exception or living/dead issue you are talking about is not mentioned in the promophoto tag itself and i still think that your actual problem should firstly be with that tag rather than the images using it. you see there are many people complaining on your talk page saying the images uploaded by them are not easily recreatable and believing the images fit the description in the tag. you could perhaps discuss the problem on that tags talk page or on wikipediafair use if you already havent of course. perhaps a rewording of the tag could be agreed upon and prevent interpretations like mine and other complaining guys from occuring in the future. i still maintain that any publicity photo released by say a record company to be used on media for the promotion of one of their artists could also be usable here on wikipedia like they are used everywhere else and this category of images wont pose a restriction on wikipedias redistributabilty. regards ~0

14319~ updating engine and chassis info hey just another comment on your recent edits. you say you are updating the chassis info in the results tables except you arent. you are introducing information that is implicit the page is about car x so we dont need to be told that the results refer to car x unless the page also covers variants xa and xb and removing information on the cars entrant please stop. feel free to add the engine name to the engine field but removing the cars entrant field is not at all helpful. e ~0

14321~webdirectory/links you state that wikipedia is not a webdirectory. first make a point by defining what a webdirectory is then and what the function of wikipedia should be since it is an online medium. the only pro for wikipedia compared to normal printed media is that it can link to pages on the internet. mediawiki is developed with that in mind.certainly up to the point where links are needed to illustrate the writing they are teherfore necessary. what you do is simply boldly delete all links you personally dont find interesting or appropriate relating to the article. in that case you can do the exact same for about other pages in wikipedia and i sure hope you will soon find yourself asking what the hell your plan in life is. to be helpful or to annoy people? now the only thing i see you do is obstruct sharing knowledge and blocking information from the raeder by blindly deleting carefully selected and over the years collected external links. i had a life once now i have a mission i will keep on putting them all back for the innocent viewer looking for info.~0

14333~an inprint or rather in press article is not a reliable source. it has to be published and referenceable where others can get a hold of it. the errors in the abstract of the online version shows that it is obviously a prepublication version and cant count. by the way not even the toc for the april issue of caswj has been revealed so we just have your word for it that it is appearing at all.the new developments book is so new that no libraries yet have it but a look at the toc online as well as the article title it looks like it is a review article not a report of original research.so if you are hanging your hat on this references well the best that can be said is that jury is still out and ddp is still not been subjected to the judgment of the scientific community.we can revisit this when the casjw article is actually published. until then we cannot say that ddp is evidencebased much less that is accepted by the scientific community. of course you may have other evidence but you have yet to cite any. ~0
14334~ a request... just completed the latest lesson for the vc. would you proofread/edit it please?btw ive looked over your contributions again. your participation in deletion debates is good.the main objection in your rfa was lack of policy experience. the basic reasoning is that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them so if youve read the policies and guidelines that would show up in your contributions. on guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves. with policies unless it is fixing grammar or typos you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval but that becomes habit after you get used to it. so my advice is that you start proofreading the ps and see where that takes you. i see david fuchs has prepared a nomination for you. before you accept another nom you should probably get in around meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages and about edits in dispute resolution rfcs s some mediation etc. then ask ~0
14335~vorangor sub and i know it was just a vandal. thats why i said its almost a relief that it was a silly vandal. we were just imagining a disturbing but very possible scenario... wikipedia has a lonnng future ahead of it as a very wellknown planetwide resource. someday a criminal will post details of a crime challenging law enforcement and wikipedians to put the puzzle together. or perhaps a slightly cleverer criminal will post disinformation here hoping to send the cops and/or feds up an empty trail... all this is easy to imagine and if i may be so bold as to offer jimbo advice it will be best to keep wikipedia/media rather decentralized and amorphous with no real legal department to be subpoenaed for deposition or testimony. youll need a volunteer spokesperson like ms. cary bass on an ongoing basis but if you begin to present a standard corporate public face youll find yourselves incurring expenses like a corporation. and these expenses might be enough to entirely offset donations in some future year which could be disastrous. mimic the internet itself and things should be ok. ~0

14351~to follow up i am very sympathetic indeed to your project to add the names of distinguished biologists and biological educators. if youll check what i do around here youll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects. but there are some difficulties. i can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on john tyler bonner was nominated about months ago for speedy deletion as did not assert notability and fortunately rescued. about one member of the us national academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at afd a month. they all get kept but it takes work. what is needed for a successful article on a researcher isa short bio listing the birth degrees positions. a paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as importanta list of books a few major articles. when challenged i add the number of citations for the mostcited. a list of awards and honors and editorships . ive been adding grants received. if possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier after they have died. and of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. pictures as youve discovered add problems. i usually dont try. this works if the person was a full professor at a recognized research university and has an award or two from outside the university. otherwise there are problems people at nonresearch places need very solid documentation. professors of education need really solid documentation. for educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition and at least one more than the president of nabt will in general be necessary. we have so far not had very good success herevery few high school teachers have made it past afd. good luck and call on me for any help. ~0

14365~the inclusion of highaccuracy was a reluctant compromise following the suggestion by paine for fairaccuracy. my approach is to remove calculus entirely from mention given that there is no supporting evidence that it does anything remotely close to solving the paradoxes when considering the infinite orders of magnitudes below the planck length that calculus spans but which cannot be proved via experimental evidence as being at all relevant.so what proof do you have that calculus actually tracks the movement of physical things? none beyond some crude classical approximations. perhaps then the article should reflect that fact. please feel free to replace highaccuracy with low or rough or crude take your pick. from the wikipedia the burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable published source using an inline citation. as for the sentence while calculus can be used to calculate ... please delete that sentence entirely unless you can prove it is relevant to the movement of physical things through all scales of increment. close enough is not good enough for an encyclopaedia. ~0

14396~continued removal of primary references no newseventsprickguy no need to be generous. anyone who removes a primary reference from a highly technical scientific topic deserves my ire and the ire of the scientific community as well was the wiki editing community. you are no different than skepticalraptor. you did it you will have to live with it. all i am doing is getting myself banned from wikipedia editing a far less charge than what you face.~0
14397~new article hihimalayan exploreri have drafted a long article here~0
14398~ january utcalright as i said i dont care too much for this article. if zara leaves the project because a paragraph of his was removed thats his problem. but i think he is frustrated because his bona fide efforts to find a solution were ignored. thus he tried to move the scope of the article from discrimination of to a more general situation of. i dont know if thats a good idea but it is at least a valid suggestion. 𒁳 ~0

14405~wow dude you are something else. perhaps you dont remember the rules around here. this is a featured article and has already been vetted as you well know. you have been lurking on this article since it was written months ago. you remained silent during its fa candidacy. if you have a problem with it now send it to fa for review. you cant just blank the opening paragraph and remove the fa star because you feel like it. as for the nuclear espionage info it is clearly marked as background information and it was added due to requests during fac that there should be an explaination about us/china relations at the time. as for your research into an opinion i wrote on a different website over years ago i suggest you take a deep breath and rethink your actions. this is stalking plain and simple and quite frightening as well.~0
14406~my two cents. spoilers are fail.~0

14409~== re webscriptions article edits ==could you explain why you added the claim that the tor issue was resolved as well as mentioning daw as a webscriptions publisher?i can only assume this was some kind of hoax...? —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs im not active nor interested in helping this site anymore but as of the day of the posting both publishers had lists of books on webscriptions. so from my point of view consider it a with that as the accessdate= field. i may make a rare joke in content when the random circumstances align but not at the expense of a point of fact. im well over articles edited so im hardly into making things up. arnold bailey owneroperatorwebscriptions is an independent of baen businessman in the south somewhereone of the carolinas. baen is a nyc region publisher. why would you assume a businessman isnt trying to improve his sales by increasing product carried floor trade etc. // nkb ~0

14411~a tag has been placed on jack thorpe requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done because the article appears to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. if you think that you can assert the notability of the subject you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subjects notability under wikipedia guidelines.for guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies. feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. ~0

14413~ automate well if you can get a text copy of his book it isnt hard toisolate all structured components like section headings. if these are diseases thenyour work is done sed grep awk etc. if the text is unstructured you can still remove all the common words and probably isolate a list that is mostly dermatological in the latter case it may be easier to get all the pubmed hits that mention dematology and do the same technique on the abstracts. this doesnt get every disease in every paper but should get those central to each paper. ~0

14415~i agree. also just having an article listing a bunch of dates is not encyclopedic. that is e.g. for a fansite to provide which then could be quoted in a wiki article if necessary. talk~0
14416~at last to a finalityi thank you for inviting me to this msn session to discuss on placing this compromise i am rather satsified with it. while the oppossition led by this australian wikipedian grant cannot make satisfactory cases to distinguish iraqs relevance from this article and why issues on korea should be preserved. afterall the japanese acts of brutality against koreans are no more war crimes as angloaustralian brutality against aboriginal australians that continues to this day. their earliest british ancestors have settled australia by vice of terra nullius by meaning to fail to recognise the humanity of the native residents and have long mistreated the natives beyond the time of japans tyrannical grip on korea. for this i put it to youcome off it. the aboriginal people of australian did not want and dont want to be part of the commonwealth and subjects of the british crownthen by all means admit these acts of oppression against the aborigines fit within the complete defintion of your so called war crimesuserbison augustusbison augustus~0

14422~unsolicited advice hi pigsonthewingas someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on wikipedia i am worried by what i perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting vindictiveness childishness and bad faith on your part. it seems that youve lost the joy in editing wikipedia and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. what a small small man you are. grow up get a life find yourself a girl to have sex with or something because the way youve been sliding downhill is brining everyone else at this fine institution down. im here to create an encyclopedia. you seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. youre making everyone elses life harder. please stop that just go away.respectfully~0

14434~re blocked with all due respect you didnt tell me anything before i got blocked~0
14435~ .% not wrong your threats of blocking only make the situation worse. there seems to be near resolution on ani and now you fan the flames.you should be fair. one possible thing you could say would be the user did make the edits despite denial. sometimes its better to correct the mistake and move on. instead you attack me and im the one who found the wrong information.ani is for discussion. blocking someone for expressing an opinion is wrong. it disrupts nobody to read what is happening. in fact if you do block you would use some false excuse like disruptive when the other user was the disruptive one. mature administrators can resolve this easily. immature ones threaten. this is nearly resolved but please withdraw your threats. ~0
14436~yeah the simple sword of truth is pretty lethal... lets just leave it here ill serve the hours. i had no inclination to interact with you further and certainly have none now. adieu ~0
14437~im not even going to quote this section.i think there needs to be a basic question addressed why is there need for this section at all? who decides what is and what is not analysis of events? it may be best to look at time lines again for factual accuracy and to maintain clarity of how things developed over time pre trial post trial post sentencing etc. ttfn ~0

14446~moonridden common what iam saying is only the reaction to her continuous act of reverting well refereenced articles.u still have not responded to her completely baised act in artciles like bewafaiinsaaf main karoonga and sitapur ki geeta.i showed you how inspite of being well referenced she removed the informations i posted. like as far as your observation about ...the rest of the story is about whether asha gets a chance to convey her feelings for ashok how renu became a mental patient the relation between renu and ashok how ashok solves the problem and how the mystery gets unfolded. if at all there are grammatical error everyone is free to edit it. in fact everyone can improve the article. but right now people are delibrately removing the infos also iam not labeling him a superstar ....rajesh khanna was born years before and has rules from . so its not that iam claiming something. i have provided enough eveidences ...genaic keeps saying absolute nonsense statements about my edits why that you are not seeing. ~0

14448~ re you post in sphilbricks talk page hi antonytsethere is nothing wrong for me to remove the sentence and switched to become more polite as it is my goodwill gesture also for respecting sphilbricks advice. i have done nothing wrong throughout including my reasoning on the definition of plagiarism. i have calmed down before sphilbrick intervention. i have praised your contributions in hong kong soccer before his intervention. anyway lets forget about these incidents. i will try to tone down and be more polite. also i will be more sensible in discussing topics like referencing. thanks talk contribs ~0

14455~wild wolf and cuchullainyou are both wrong wild wolf you say confederate arizona was apart of union new mexico territory. this is completely false. union new mexico and confederate arizona were two seperate territories one governed by the union the other governed by the confederacy. union arizona territory did not exist until the campaigns occurred in and at the time of the mesilla and valverde engagements happened in the region of confederate arizona this is fact. whoever changed it back was seriously lazy about it although i will not explain why.cuchullain you say it should be named new mexico campaign because that is what most other people call it. well i am sorry if i dont think we should babdly name an article because most people are too stupid to realize the fighting occurred in arizona territory aswell and not just new mexico. as i said before i am changing this article back to east arizona and new mexico campaign because this title most accurately describes the location of the offensive. ~0
14456~hello re your edit of mt. hood you misspelled dan howitt name. it would be briefer to have the hours of the time in numbers rather than spelled out could you have suggested an edit in the discussion section prior to doing one? the text in the picture was fine before....~0
14457~regarding speedy deletion nomination of test article for sandbox page sorry for what i did i was playing around with my sand box when by mistake i posted the content on wiki . thank you for speedy deletion .~0
14458~ march utc well im also glad that you appear to think im admin material i hope i can rely on your support should i ever be nominated . im not quite sure if there is any point replying at length as you have obviously decided your opinion on how i stepped on the toes of the collaborative effort you hoped to achieve. i genuinely regret that and acknowledge that my actions could be seen as offensive but i know my intentions were good and i do not feel the need to apologise for proactively editing encouraging other to do so also and doing my best to stick to wikipedia policy. i really feel i cant win however as firstly im accused of ignoring fellow editors and forging my own path without acknowledging others then when i work with cesar and praise some of his edits im accused of acting like a team leader encouraging the troops and not in a good way i imagine. if proactivity and a policy of boldness is what offends you then i believe you may have the problem and not i.despite the unfounded attack below im still very keen to encourage your in put to this article but id really rather not get into anymore finger pointing with you. you may have noticed the great strides the article has made in your absence over the last few days mainly because we have been being bold and editing. if you are willing to join in then please do so. ~0

14462~placenames in kosovoplease before making or discussing changes to the names used in all kosovorelated topics review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names using english settlements.in short they ask us to reflect common english usage which will often will be a local name or one of them but not always because those are the forms our intended readership of english speakers would most easily recognize.for a number of historical reasons the english language has adopted the serbian forms. we merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage. wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the albanian names by the english language.the names will be modified only if the english usage itself changes to something else or if our current naming conventions themselves are amended to reflect local usage instead of english one. best regards ~0

14469~ditto on gan. to me the article is ready though i still intend to make some minor edits. on another front i think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands even though i disagree with heylins assessment of midjuly which he guesses at based on the fact that bob made its debut on the charts on july see shades p. . i find that ridiculous. for example biabh took six weeks from its official release on march to reach the charts may . highway got out much quicker with a onemonth lapse from its august release before charting. going back earlier another side took about six weeks to chart and freewheelin more about than three months using midjuly then means giving bob two weeks to debut which is absurd. of course the whole problem centers on what is meant by release. in this case its being used to mean distribution which was obviously delayed in bobs case. however the billboard advertisement of june gives at least three other clues to that pressing packaging and promotion. with those three in place distribution couldnt have been more than a week behind if not already in motion. ~0

14476~um i have read a great deal about this. what belongs here is a short precis of the material not anything more and the debate about most likely is far more than is warranted in this particular article which is precisely why there is so much on this talk page. bringing it down to a reasonable precis is the best course as far as i can tell. cheers and try not to condescend so overtly in the future. ~0
14477~hiyou can talk to me about editing the article correctly.you can message me at the myspace page you are already in the friend list.note one thing there is no correlation between this tribute band and christiandeath. these people simply want to hang on poor rozz s memory in order to make money. so removal from the article is correct. as my comment on discussion has suggested do other bands feature their tribute bands. keep the information real. wiki is important for teh interweb.if you are going to edit properly you can do so. leave comments at editing talkchristian death® comment in the thread of that name..~0
14478~i cant understand jeffros first objection. nowhere do i see a claim in the text that anyone other than the committee are the authors of their translation. the committee do announce explicitly that a privilege was granted to them. they are not thanking men for this. we have to adopt a scrupulously npov in quoting the donor of that privilege. it is a notable item of jehovahs belief that all the books of the bible have a single author in contrast to mainstream christianity that acknowledges a number of authors at different times. but i choose to say a heavenly author not the heavenly author to avoid getting into loaded and pov consideration of that author being unique or not. capitalising the a in author is i think a reasonable concession to the same convention of capital g for god and author is true to the source. in case you still disagree lets invite more voices to help.to jeffros second objection it is clear that jeffro takes inspired to mean divinely informed and that jeffro deduces from known dates of publication that jehovahs witnesses include their own translation nwt among the or uninspired ones. i have no argument against that logic. however it may be too near wpsyn because the jehovahs witnesses may not intend or even be aware of that arguments logic. unless someone provides an source that says explicitly that the nwt is among the uninspired translations we may not generate our own criticism this way. however the categorical claim by jehovahs witnesses about a remarkably large number of translations on which various faiths rely is notable in our survey of criticism of the nwt. can this be said better? ~0
14479~the alledged reason for the block was sigismont you still have not showed that the commandments was the only thing commanding to moses the rest of the pentatuch was also from mosesim sorry not i but the german reform rabbis said that circumcision was not ordered to moses so backing their rejection of circumcision upon the absence in the ten commandments of the one given to abraham.this is mere truth so that once again the block was of total bad faith.~0
14480~okay well this book was published before his trial and him being discredited. doesnt that make it a reliable source? its not the book he was sued for that was hitlers war published after the book being reviewed. just to make it clear im not trying to whitewash the nazis or anything and say they didnt commit war crimes obviously they did. i am just trying to make sure both sides of an academic issue are presented. ~0
14481~james shapirothanks for your comment on the discussion page. your version is better than what exists now but i still think the intent of the original article was and is gratuitous lawyer bashing as you can see from was last comment. i personally think the guy looks pretty sleazy but and a big but why is there such a desire to publicly excoriate him? do we have articles on offensive doctor advertising or doctors that had their licenses suspended? gee i can give you the name of one.... only his license was not supsended it was revoked for far worse things than shapiro was guilty of doing. ~0
14482~unbelievably biased article not fair this article is solely written and guarded by britneys stubborn and standoffish fans i do not see npov at all. they try to eliminate every negative material on britney but everyone knows what kind of person britney is and we all know the schizophrenic thngs she does. where is the information of britney being a noshow at the allure mags interview? where is the information of her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder? where is the information of britneys former bodyguard speaking out? where is the information of her being under the influence? where is the information of britney spending more time partying with paris hilton nonetheless than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? what about the fact that she was seen without underwear more than once? all of us know why britney mangled her vma performance she was seen partying in las vegas days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right source ~0
14483~alpa discucssion expansion hi simonpim the author of most of the discussion on alpa cameras.im wondering what youd like expanded. i had edited the alpa subject to include information about the japanese alpa cameras. someone else edited my text to indicate these cameras had no connection to the actual swiss alpa company. according to my information this was incorrect after citing a book i feel is reliable and waiting a week for rebuttal i corrected the main alpa page and incorporated references.im new to this so hopefully im following protocol.regardsmark~0

14488~i am back==wow it has been over a year since i have posted anything here on wikipedia and for that i am truly sorry no i am not dead nor is my lovely packard bell legend cdt supreme. i have been very busy and just have not had much time for play only work. all work and no play makes owning a computer a bit dull so i have decided to make a dedication to posting here more often to help enhance the wikipedia communitys knowledge of packard bell and what good computer systems they really are. i am getting very excited as thanksgiving is just right around the corner. normally i post every year on thanksgiving but last year i did not get the chance to do so. things will be different this year i promise that thanksgiving would have to be my very favorite holiday of all time. i just feel so thankful to have such a great family and a great computer. years later my packard bell runs just as good as the day i bought it back in september of i recently had to upgrade my internet browser from microsft internet explorer version to microsoft internet explorer version . i was having trouble as certian websites would not view correctly in microsoft internet explorer version . many of my favorite websites came out too distorted to even use correctly so i am very grateful that microsft supports up to microsoft internet explorer version . on microsoft windows as i will never upgrade my operating system microsoft internet explorer version . works much better and for that i am truly grateful people must understand that packard bell computers are the best around no questions asked i plan to continue running my packard bell legend cdt supreme until either i die or my computer dies wichever comes first. i look forward to spending more time here serving the wikipedia community and want to let everyone know that i am sorry and will make a commitment to be around more to spread the word about how good packard bell is god bless you all and may the force be with you ==~0

14493~cavalist team of sysops/users undermines wp’s reliability promoting greek nationalistic pov a well collaborated group of wp sysops and wp users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic greek pov. they intervene in any related new articles make greek pov edits edit wars reverts deletions block users merges and redirects. their main target is political articles about rebublic of macedonia turkey bulgaria albania their minorities in greece and greek history. khoikhoi sysop and future perfect at sunrise sysop recently deleted article voden inscription and protected articles as minorities in greece and bulgarian human rights in macedonia. they also redirected new articles as bulgarian minority in greece to minorities of greece bulgarians in greece to minorities in greece and tarlis incident to treaty of sevres without warning and discussion. all redirects don’t allow traces . practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and prevents recreating them under same name.list of abusers involved userkhoikhoi sysop he has been probated and unprobated userfuture perfect at sunrise sysop useraldux usertekleni usertelex usernikosilver usereuthymios userhectorian userpolitis usermiskin some of them are suspected employees of greek national intelligence service e.y.π.. other are suspected members of ultra natioanalistic organizations of greek interests.the situation has become unacceptible. check their “contributions” and act properly. userprespan~0

14498~ bridge to teribithia now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text ive checked and he or she is right there is no mention of young at imdb the films page or her own homepage. that usershelbyyoung has added this to the page on shelby young suggests strongly that shes not shelby young moreover if she were she shouldnt be editing the article on herself. mel etitis talk i havent taken a stance on the role dispute shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited and imdb doesnt list uncredited actors i believe. my comment was geared more toward usershelbyyoungs user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. this ip address shouldnt be removing that. leebo t/c imdb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification so if the real young did appear in the film it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her imdb listing heck even my kid is in the imdb and her scene only appears as an alternate ending. thats got little to do with the impersonation mike . leebo is correct imdb doesnt list uncredited actors only on special occasions in fact. see the case of owen wilson in night at the museum. no onscreen credit therefore no imdb credit. it was only after users complained that wilson had received credit in commercials his credit was added. . regarding the film page the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. its not going to list a voiceover actress.. has not been updated since so no credit after that would appear on the site and is therefore an invalid source.. many people have edited articles on themselves here. to suggest that shelbyyoung is not shelby young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. i dont know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello who claimed to be the real thing then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a then yearold. to my mind the fact that shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself and the photo which ... claims is photoshopped and what a lovely trick that would be proves shelbyyoungs identity. ... claims that the photo is a popular one that has been photoshopped. if so where is it? i see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. ispy jiust to make clear on the last point that i offered no such argument. mel etitis talk sorry bout that. it was early for me and i hadnt had my coffee yet. ispy ~0

14526~ british isles hi. thanks for your note i assure you that the detailed explanations you offered werent necessary — for somebody who doesnt live in ireland or in the uk i think i have an excellent knowledge of the region.where i differ from you is in my understanding of the word british. to my ears british isles is an ancient and unmarked to use some linguistics terminology phrase to my ears the anamalous thing is the use of the adjective british as though it were the proper adjective for the united kingdom. its not when used as such its imprecise shorthand. you call the phrase british isles victorian but of course it is much older than that and the ancient origins of all this terminology vastly predates the modern political situation even if we define modern as meaning the past millennium.the deeper question of course is whether you have a terminological objection or a geographical one— do you object merely to the phrase british isles or do you object to the whole notion that these particular islands can be considered together as a set? because see i think its pretty obvious at a geographical level far before humans arrived to hurt each others feelings that the islands can reasonably be considered a group. but once we consider them as a group we have to call them something. i dont think any alternative to british isles has much currency.i understand that for some irish people the phrase rankles but if they think that the phrase when used by people from the uk is full either of arrogance or ignorance or triumphalist glee im quite confident theyre mistaken in thinking so. certainly in the rest of the world outside those two countries british isles is a phrase used constantly and frequently by welleducated people who are fully aware of the two countries / two islands involved and who have no emotional investment in their sometimes strained history. talk ~0

14531~ re just the facts maam... hello diligent...adding well documented statements of fact that directly contradict a candidates own current official position is healthy in a free and open forum like wikipedia. like with others who are critical i dont see you being critical of editors who only make reference to unencyclopedic sources such as a candidate own controlled web page or an unreferenced list of official positions. according to your reasoning the political positions section of each candidates page might as well be a direct link to their own web site or positions list from their own hard drive.as for me i will continue to promote wikipedia as a free medium where by the lobbyests and special interests do not have a corrupting advantage over the rest of us. this is not in violation of any wiki rules and is in fact extactly what we are supposed to be encouraging in this free and open forum where the well referenced facts rule. as for you... just the facts maam ~0
14532~classification it has been hard for me to find a classification to use so i ended up using the one used by ethnologue but with slight modifications such as a southwestern subgroup and a modification of my own the uw languages. the latter is not based on any scientific or linguistic work and i merely created it because i have seen the uw oykangand language and the uw olkola language being described as sister dialects and because i wasnt able to find other classifications including them both. if somebody has a better classification it is very welcome~0

14540~bi i am not biased spamy incorrect or defiant. cnts are not required to build all space tethers only those that are as long as an earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator. there are space tethers in orbit right this very minute that are made with existing materials. even the boeing report that you have quoted says they are possible with existing materials. is there an upper limit to the length that a practical space tether can be built with existing materials? yes there is. the overall upper length limit for a nonrotating skyhook that is still economically worthwhile is probably around km. to the best of my knowledge no one has gone to the trouble of actually determining that upper limit simply because by the time we build one that long there will be better materials that will allow us to build an even longer one.a good example of this is suspension bridges. about the longest you can build a practical suspension bridge using steel cable is a tad over one mile. they have since made longer ones using carbon fiber cables. but even carbon fiber cables are not strong enough to build a suspension bridge across the strait of gibraltar. it is all a matter of degree. with current materials we can build a nonrotating skyhook up to about km in length if we push it. but we dont need to build one that long to make affordable space flight a reality. a km long nonrotating skyhook will have a lower endpoint velocity of % of orbital velocity for that altitude and an upper endpoint velocity of % of escape velocity for its altitude. such a skyhook combined with a reusable single stage suborbital launch vehicle and the orion spacecraft would give us affordable access to earth orbit and all of near earth space. space tourism asteroid mining satellite solar power stations and space colonies would all become possible with such a system.this is the truth. i dont know how to make it any clearer.~0

14575~ clarification on wikipedia naming standards hi kohikoiyou just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. i would like to remind you that wikipediaadministratorcodeofconduct wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that blockadmins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate othersto deal with your concerns though. from my tandpoint i just corrected a breach of wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. howeveryou just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a longstanding consensus between several users. do you have evidence of this consensus? i.e where exactly is it reported on wikipedia? as far as i can tell the page for naming conventions of greek and turkish named places specifically states... this wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. if you want to revive discussion regarding the subject you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.furthermore i have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for greek/turkish naming conventions in the first place? the standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader wikipedia naming standards which state...use modern english names for titles and in articles. historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers and should be used in articles with caution.im a a hotheaded newb so perhaps im missing something here. any insight would be appreciated ~0

14586~ill say. the lead sentence itself has exploded in verbosity since the fac. old chinese indonesians or indonesian chinese are indonesians of chinese – particularly han – descent who emigrated to indonesia or the former dutch east indies colony this migration was done both directly and through maritime southeast asia. current chinese indonesians previously known as the indonesian chinese are indonesian descended from various chinese ethnic groups – particularly han – descent this includes both those who immigrated to indonesia or the former dutch east indies colony. this migration was done both directly and through maritime southeast asia.  —  ~0

14590~ my perspective on the changes that need to be made re lira policy does not prohibit users whether registered or unregistered users from removing comments from their own talk pages although archiving is preferred. the removal of material from a user page is normally taken to mean that the user has read and is aware of its contents. as far as i am concerned the issues can be solved here you will find that i have outlined what changes might need to be made to the lira biography. i welcome your response and input to the points outlined within.~0
14591~article sizewparticle size means this page is way too long and takes forever to load now there already are split off pages yet at least section still go on for paras on end. a summation and a link to the main page is the point of a split so those can be cut down to size somehow. ill leave it to the page monitors to decide because this is their baby instead of fighting ~0
14592~actually i dont think its particularly enlightening at all first the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from the same person. i view that implication as an example of a strawman argument a person builds up an intentionally weak or flawed argument solely for the purposes of knocking it down. thats not particularly enlightening except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if theyve built it up specially just for that purpose.i view the matter more as an example of a commonality of selfselection consider that if youre at the top of el capitan natural rock pillar you will find generally two types of people . very rich people who can and do hire a helicopter to fly there.. very capable enthusiastic and competent rock climbers.in other words you dont find there many people who are both poor and handicapped merely because of where you happen to be. and if youre actually there chances are that you too are either rich or a very good rock climber. wikipedia is quite likely a magnet for control freaks. and others obviously. ive read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits. while i could say get a life i dont view such enthusiasm as inherently bad wrong or a problem. but i think there may very well be an association between ocdtype obsessivecompulsive disorder editing and controlfreak behavior.there are other clues that must be considered. a person who is acting out a controlfreak fantasy wants to control as much as possible. apparently wp has made it quite easy to revert to a previous edit. that ability is not necessarily bad against vandals but it implicitly encourages a kind of all or nothing reaction if a controlfreak wishes to manipulate as much and as many as possible its far easier to simply revert all of an edit rather than carefully and selectively remove only as much of a problem as actually exists. ever heard an old saying when the only tool you have is a hammer you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails. one of the most inefficient routes from the standpoint of a controlfreak is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit and the characteristics of the controlfreaks actions. a controlfreak gets his jollies most readily by undoing what others have done. the controlfreak feels explicitly or implicitly that he doesnt have to justify the status of the article before his victims edit. if the control freak must actually distinguish between proper posting and improper posting sections he becomes far less efficient at manipulating others. he must spend far more valuable in his notsohumble opinion time reading and distinguishing rather than merely reverting consider a hypothetical war between a person who is making a house of cards and another person who views it as his task to impede the first the latter person needs merely show up for a second or two every few minutes and knock down the house of cards. minutes or hours of work is gone in a moment very efficient from the standpoint of the control freak but not for his victim. worse if the control freak must first obtain a consensus something which wp ostensibly requires he is powerfully impeded from excercising his controlfreak tendencies. i am not considering here raw vandalism of course very arguably it should be easy to completely revert actual genuine vandalism. it is not surprising therefore that controlfreaks are far more likely to simply revert all of an edit quickly preventing consensus and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.thus i notice that in so far every case every driveby deletion to which i have been a victim involves a person who reverts all of my edits check and not merely a portion of them check and who does so very quickly check who prevents any sort of consensus from forming check and who doesnt bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting or the freaks abrupt erasures check. aha things are getting quite clear at least from the standpoint of the controlfreak in question. but why should a flock of others try criticize the victim and not the control freak? is it because i think theyre the same person? strawman argument noooo consider another saying birds of a feather flock together. if there were only a single controlfreak in the world nobody else would have any motivation to assist him or to help victimize his victims. but there are many controlfreaks and each understands that if one control freak gets impeded prohibited or criticized or exposed the next one could be them after all i~0
14593~well what you can do to be sure i am the author is simply go to and you can see my name as the owner of the website. morgan wright. its probably not possible for you to be certain for yourself unless you get one of jimmys cds and you will see they used this very essay on two of his recent cds and cited me as the author. if worse comes to worst you can ask jimmy himself we were back and forth for a while to make sure i got all the informaton correct in the bio. i wrote this biography mostly around and have updated it often since. jimmy is a friend of mine.~0

14599~ theyve changed the image on their page it seems. thats the site i got the image from not the information. the site does not mention where on earth the rouge watershed actually is which was my problem. if you know of a rouge watershed and it is in ontario near toronto and you know that highway runs nearby there the image is almost definitely of a clearcut in the rouge watershed near toronto. to be blunt i pulled the info about it being alberta out of my ass simply because it seemed like the most likely rouge valley that wikipedia had listed. thats it. youre probably right and you should change it. talk ~0
14600~hello i just thought id let you know that i say your article architectural science review in the new articles listthe information is presented clearly and is easy to understand. however i think the article seems to contain a few errors the article does not contain inline citations and so doesnt follow wikipedia style guidelines.it would be great if you could also improve the related article list of academic journals.~0
14601~finasteride edit hi sdyjust wondering if you would reconsider my previous edit with the more direct statistics. you mentioned you thought it would be an inappropriate synthesis of information but under the following link it seems that simple arithmetic calculations are allowed as i would expect. at the risk of being too simplistic i only used multiplication. please let me know what you think.~0

14608~i briefly looked at the articles and concur. actually to be merged would make sense. the several might make a decent article while separate they are lacking. along with some editing to correct possible direct copying such as the department handles adult felons sentenced by the courts. our felon caseload can be broken down into four categories the use of the word our suggest the information was added by an employee a person from idaho copied from another article. ~0
14609~actually weve been removing many terrorism and terrorist categories because of pov which is a concrete reason. cfdhi i noticed youve been adding the cfd tag to several categories which is fine but adding the tag doesnt add the category to wpcfd for discussion. please remember that this needs to be done also. if you need help with this just let me know ill explain how to do it. thanks ~0
14610~a consensus that the city and county would be called londonderry and the council would be called derry city council along with the airport being called city of derry airport was reached by elected representatives who sit on derry city council. there is not going to be a fairer consensus reached than that. but given that the consensus on wikipedia was voted on by a group of people of unknownalthough slightly obvious persuasion did you honestly think the outcome would be a fair representative? it seems that if i got enough people together i could pretty much change the name of anything or any place if based on consensus.~0

14643~i am using sockpuppets? who is editing the article without any real reason. bbc and guardian news articles are no reliable sources by definition. i simply copied what is written in willey blackwells book at page word for word. you accused me of deleting asatrians source and used that as excuse to edit but i never deleted this source. you even claimed some of them are of arab origin based on nothing but your own opinion no source absolutely nothing. well the admins will see what happened i am just going to wait.~0

14646~ imho activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the uml which is an omg standard not related to utrecht university definition though it may seem similar on the surface. but there are many variants of these diagrams e.g. workflow diagrams workflow nets and even some dialects of business process modeling are graphically similar the definition given here is not activity diagrams which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of omg. so moving the text to processdata diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as i initially suggested hmm took out my hatchet and did it. i think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by utrecht definition of the term and that by squatting the term some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this metamodeling technique page. but i think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. the merge was suggested as a way of providing an example provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling. to conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism i suggest we cut it from the text of this page and maybe just add a see also pointing to the other page. cheers.~0

14654~im not exactly a proisraeali sic wikipedian unless by proisraeli one means believing that israel has a right to exist but in general i would be very sparing the use of the words terrorism and terrorist. its one thing to say a calls b a terrorist thats ok but i cant think of a case where i would want to use it in the narrative voice of the article. in the case of the munich massacre i wouldnt bother fighting to remove the word nor to cite an example where the perpetrators were zionists would i in the case of the deir yassin massacre. given that we cite the un calling the sabra and shatila massacre genocidal a much stronger term than terrorist its hard to imagine what would be gained by adding that word. after all if we call the ss paramilitary it seems reasonable to use the same word for the phalangists. talk nov utc~0

14657~im just curious as to whether we have any statistics on what people who search the term lowell by itself are actually looking for. my assumption could well be wrong is that a majority of those who search lowell just that one word are looking for lowell massachusetts. it is by far the most populous and bestknown lowell in the united states. aside from several very small towns that share the name are any of the other people or places on this disambiguation page commonly referred to as just lowell? and if so does their overall notability rival that of the city in massachusetts? not trying to draw any conclusions here i just want to know whether theres any consensus or strong feelings one way or the other on the disambig and if so what support there is for one view or the other.~0
14658~ what you keep losing sight of in your quest to smooth things over is that ae was truly a worse than mediocre pilot. in your words generally i respectfully but definitely disagree with a definitions of earhart as mediocre average at best etc. pilot. it is based on few selected claims . . . for some reason you are following a popular pov that doesnt match with reality. amelia earhart crashed expensive airplanes and finally got permanently lost and died. she contributed to the death of another person. she has never been found. in aviation that surely qualifies as the worst of aviators although some here may cut her some slack since she was an attractive young woman. any article about her flight training ought properly focus on the reasons for her inadequate skill set. ~0

14664~. good morning. i appreciate your initiative in taking up the issue. this one guy ip ... and numerous other ip addresses ironically he does not reveal his actual id is trying to impose his personal opionions regarding the punjabi tribes he is not very much familiar with and does not have any sound knowledge about them. he does not know nothing about the history culture and sensitivities of these people the kamboj arains sainis etc. he belongs to some unknown tribal id and does not have the guts to show up his true ethinc affiliations or affiliations so that we can know which hell the caste or the tribal group he belongs to so that we can respond him appropriately. his version of the article is for sure lopsided with selective references caterting to his own view point. compared to this i have furnished numerous refrerences which demonstrate the broader and exhaustive view point i am trying to project. per your suggestion shortly i would take up this issue on the discussion forum of this article and would present my view point for general the information of the wiki readers. sincerely~0

14671~ your meddling immigrant confusion... i have a source here that explains the ethnic origins of american founding fathersenglish scottish irish french dutch/orangist german/holy roman coats of armsthat being said rhenish germans were the sort we had in those days. prussians and austrians as well as their politics did not constitute part of the founding fathers vision or hope of the future for america. youll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the habsburg or hohenzollern except perhaps friedrich wilhelm von steuben politics in any way were an inspiration for americans of any or all origins then and now. we have had emulation of william van oranjenassau and prince rupert of the rhine including his family such as the winter king and queen of bohemia but that is because they were rhenish and any other palatine amish etc. like herbert hoover and dwight eisenhower culture we pretty much supported always and for all times. thats different from the east german culture which has never ever been a component of americana and might never be either. try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face. you have to put the german issue in context benjamin franklin was hostile to palatine boors as he called them but the quaker establishment which founded pennsylvania loved him to death. you are looking for an inclusivity that only exists in the media including revisionist history books attempting to supplant our identity with subversive principles. ~0

14673~the question is why must i be allowed to edit posthaste rather than as the drooling imbecile below instructs me to wait it out. quite simply there are urgent questions on the reference desk that require my immediate attention. if i dont attend to them now i fear that lesser misguided and occasionally malicious editors will respond to these questions and give people the wrong answer. this may be hard for you to believe but i could barely sleep last night worrying about the tidal wave of misinformation that has engulfed the miscellaneous and humanities sections of the reference desk since i was blocked. i need to help those poor people now. the reason i was blocked had nothing to do with my sterling and awardwinning assistance at the reference desk i was blocked for my naughty but in my view entirely warranted behavior at an/i. i have already given you my word that i do not plan to mix it up at the moronic incidents board for at least a couple weeks but want only to assist my fellow man and impart my wisdom and knowledge at the reference desk as well as make minor edits to articles with mistakes them. it is urgent.also i am free all day today tuesday but tomorrow i have plans to go out for pizza and to clean my house and after that i have houseguests so i wont have much time to edit wikipedia if i wait for my block to expire. now that i have explained myself i expect you to clarify your response to my unblock request as well. please unblock me immediately. regards tfm.}}~0

14680~why korean comfort women?why korean comfort women during korean war and why korean collaborators? because it is true. it all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. so we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.from the construction of us camptown prostitution in south korea transformation and resistance by lee na young the term “comfort women” wianbu to refer to military prostitutes serving american soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. this term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to un soldiers” and terms like yanggongju western princesses or “un madams” woman getting a livelihood by serving un soldiers. this usage continued during the s and s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from nonu.s. military prostitution. the korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution which was in the decades after the war regarded as a necessary means to feed korea’s impoverished population.the chosun ilbo or daily news is major newspapers in south korea readers. examples given are in chosun ilbo august it mentions in pup’ylng some comfort women dealing with american troops. similar reports using the words comfort women are kylnghyang ilbo // chosun ilbo // chosun ilbo // chosun ilbo //. a “comfort women’s demonstration” is also reported in . in the mid to lates there were numerous articles in chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by american soldiers that continued to used the term comfort women. korea college girls recruited for the nangnang club were also viewed as yanggongju or comfort women seoul sinmun july october . postwar military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the japanese one.in the chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as . the women who served “one american husband” were called “yangbuin” western madam instead of the usual yanggalbo western whore who were generally treated by korean society as “nonhuman beings”. generally the yanggongju have been ignored in official korean histories as a national shame until recent. songgun chong in wrote socalled “comfort women” registered with the health section of the military and the military police corps of the u.s. army “current situations of korean prostitutes and countermeasures.” pophaknonchong . you can download the main reference at references also arise in yi imha. a. the korean war and gende hankuk chonjaengkwa jaendo. seoul sohaemunjip.you must educate your self.~0

14695~another episode emily and her dog here is another story about emily and her dogemily was a remarkable creature. as a child and as a woman she was in person a mere shadow of humanity — pale and delicate. but a wild unearthly spirit dwelt within her and ever and again it flashed forth through her eyes in a fashion that made beholders tremble. when a child she was bitten by a strange dog and without saying a word she went to the kitchen took a redhot italian iron from the fire and laid it on the wounded part. her pet and constant associate was a huge tawny ferocious bulldog that some eccentric friend had given her. every one in the house stood in awe of this brute it persisted in lying at full length on the clean counterpanes of the beds but no one save its mistress dared teach it better manners for it was known never to forgive a blow. emily however resolved to flog the monster. she was small slight feeble and a child in years but with whitened face and flashing eyes she seized the dog by the back of the neck and dragged it down stairs on reaching the hall she let go her hold and instantly the furious creature flew at her throat but promptly with her little clenched fist she struck it in the eye and knocked it back a quick succession of blows followed — every one of them being directed against the one or the other eye. the battery lasted for several minutes when the animal fell down stupified blinded and senseless and emily dragged off its huge carcase in triumph to foment the swollen eyes. the dog loved her with a dogs lasting slavish love ever afterwards lived obedient to her call and when she died mourned as weakly as a human creature over her grave.source john cordy jeaffreson novels and novelists from elizabeth to victoria p. published in .~0

14728~from the timesthe sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin as occurred on the ryanair flight is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. they don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about ft above sealevel the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.at the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the enroute air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. in the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.the ryanair boeing performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. the pilots descended from about ft to ft in five minutes according to the authorities at limoges airport where it landed. the media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a plunge or a free fall but the descent rate of about ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.~0
14729~thanks and ditto to you. i spend a lot of my time on npp and categorising uncategorised pages. the entire reason i joined npp in the first place was the number of dross articles that made their way through and i then had to deal with so on behalf of the entire uncategorised pages taskforce thanks for reducing that number one person dealing with it now means that other people dont have to categorise it review it stick it in a wikiproject and so on . lds ~0

14733~attendances hi there i see youve been having some trouble with adding the attendance to the hawthorn vs. west coast match. the reason that it kept being removed is one of wikipedias core policies wikipediaverifiability which means we cant add any information to articles that isnt supported by a reference in a reliable source. editors are actually encouraged to remove information that isnt verified that being said it is almost always more productive to start a dialogue than blindly revert. anyway i saw you add the info back so i added a reference to it so it doesnt get reverted again. i encourage you to add references yourself in future so that hopefully this doesnt happen again and please note that references dont have to be online they can be offline such as the reference i added to the season article. i hope you continue to contribute wikipedia needs all the editors we can get. happy editing~0
14734~image copyright problem with imagerice thanks for uploading imagerice however the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. the wikimedia foundation is very careful about the images included in wikipedia because of copyright law see wikipedias copyright policy.the copyright holder is usually the creator the creators employer or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. the three basic license types on wikipedia are open content public domain and fair use. find the appropriate template in wikipediaimage copyright tags and place it on the image page like this {{templatename}}.please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator. if you have any questions feel free to contact me or ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. talk~0

14736~ lou dobbs and glen beck believe what you put on the fringes not just what you say is more mainstream so youre wrong on that one. we already have it established that people have formed conspiracy theories around this and the article establishes that main stream types believe. the article also establishes that people think its nutso. the introduction is not the place to include all of that and it already mentions that it is part of some conspiracy theories in the intro. basically theres no point in including any of this. i said before my issue is not with the information in the article but where it is put and the wording used. addressing one wont address the other. one article calling it an urban legend is also not sufficient to include the wording. it seems more like you are just looking for a new label to discredit the opinion since the conspiracy mention no longer does so. ~0

14739~i agree. but what i was posting was not or. what i was posting was an introduction to what pc is. the intro needs to tell someone reading it a basic understanding of all aspects of the conflict. this wiki is supposed to be the place where people go to begin research. the way it is written after the reverts does not explain the project so much as explain who anonymous is.as far as the sources go they only explain where we got this information. if what i said has no sources then it is tagged citation needed not or. ~0
14740~also i am completely lost to your logic here where you say if you think that such acts are indeed racist then you are simply a racist... what? so on anzac day or the holocasut rememberance day if other people were to carry nazi flags or japan emprial flags and i thought that to be racist then by your reasoning then i am racist... excuse me did anyone else get that? yes i do not like some cultures namely nazi racist culture... that does not mean i am racist to nazis.. does it? i mean that is what rcnaderlori is suggesting... unbeleiveablei am afraid of a culture where i would be gassed if i were jewish or a culture where i will have my lips cut off for wearing lipstick iran or a culture where i will be murdered by my father for having a relationship and dishonouring the family etc... some things are evil nazism gassing of jews and islamic beheadings of infidels yes that is truely evil... i will not tolerate gas chambers or beheadings never its not that i am afraid it is that nature herself has imprinted on my mind the idea of what is good ie protesting rape and hatred for white people and what is bad gaschambers beheadings and gang rape/~0

14750~former porn star turned p.i. paul barresi conduct investigations on behalf of dozens of hollywood celebrities includingtom cruisesylvester stallonearnold schwarzeneggereddie murphybarry bondssince the dawning of the internet gossip can be disseminated around the world with the simple push of a button. our first amendment gives us the right to start a blog and publish whatever we wish to say about anybody. it is much easier to be critical than correct. the freedoms we enjoy in the u.s are wonderful but they are also very dangerous. to create an unfavorable impression it is not necessary that what is said be true. the damage is done in the mere telling of it. no one has felt that sting more than i. last year the mail on sunday falsely reported andrew morton paid me to dig up dirt on tom cruise which could not be further from the truth. the editors finally got around to making the correction.having worked in porn and mainstream film and tv i stand uniquely perched on the scaffold connecting the two biggest industries in hollywood the movie industry and the sex industry which follows the movie industry like the moon. words can be lethal especially for a person in the public eye.~0

14760~ acceptance of reposted article i see that you accepted a draft article on jason binn. when you did so presumably you were aware that an article by the same title had previously been deleted as a result of an afd discussion. if you werent then i suggest in future you should check for any deletion log for any article before you create it. even without any previous deletion history i would have found your acceptance of the draft open to question as it was distinctly promotional in tone and its sourcing was largely to sources which were not independent e.g. his own magazine a press release etc or did not give substantial coverage of him. however in light of the previous afd deletion you should have been particularly cautious about accepting the draft. the editor who uses the pseudonym ~0
14761~hello fisherqueen. please see the an thread. blueboy arbitrary blocked all my accounts which are all legitimate alternate accounts under wpsock. his blocking was without cause or support of same on the thread. imo all of blueboys recent blocks on my accounts should be undone as premature if not unwarranted. by way of explanation both justanother my main account and justahulk a joke alternate account have been disabled by me for some time as a semiretirement. alfadog was blocked at the beginning of this dispute by another admin and i am addressing that separately and not asking for unblock of that account here just asking for unblock of blueboys work. this account was started at the request of admins at the an thread that i choose one voice and stick to that. that request has been withdrawn but i am fine with sticking to this account pending resolution of the an issue. however i feel that blueboys blocks were premature and perhaps punitive and all three should be undone pending any resolution at an. thanks.~0

14764~this user is a proven vandal in wikipedia. until he stops his illfated tactics which clearly fight against wikipedias guidelines his methods shall be used against himself. among his most recent foul play the user leifern has provably participated in pushing false information and improper tactics in relation to the wikipedias kven article including pushing a splitting of that article which attempt has now led to a new informational war in the kven related articles unnecessarily as recently a much welcomed consensus had already been reached. advocating a mindless blocking of an innocent contributor for the kven article is also going to backfire against mr. leifern unless he makes a clear effort to correct things.on behalf of the entire wikipedia community ~0

14766~thank you. actually i love all people. since i love all human beings i dislike and fight against those bad ideas religions and beliefs which obstruct the happiness of all human beings. as you say you are a believer in an abrahamic religion actually i do not dislike and fight against you but dislike and fight against your related ideas and religious creeds. and im very curious why you believe in such kinds of religions with so many such kinds of evil creeds against human beings including the faith that heaven only belong to the believers of your god and religion why other people have to fall into hell? can you belive in some universal faiths that treat all human equally without discrimination? ~0

14769~ traditional or simplified chinese? ive moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. i would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of traditional and simplified chinese in tw related articles without discussing romanisation methods. my aim is just to get a consensus either way and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. i have tried posting similar topics in the hk page as well as the manual of style but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. why are we still including both sets in these articles?naturally i support removing simplified chinese from tw related articles. it is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the prc article as it is to include simplified chinese in the roc article. i am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity but about de facto usage. users in the pinyin section have argued quite well that hanyu pinyin should be included in roc articles because it is used de facto even in tw. so why then cant we eliminate simplified chinese from the tw related articles as tws de facto standard is traditional chinese only? wiki is not a chinese dictionary so is there any reason to include tw and prcs writing systems in the articles of the other? this doesnt have anything to do with anyones personal views on one china or two chinas but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles. open for more discussion. ~0

14787~remove – entire article is of questionable notability. there also appears to be an agenda here being pushed often through tagteam and uncivil retorts on this talk page. wiki seems to turn more into chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of not censored rhetoric each day. im waiting for a photo of a sheep shagger to appear on welsh or scottish article under the guise of notability. some editors here have serious progay coi/pov issues and need to step back especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of homophobia out of turn. why is the solo female fister a cartoon and the male fister a photo for a start? not very neutral. why does there even need to be a photo when all the article needs is a description – i mean its hardly rocket science and that guy hardly has a rocket worth shouting about? you dont need a photo on how to boil eggs so why one here? again its antiwiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids more agenda/politically motivated more pornographic less educational detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see wiki develop. sadly it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites when they themselves use not censored as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. photos such as this are what lead to the foundation considering an image filter recently. im prolgb t but i also believe in behind closed doors. and i disagree with anyone who says kids wont look it up. when i was young kids looked dirty words up in the dictionary. now the internet is here and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. lets put it this way because of no legal threats no lgbt members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this. coppa stands a better chance as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship where there is limited parental control. wikikamasutra anyone?  chat • rff ~0

14789~im asking for proof that it was used as an umbrella term for serbs. since beside vlah it says words and phrases are pejorative if they imply contempt or disapproval. the adjective pejorative is synonymous with derogatory derisive dyslogistic and contemptuous. when used as an adjective pejorative has two meanings tending to make or become worse and tending to disparage or belittle. when used as a noun pejorative means a belittling or disparaging word or expression.thus im asking for you to prove your claims that it was an umbrella term.~0

14798~talkfemale genital mutilation please stophi elvey. i noticed you on johnuniqs page which i watch and was moved to check out the discussion at talkfemale genital mutilation. your part of it worried me. while i have no opinion of my own on the statistics as fgm is not a field ive studied i see two principles in play on that talkpage that are true for all articles and that you seem to pay scant attention to use reliable secondary sources. its important for all articles but more especially for a sensitive subject such as fgm to be based on reliable secondary sources. synthesising sources in order to argue in wikipedias voice with a unicef report from isnt on unless you have a reliable source as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources that offers the same argument. consensus. nobody except partly vetrisimino agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. there is consensus against your section tags described here as overly aggressive. i hope the issue of the tags has blown over but a few days ago you kept restoring them and defend them aggressively the fact that the article is being prepped for wpfac seems to anger you further and makes you accuse slimvirgin of wpown a serious accusation which shouldnt be made without good evidence and which you have taken to svs user talkpage as well.combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. everybody else is speaking respectfully to you as far as i can see youre the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this where you call zads comment blatantly untrue not to mention insulting — based as far as i can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done he wasnt. that kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people eggshells armed with hammers google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships. please dont jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. worse your header here is a noxious badfaithassuming personal attack something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. and you put it as the header to a post by slimvirgin which you had moved there from your own talkpage. that is truly awful behaviour seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. charming edit summary at your own page btw. if you cant stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever youre contradicted this post aggressively attacking johnuniq is a charming recent example i advise you to take a break from the article. thats advice. what i tell you as an uninvolved admin is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before and you must stop attacking people. your accusation against slimvirgin that she is abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute currently at the bottom of the page is made up out of whole cloth as far as i can see. has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin or warned you in any way? if ive missed where sv is playing the admin card tell me where. the word disrupt which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation is by no means the prerogative of admins. talk .i appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at fgm by taking the discussion here. i wish youd participate in the discussion of the facts instead. i feel that in coming here you raise/reiterate some good points but i dont think you should be raising the first few at least here use reliable secondary sources. emphasis is in the original i totally agree and i said that in the discussion the sources are given and reliable and secondary. and also apropos anything about prevalence needs a strong secondary source are you saying that the source were using for reporting the unicef stats in the first place is better? it s~0

14832~how you would classify any title given by leading newspapers as emotional? here are some of the headlines from times of india today future of indian bowling is bleak ranbir kapoor is hard to please why indian men rape. that doesnt mean we are going to include things like these in the intros of the articles on indian cricket team ranbir kapoor or indian people. facts not opinions should be included in the intros plain and simple. delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of india followed by maharashtra you havent read the article you linked to. quote from the article up accounted for the highest .% of the total crime reported in india last year followed by andhra pradesh .% and tn .%. it does say that as a city delhi followed by mumbai tops the crime list among the mega cities. like i said such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita. please read my comment again. you cannot say that tamil nadu is more crimeoriented than goa because tn is on the list far ahead of goa. if the population of goa is times less than that of tn it wont be surprising if cases were reported in tn as opposed to only in goa. delhi and mumbai are the most populous cities in india so its not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities. another example indias gdp is higher than that of australia canada singapore and several other countries that doesnt mean that india is the among the richest countries in the world. the per capita figures are the true indicator. if so then even london is capital of uk does it mean crimes in london could be ignored? thats a straw man argument. who said anything about crimes being ignored? the demographics section of the article on delhi already mentions that delhi accounted for the highest percentage .% of the crimes reported in indian cities with populations of one million or more and delhi accounts for .% of crime against women in indian cities. we are talking about inclusion of pov statements like rape and crime capital in the intro of the article. if you want to add a section to the article go ahead. see new york citycrime for an example. livemint is also not a valid news paper or recognized source like toi or the hindu mint is published by ht media of hindustan times fame in collaboration with the the wall street journal. anyway thats not what we are discussing here.toi has given latest stats . hence your info is out dated compared to mine. nope. like i said you havent read the article you are referring to. its dated . and ive already discussed the article contents above. new comers should be made aware of these to protect their lives by taking caution or avoiding the city see wpagenda. if you want to launch an awareness drive about the crimes in cities like delhi or mumbai or states like up andhra and tamil nadu please start a blog. u are worried about all proofs threatening me to stop me interfering in freedom / rights to express please stop the wikipediadrama. i am an indian but i wasnt born in delhi neither have i lived in delhi. torreslfchero and anna frodesiak arent even indians. so there is no reason why should we be worried. i will bring this to the notice of wiki community soon this should help you wikipediadispute resolution. talk ~0
14833~the question of the stats is a minor quibble. the article is not swamped in stats and is otherwise fine so i wouldnt want to hold up a listing for one sentence i think its something that can be addressed in ongoing development. as part of that ongoing development i would wonder if these stats are not telling us much about the trade and we dont know if they signify that traffic on the river at that time was above or below average what value they are bringing to the reader. im seeing that the main points are that trade was increasing that there was a desire for larger boats to carry the trade and that the river was silting up making passage by larger boats difficult. perhaps a wording such asdoes that work for you? ✔tea time ~0

14835~perhaps we should work on that section here. heres the text which ive started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.oh and the page should probably be all harvard refs rather than none wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author. instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competencesometimes people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal. early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication. however most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a persons pragmatic competence. prior to the mids most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or useful nature of rudeness in speech brown levinson grice lakoff . before then rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure lakoff gave two rules of pragmatic competence be clear and be polite. grice believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness politeness and relevancy. likewise brown and levinsons politeness framework pp. is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in facethreatening acts ftas such as making a complaints or refusing a request. the semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress if the overt content of an utterance is rude for example politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it. brown levinson p. robin lakoff addressed what she named strategic rudeness a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors a courtroom defendant or patient to talk or react in a certain way. gabriele kasper gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper. in her discussion of lakoffs research on strategic rudeness kasper defines rudeness as speech that is constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium kasper p. . this definition is important in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core. although kasper further defines rudeness as motivated and unmotivated her definitions do not make use of natural data. it is not until leslie beebes research comes along in the early to mids that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected. drawing from lakoffs idea of strategic rudeness beebe a b similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal. like lakoff and kasper beebe believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour and indeed in her research she found that hostility seemed to pervade the data beebe p. . in her study of naturally occurring rudeness in new york city beebe provides her own definition of rudenessin this study rudeness is defined as a face threatening act fta or feature of an fta such as intonation which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs. it is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or of course if it does not occur in a context such as intimacy or emergency that would negate the need for redressive action. consequently it causes antagonism discomfort or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony. the idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness. beebe p. in this definition beebe asserts that rudeness is an fta or a feature of an fta that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations. essentially rudeness is a bald onrecord face attack and not a failed attempt at politeness. this definition would also most likely preclude culturallyspecific ritual insults verbal games or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups. labov argues that ritual insults or sounding follow certain linguistic organizational and interactional rules. if such speech among members of a cultural ingroup could be seen as following socially sanctioned norms of interaction as labov argues where there is a low risk of faceloss it would most likely not be considered rude speech according to beebes definition of rudeness. beebe ~0

14849~ historians are incapable of second guessing hitlers inner thoughts there may be some who believe that historians are capable of deciphering hitlers inner thoughts i.e. hitlers religion. this is ignorance and stupidity. they write things such as while historians such as ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock agree that hitler was antichristian. they do not even provide quotes of ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock saying that hitler was antichristian. all they are saying is trust us in our opinion the opinion of ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock is that hitler was anti christian. a far better procedure is to rely on the opinion of hitler himself as to his religion. ~0

14854~im not sure why someone decided to change this into an wprm. the original move is what should have gone through rm i was merely requesting a reversion to the original state which required admin intwervention. now it seems to have got rather sillier now. the situation is still the same the article needs to be moved back to st james park as this was and still is the only article with that name. a dab page is not required if the only directly competing name is the bristol park as that is not even a whole article and even if it was the stadium is clearly the primary use. and a dab page for all similar entries is fine but that must be located at xyz disambiguation the primary articles can still all reside at their original titles without newcastle exeter or london because they have no directly competing titles. this is all explained in the disambiguation guideline. this is not how you deal with subtle name variations.~0

14857~free software example im not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the traditional ip model is as strong as it could be. as far as i can see the standard argument for ip protection is not that its the only way that people can innovate but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. the fact that works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives does not in itself contradict the standard ip model. for such criticism to be very strong you would have to show not only that direct financial incentives are not always required but also that direct financial incentives do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.in other words the standard ip model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. it just says that you will get more overall innovation with ip protection that you would without it. listing counterexamples without also discussing their wider significance does not in itself invalidate the incentives to innovate argument. it would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.~0

14863~ inappropriate tone the following comment seems inappropriate given its placement in the articleon the other hand in maya rituals prisoners of war were in fact killed on top of the pyramid by having his arms and legs held while a priest cut open his chest with a sacrificial flint knife and tore out his heart as an offering.that would be a perfectly fine thing to say if the previous sentence were something like the portrayal of human sacrifice in the film has been criticized as inaccurate. but the previous sentence is the film has been accused of fueling a stereotype of native mesoamericans as bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements other than architecture. by offering the human sacrifice description as an on the other hand the implication is that civilizations that practiced such human sacrifice were actually bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements. thats blatantly pov and inappropriate.i suggest either a deleting the offending sentence b moving it to a portion of the article that discusses human sacrifice in particular or c adding a sentence prior to it quoting some specific criticism of the films portrayal of human sacrifice. a sentence prior to it would be fine there should be something out there that contains criticism. — talk • contrib inaccurate inaccuracies read on the current inaccuracies sectionand the spanish arriving at the end of the movie came a little too soon as they actually arrived during the reign of the aztec empire which succeeded the maya.that sentence had no sense. the aztecs never conquered or killed off the mayas. the mayas where in fact the first mesoamerican people who encountered the spaniards on land around and the spaniards actually knew about the aztecs from the mayas.the diseased little girl is often regarded as having smallpox. however smallpox did not arrive in the americas until the early th century with the spanish conquistadores. as the disease is not called by a modern name we cannot be sure what the intention was.as there are spaniards in the movie its sure that the movie doesnt take place before the th century. however you cant guarantee what is the exact year. they are spaniards but they have not to be the first spaniards in the yucatan just the first in the lands of the mayan citystate that is shown in the movie. spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the yucatan and infect the people there and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. the southern ming never visited europe but their black plague destroyed / of the european population and the incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in mexico extended to south america and killed the emperor and his heir. i suppose that you understand what im trying to say. the girl with smallpox its just another element to support the idea that the end of the mayan civilization is coming why do you assume that they in the yucatan? others make that jump based on the dialect that the director choose to use. if language in the movie is the only thing that ties where the story takes place to the yucatan then i would argue that gibson only used the dialect because it is still a living language used by many of the extras in the cast. i cannot see anything else in the film that cements the idea that this was a movie about the maya in the yucatan. rdg~0

14866~urartuthe first paragraph of the current urartu article contains this statement urartu assyrian urarṭu urartian biainili armenian ուրարտու was an ancient kingdom which existed from ca. bc emerging from the late bronze age until bc. the kingdom of urartu was located in the mountainous plateau between asia minor mesopotamia and caucasus mountains later known as the armenian highland and it centered around lake van presentday eastern turkey. the name corresponds to the biblical ararat. the bible refers to ararat in the book jeremiah but is it a given that the name ararat is indeed derived from urartu. a yes or no answer is good enough dab. i believe that ararat arev always took this position but i dont know if he was right hereat least this once. ~0

14873~you are addressing none of the points provided and you are dismissing the source provided which says tatars refers to most muslim living there. dutchy are not german the lezgis comparison does not make sense we have already covered this. an ethnic group is defined as such the link between the turkic people living there and the azerbaijani is of ancestry for the turkic people and azerbaijani as the product. both are not the same they can not be the same and no article about other peoples which would be neutral will use such a connection. an identity which did not exist at the time can not become existent because you can connect it with an ancestry. this does not make sense we can then even claim the british and germans to be the same.you did the same mistake on the azeris in turkey which is basically full of original research how on earth could turkic people having moved in what is now turkey before the identity be considered as azerbaijanis? from the same token over half the turks could be called azerbaijani. like you said yourself we are not going to waste our time i request a rfc on this article and do you accept? ~0

14885~causessome of my current questions about this important section which i dont understand........yet which ive tried to edit.....quoteseveral mechanisms have been proposed where warmth builds up in the equatorial area then is dispersed to higher latitudes {north? y an el niño event. what mechanisms? how is buildup and dispersal relevant??the cooler area where is that? then has to recharge warmth for several years before another event can take place.citation neededthe maddenjulian oscillation is not a cause of the phenomena but propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle on the order of days and may significantly influence the speed of development and intensity of el niño and la niña. .tropical cyclones north and south of the equator that may play a role in enso are caused by the westerly flow between the areas of low pressure induced by a maddenjulian oscillation. what does this mean??such wind may counteract the typical easterly flows across the pacific and create a tendency toward continuing the eastward motion.citation needed a counteraction of easterly flows creates tendency toward eastward motion??eastwardpropagating oceanic kelvin waves can be produced by maddenjulian activity which may in turn be influenced by a developing el niño leading to a positive feedback. how is this produced how is this influenced?}~0

14890~by no means done the use of cluster bombs on civilian population is a clear violation of the geneva conventions on warfare and consequently a clear war crime and act of state terrorism according to virtually every legal defintion that exists. please remember folks that this is not a democracy. the sources which are quoted here make it quite clear that state terrorism is equivalent to a war crime in a time of peace and / or a policy that endorses war crimes. while i am paraphrasing here a perusal of the sources on the page in question will quickly demonstrate that im correct.thus according to the definitions of state terrorism as made by most international legal bodies and un associated advisors the use of cluster bombs on civilian targets is a clear and unambiguous act of state terrorism. moreover there are quite a few widely published and well respected media organizations who have reported such. ~0

14893~where to put full versions of abbreviated citations re this edit which i mostly reverted. ive run into similar problems elsewhere where a few works are cited many times and its useful to collect the the full citations into a section and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. in daylight saving time i addressed the problem by moving those books into the further reading section which isnt exactly appropriate as further reading is supposed to be for books that werent used as sources i attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the further reading section. in philitas of cos i addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called references to notes and having a new references section containing the list of full citations but its a bit weird and nonuniform to have the section title move to the newlyadded section when you need the new section. i vaguely recall seeing an listoffullcitations section called bibliography in some other article but thats not appropriate either as the mos says that bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. i dont know of any useful guideline in wikipedia in this problematic area. the approach currently taken in tourette syndrome references isnt clearly wrong and is arguably better than whats in daylight saving time or in philitas of cos not only because it doesnt abuse further reading and references as titles but also because it puts the most important references first.~0

14897~wikipedia as an encyclopedia is about describing a subject not promoting it. describing erics beliefs and activities is different than promoting them and the language used for the different purposes is different. promotion uses charged words whereas describing used neutral boring words. describing erics point of view is appropriate for this setting. saying it is the best or worst view is promotional. i agree with your statement that we should leave the judgement out of this. exactly. thats what npov is all about. eric is the proponent of a fringe theory. got it. so explain what his fringe theory is provide refs and move on. im not saying hes right or wrong. i dont care. but it doesnt make sense to me to have an article on someone that doesnt describe who they are what theyve done or why they are notable. leaving out the middle section on his scientific activities cosmology fusion stuff and other is a disservice to anyone who comes to this page. describe yes. promote no.~0

14932~have you evidence that any of mendelssohns contemporaries regarded him as jewish? the notion of jewishness being genetically defined is a th century one that should be left behind with the vile political movements that accompanied it. what evidence have you that mine is a minority view? a visit to an israeli city is enough to show that jewishness cannot possibly be racially defined except for political purposes every racial group is present from nordic to african all jewish in mendelssohns time there were simply three religious communities in germany and folks moved like the mendelssohns from one to another. dont perpetuate nazism.~0
14933~ years to done reply to usertalkgreyshadowyearstodone.i lost count above i was waiting on your comments. feel free to publish at any time. i will move what is in the incomplete list to the novels stubs. i am glad you like the format. i will continue to add more but that will do for now. i will put the new list up today so it does what the page says. sorry for the delay i was waiting on your comment. eagle talk yes please feel free to modify my statement. publish all the plans. i would like to have more imput eagle talk novels and movies for articles that cover both a novel and a movie of the same title is there a standard article title format to split them up e.g. starship trropers novel starship troopers movie? also is there a standard novel infobox to be used at this time?second things first. non specifically but we use {tinfobox book}}. on the naming the major work of the two would tend to get the basic title and the other would tend to get either title novel or title film or if more than one title jo soap novel or title film. hope that helps. dont forget disambiguation pages. talk page/ and thanks for the heads up regarding archives. seems a much better way to clean up. no problem. talk page/ criteria criteria is as you set it. i will move the book to novel stuff to the right place. within hours of this post i will put up the new prototype list. status of the code is go . note on the criteria for the current lists it is as stated. for the new proto list up in hours of this post it will be very simple are the hits correct am i giving you guys articles that have complete infoboxes? i can guarrentee that all the articles will have an infobox... becuase i will be parsing the template category. the primary problem will be to seperate out novels from the books. right now the code will give both remember this is a wiki... all i am doing is writing the code this wikiproject needs to tell me what to do. p.s. i want to start to have conversations on one of our forums wpnovel talk page rather than on our talk pages. eagle talk to make it % clear the new proto list will have all the incomplete infoboxes. our problem will be sorting the novels from the books. of course we could do both... or make this list a joint project... eagle talk ok by july utc i will be ready. feel free to edit my statement in the newsletter i have other things on my hand. thanks eagle talk novels wikiproject newsletter july here is the new edition of our monthly newsletter.{ colspan= valign=middle style=width % background ffc border px gray solid padding em the novels wikiproject newsletter issue ii july valign=top style=border px gray solid padding em width % project news the projects automatically generated worklist novels without infobox has been worked through giving infoboxes to most of the s. this is about to get a regeneration probably with new genres. in addition to the raft of articles on the simon templar as the saint novels added last month then the modesty blaise series and now starting on matt helm series. all the inital work of one editor one editor has been putting in sterling work coverting novel articles from yyyy books categorization over to yyyy novels. again notice that the now has a new field for illustrator for indic~0

14943~red peacock you are correct to think something is amiss. xeno apparently only saw that portion of the interview in which susan actively argues with the insane man holding the hitler picture as if that alone wasnt unprofessional. apparently he didnt catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad discussed at length in the article on behalf of obama. and perhaps most importantly he clearly didn’t catch how susan treated individuals who accused bush of being hitler just several years ago. obviously i don’t intend for that video to go up in the article but i include it to demonstrate that xeno’s hitlerrelated argument is to be charitable a laughing matter. by the way redpeacock. if you ever want something really entertaining to do i would suggest going to the keith olbermann article and looking at the nowinfamous “criticism” section in the talk page. a few conservatives were able to play on the olbermannworshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke. seriously – it’s really long but well worth the read. i think a book could be written about it perhaps as part of a larger effort to study why people are so biased on wikipedia and – more importantly – why they can’t just be open about it.~0
14944~ agree with user humus above. and to answer your specific question on french bolshevism the number of frenchmen in the russian empire was practically zero. but if there were a significant number it too would be racist. any such usage suggests a defect in a people race nationality can only be such in the context you give. what you are saying by it is again that there was something in the nature of the jew which mad him a communist but russians are nicer people so they are not inclined to be communists. thats what the phrase means and nothing more. the purpose of this article is to document antisemitism and not to be antisemitic like the protocols of zion. you are only trying to do what these protocls are all about to say that jews or primarily jews are responsible for the communist fate of russia. that why you do not have a reference to support your usage. do you understand me? ~0

14946~ third opinion hey. so ive looked over the conversation here and to be honest i dont have any problem with the url category. it doesnt really strike as spam since they all seem to fit the inclusion criteria. the links might be more gracefully included than just the standard numbered link maybe have it say and have the link but it seems okay. similarly wpnotlink doesnt apply here since there is a lot more meaningful data attached to the entries in the list.as a side note i think it would be most helpful to this article to either create articles for each of the entries on here or at least give some references as to why theyre notable. i personally dont see the alexa criterion as making it notable and instead id just fall on wpweb as a way of determining notability. — say whaaat? ~0

14971~ the mother carries her kittens. it should also point out that the behaviour links to mating as well. during mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a ready posture when not in heat or even male cats when grasped by the scruff. ... ive added this see catskin think outside the box scientific classification it appears that the current use of f. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. i propose it is changed back to f. catus. first this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion most recently/archive species name and/archive scientific namethis discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. it was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus but no such citations were given. the article in its current state under scientific classification cites iczn opinion . however as was noted in the prior discussion this is a misinterpretation of the ruling which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals see this note specifically reading from this erroneous nomenclature and the preceding paragraphs. itis was also cited in discussion. this clearly prefers catus as the conventional name although it cites mws in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.it would therefore be much more npov to acknowledge f. catus as the usual name. if catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under scientific classification. currently this section should have {{disputedsectionscientific classification}} put on it because its interpretation of the source is wrong. i would do this but im a new user so semiprotection is stopping me. it would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence all the most cited most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured f. catus.also while this is still semiprotected id like to point out that both inline citations of mammal species of the world should be removed. the first is uncalled for by wpleadcitations. the name cat is common knowledge and is recognised by all other references in the article body. the second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. msw doesnt even mention these names so its unfair to synthesise from that that wozencraft let alone all feline biologists does not support them. however msw is a useful reference so i suggest moving the citation to external links or a probablyneeded further reading section. works for me. my opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and f. catus is now the accepted name then so be it. {chat} msw is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. it uses felis catus and notes there is some controversy. we should do the same. talk i view this with suspicion. if s interpretation is true then itis should not report the domestic dog as canis lupus familiaris and call canis familiaris invalid. the itis webpage has no entry at all for felis silvestris catus not even to call it invalid. felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. i draw this from from uses of felis silvestris catus many uses of felis silvestris f catus whatever that notation means.from ~0

14973~the wallace line demarcates biogeographical continents which to a large extent coincide with the geological continents. on those grounds east timor is not a part of asia. on the other hand it seems that geopolitically east timor is considered a part of asia.there are two problems i see with your position.firstly oceania is a geopolitical continent not a biogeographic or geological one. from the geopolitical point of view east timor is in asia. from any other point of view oceania doesnt exist. either way east timor is not a part of oceania.secondly reputable sources have been presented which state straight out that east timor is in asia. they may not state their criteria but they are unambiguous in their position. you on the other hand are unable to present any sources and are relying entirely upon reasoning. i salute your reasoning but the fact is the sources win. the cia and the un are considered more reliable that your good self no matter how ingenious your rationale. wikipedia has a longstanding verifiability policy that states the threshold for inclusion in wikipedia is verifiability not truth.hesperian ~0

14983~use of the bible as a source i have deleted a long section on the biblical mentions of the philistines. theres nothing inherently wrong with using the bible as a source but it has to be done with care and via reliable secondary/tertiary sources and that was not being done in this section. the dangers of an approach like this can be seen in the failure to place the genesis table of nations for example in context it was treated in the th century work as if it were to be dated from the nd millennium when in fact modern scholarship is just about unanimous in putting it in the persian period. modern secondary sources are a must.~0

14986~fgr is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. a couple of things i noted. the table of p shows a good dozen elements including ca where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on model to the next. the following summary on p says for about % of radionuclides the differences are not substantial ie. less than a factor of four. that points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test which it is not its a model . the magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of is seen as not substantial gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be. i dont know what the exchange rate for k is but it is prsesent in significant amounts in the urine at concentrations that vary comparatively widely.this would suggest i suppose that the body regulates k very closely disposingof excess amounts very rapidly. perhaps someone should do a study by feedingreference bananas to.... his dotsi have found this banana equivalent dose very useful in attempting toexplain infinitesmal doses and corresponding infinitesmal risks to membersof the public. interestingly the antinukes just hate this and severelycritisize us for using such a deceptive concept.would love to go into more detail but have to get back to our deadly humanradiation experiments i.e. eating bananas.considering the fact that the doe has officially stated that there is no safedose of radiation my advice to you all is to stop eating immediately.disclaimerneither lawrence livermore national laboratory the university of californianor the department of energy recommends eating bananas.so it seems the advocates of this bed idea do regard it as a bit of an insider joke and take joy in using it to be provocative. but if the k in a banana is times more potent than that already in muscle tissue there is still a substantial problem somewhere. at least this is getting closer to understanding where it comes from and how it is calculated.~0
14987~is there some confusion here between two composers with the same name? i had always assumed that john barleycorn the childrens opera was composed by the english composer bruce montgomery aka edmund crispin. there are certainly other references on the web to that effect though they could easily be wrong. the one thing that makes me think it more likely is that the opera was published by novello which also published other of the british montgomerys works. i cant see any similar references other than this one to it being composed by the american montgomery. does anybody know?~0

15007~undoubtedly it will be found at the end of the day that drugs featured in her death as they did in the death of poor danielscott fri feb. breakinplease take notice that less than hours after anna nicoles death anna nicoles house was broken into and all of her personal items were stolen.despite an existing injunction from the bahamas supreme court enjoining g. ben thompson and his agents from entering the property that was clearly posted on all entrances persons purporting to act on mr. thompsons behalf including stancil ford shelly and others believed to be gina shelly gaither ben thompson ii melanie thompson and tracy ferguson anna nicoles former lawyer entered the house without consent and then the locks were changed. certain of these individuals were also observed removing numerous items from the premises.upon becoming aware of these activities lawyers representing anna nicoles interests obtained another injunction from the bahamas supreme court and subsequently reacquired possession of the house with the aid of the bahamas royal police force.when howard stern returned to the house a day later he learned that all of anna nicoles personal items had been stolen. these items included computers external hard drives minidv tapes and dvds containing all of anna nicoles personal digital photos and digital home videos many of which are extraordinarily personal in nature and a dvd of anna nicoles most recent movie illegal aliens that has yet to be released in theatres. all of anna nicoles personal documents were also stolen including confidential contracts banking information attorneyclient privileged documents and dannielynns birth certificate. even paintings hanging in the nursery that anna nicole had painted for dannielynn were stolen.howard stern also found a piece of paper pinned to a lamp with the names and phone numbers of gina and ford shelly and melanie and gaither ben thompson ii.lawyers representing anna nicoles interests are currently working with authorities in the bahamas and the united states to prosecute all culpable individuals to the fullest extent of the law to prevent the dissemination of any illegally obtained material and to secure the return of all of the stolen items.any individual firm or entity that uses reproduces and/or otherwise disseminates any item of personal property of anna nicole and/or her estate without the prior written consent of ron rale will be held liable to the fullest extent of the law.~0

15012~eliminating geometrical and physical opticsyou wrote above when describing redshift mechanisms we need to eliminate geometrical and physical optics. i note that youve included the wolf effect which is consistent with your statement.the article on the wolf effect includes reliable sources stating that the wolf effect is a redshift mechanism.can you provide a source that indciates that the wolf effect should be excluded as you stated i understand that many books might not include it for whatever reason but this is not the same as excluding it or how about a source excluding physical optics from redshift mechanism? ~0
15013~not enough inline citationsperhaps you might like to comment on my stance over here? reimage i saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. i cannot undelete the image because of wpfuc .b. the image has not been reduced in size. i also believe it fails in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. is also jumping out at me because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. there is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article chronology of the year zero alternate reality game. therefore the exact image you uploaded isnt appropriate for use on wikipedia and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate but in the proposed article would just be decorative and against out nonfree content policy. sorry but i hope this explanation helps. talk thanks very much for the reply. i understand your fairuse concerns and hopefully i can address all of them.fuc .b agreed. if the image is undeleted id be happy to reduce its size and upload the smaller version but i cant really do that download the high resolution version until it is undeleted.fuc there are no commercial opportunities at stake here. because of the odd nature of the website as part of an alternate reality game the only logical copyright holder would be either nine inch nails entertainment or interscope records. no one is making any money off of these websites in fact they officially have absolutely no connection to any company not even to the album year zero album that it is parallel to. reznor himself has stated the arg is not a promotional device. see year zero alternate reality game for more info on thatfuc although the dates themselves are similar the text is not. the whole point of the originating website another version of the past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events. the text in the wp article is a dry pointforpoint account neutral if you will. the two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand proamerican progovernment etc and on the other hand extremist rebellious reformatory etc. the image provides the user an opportunity to see the pov/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened. for example the new orleans floods are described as a faithbased disaster on one hand and why bother with new orleans? on the other. i still believe the image wouldnt be appropriate here. the site the image came from is copyrighted and was used to promote the album for the record company executives regardless what reznor said so fuc still concerns me and im not convinced of fuc either. we can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. wed need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image imo. i have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here so be patient for a nd opinion. thanks for your reply. talk greetings. i was asked to comment here. this image is essentially text with decorative flourishes. as such i dont see how it could pass wpnfcc which requires that a nonfree image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. i dont believe that the text alone quoted would be less informative than the image. and i think that much text quoted verbatim would be a copyright violation which is another indicator that this image isnt allowed. all the best – talk random ok fair enough. i know better than to argue with two admins. = thanks for taking the time to review the case. lightning bolt discog im not trying to kill you it just looks like an unneccessary article to me. in my opinion their discog isnt so cumbersome that it cant fit in their main article. if you disagree fine im not that worried about. totally fine. i dont feel anywhere near strongly enough to care that much. good luck on it cheers usermur~0

15020~the malvern water curefor what its worth i concur that the malvern water article benefitted from the exercise. to me the best indicator that userjerem was acting in good faith on november with the talkmalvern wateradvertising tag was that it was jerem who removed it following gyros efforts. i came to that article late so wasnt caught up in the earlier argybargy so to speak. but i see that since the efforts surrounding that period both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. there certainly was quite a bit of reference to the malvern water article in our discussions. mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. one exemplified by malvern water and one exemplified by shakespeare. mind you the william penn article might benefit from the latter style but not necessarily. i counted individual page citations for hans fantels book nearly double that of schoenbaum in shakespeare.the above discussions highlight another thing which the malvern water article exemplifies. how one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. the problem being the criticism and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith and see what transpires in this case an improvement. of course this might not always be the outcome. but assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. not everyone knows how to constructively criticise we typically learn that through experience if were lucky in my own life id have handled many past situations differently in light of what i now know. and by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith if perchance they are maliciously based that will become so selfevident that its impossible for any reasonable person to miss. even then what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. a funny old world indeed what with that and the irony that the malvern water cure still seems to be working its magic wotnow~0

15034~>expected by whom? sir issaac newton and the law of gravity wherein a bleeding heart opened by a mm plus diameter hole bleeds blood down onto the shooter below him who claimed martin was over him when he shot him. if this didnt happen then the shooter is lying about what happened. this descrepancy should be pointed out in this article in order to appear to be neutral about the matter reporting wise. whats also missing is a photograph of trayvon martins chest and shirt and amount of bloodletting which should have been released as well. where is it spd / coroners office ??? also who said anything about tv special effects? try and answer to what i wrote rather than respondong to your vivid imaginings. youll be way more credible. your argument that a mm wound had zero chance of bleeding at all is incredible but thanks for trying desparately to nonsensically support zimmerman.~0

15040~lycanthropy for turning into the beast form goes back to ancient greece. the fact that some writing discussed the issue and did not believe in the supernatural aspect and thus said it was only a delusion doesnt change the fact that the original references as well as other references the whole time that did believe in supernatural existed and thats what the article is referring to and its correct so leave it alone.~0
15041~reading the above and looking at the editing history it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not. since i am an engineer in the aerospace industry i though i would draw an analogy from that industry that illustrated the point. i was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed. every reference book i checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous it was even in my uni notes. but to the analogy. the harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces elevator ailerons rudder. this is of course unarguably an analogue signalling system. the wire linkage forms a continuous signal and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.the typhoon aircraft in contrast uses a digital system. the position of the pilots joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer. the resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system. both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.the surprise was that in the preamble notes the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to ... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence not really analogue at all.in the subject context the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement i.e. the majority of clocks is not analogue and is wrong to continue to insist that it is. ~0
15042~two out of three isnt a very large majority. the person who said in their edit summary that irv kupcinet was superfamous and known to every american is showing pov. if his newspaper column was syndicated to newspapers as the person wildhartlivie claimed thats leaving out many cities and towns. i checked all three of the newspapers that existed in washington dc at the time karyn died and none of them carried kups column. people in dc couldnt watch his tv talk show either. it wasnt listed in the local tv guide. if a celebrity wasnt in washington dc in then he/she wasnt in a lot of places. same goes for raleigh north carolina. i checked the news observer in . no kups column. other good sources are people who were over the age of living in dc and raleigh in . ive talked with them and they say they never heard of irv kupcinet until i told them about karyns death.i already named the raleigh newspaper. if you insist dc people did indeed know about and care about irv kupcinet at the time his daughter died then please name all three dc newspapers from that period. if your majority is as sound as you claim then lets hear from the contributor known as gamaliel. if you know so much about wikipedia then maybe you know what gamaliels position is. he/she has said that negative information about coroner harold kade is relevant as long as it is sourced. and it is. ~0

15071~ga sweeps invitationhello i hope you are doing well. i am sending you this message since you are a member of the ga wikiproject. i would like to invite you to consider helping with the ga sweeps process. sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest gas still meet the criteria and improve the quality of gas overall. unfortunately last month only two articles were reviewed. this is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when articles were reviewed in september . after nearly two years the running total has just passed the % mark. in order to expediate the reviewing several changes have been made to the process. a new worklist has been created detailing which articles are left to review. all exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. instead of reviewing by topic you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.we are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist please visit the ga sweeps page. in addition for every member that reviews articles or has a significant impact on the process s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. if only editors achieve this feat starting now we would be done with sweeps of course having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved so please consider asking others to help out. feel free to stop by and only review a few articles somethings better than nothing take a look at the list and see what articles interest you. lets work to complete sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at gan. if you have any questions about the process reviewing or need help with a particular article please contact me or and well be happy to help. happy editing talk • contrib~0

15114~unbelieveable. absolutely unbelieveable. it had slipped my mind that i actually did try once more to knock some sense in with that remark on the infallible doctors talk page. that was a mistake. a momentary lapse of reason. id somehow got it into my head that somehow someway just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. id forgotten that logic has no place here.clio basically told dirk he doesnt know shit and so i basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that youre letting her get away with murder.and then came the ugliness. id forgotten about the whole thing until just now when i noticed in my contributions that id apparently made a remark on her page. talk about a personal attack. i swear ive rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. and all about me. such anger such twisted hatred such disturbed imagery...no. i dont care how irritating this whole thing is. its not worth it. this girl is not well and neither of us are helping. havent you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? havent you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the humanities refdesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives into the stale singlefaceted unidimensional useless place it is now?no. its not worth it. its futile. worse actually. perhaps i share in some of the blame myself. if it wasnt for my relentless protestations perhaps the whole thing would have blown over clio would have gotten bored of the humanities refdesk moved on and it wouldnt be the cold sterile place it is now.perhaps i lost perspective and didnt realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.just please read the damn thing over rockpocket. here it is . those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. i recognize that now. i have to stop. what im doing is wrong. so to all who will inevitably read this i say publicly to clioyou win. i lose. youre right. im wrong. youre smart and you were right all along im an intellectually impoverished imbecile. yes as you say im pathetic. im honestly genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. i dont belong editing here on wikipedia as i cant even approach your level of intelligence. i wish you nothing but health and happiness. be well. lewis with four degrees.~0

15181~hallo yopie thank you for your message. but what exactly makes it a preferred article? i am only writing what is true. you can check this at the website and whatever sources you want. i am providing enough resources to prove the thing thats write. this is not an article war. its just truth.~0
15182~ decline = i see that you have concerns that wellsourced critical content about a school is given too much weight in an article about that school. i see no reason to doubt that your concerns about that are sincere. i equally have no doubt that the dissent from that view on the part of other editors is sincere. as the administrator assessing your unblock request it is no part of my job to assess the validity of either of those evidently sincere opinions. it is however my task to assess how you have handled the disagreement. you have refused to consider that there may be genuine goodfaith disagreement but have instead repeatedly thrown accusations of malice against those who have expressed opinions contrary to yours. you have wikilawyered and twisted and twisted to try to show that you are right. you have treated wikipedia as a battleground where the way to deal with anyone you disagree with is to relentlessly attack them not as a collaborative environment where the way to deal with disagreements is to discuss with a view to trying to reach agreement. you have persistently refused to accept that wikipedia works by consensus not by the person who shouts most loudly right is on my side gets his or her way. you have attempted to intimidate other editors by suggesting that they might be subject to legal redress. i have no interest in engaging with semantic quarrels about whether what you said constituted attacks or not. you have repeatedly and persistently failed to hear what others have said to you when it has not suited your preferred view. you have repeatedly accused other editors of doing exactly the kind of things that i see you doing all the time. i get the impression that you sincerely do not see that you have been doing those things but that is how it looks to me viewing the matter as an uninvolved outsider who had never before heard of this dispute nor even of the school in question. as you have done with other issues you wikilawyer over whether what you have done fits your reading of a definition of disruptive that you dredge up i have no interest in responding to that i simply ask myself do this editors actions disrupt the working of the wikipedia community? to which the answer is clearly and obviously yes very much so. the only thing about this block which might be reconsidered is that it is for a mere three days. considering that your disruptive editing has been continuing over a period of more than three months i would have blocked you for significantly longer. i suggest that you may find it helpful to stand back look at your editing try to imagine how it must look from the detached perspective of an uninvolved third party and think how when this very short block expires you may be able to edit in ways that look more constructive to such a third party. the editor who uses the pseudonym ~0
15183~ not sure why you deleted my addition to the israeli nature reserves article hi sean you took out references in the following articlethe other sources currently in the article that are considered legitimate are as representative of a zionist view as my sources are of an alternative view. some of them are straight propaganda and news articles and websites. why is mondoweiss bad these sources good?for the comment about the zionist founding myth i used a published book so am really confused about why you would remove that reference. are you playing favorites here?thanksfreespeechinbrooklyn ~0
15184~contested deletion this article should not be speedy deleted as being recently created having no relevant page history and duplicating an existing english wikipedia topic because... your reason here this article contains valid interesting in fact fascinating and notable information. those who have suggested that it be deleted should be flogged and cast off a cliff for tyrannical behaviour and for contributing to the early heat death of the universe get a job end note sent in jest and in good faith~0

15189~say hello to our good friend the copyright law. this good friend of wikipedia prevents us from using those pictures and pretty much forces someone to take pictures of their wangs and upload them to wikipedia because thats the only way one can make sure the wangs er the pictures are rightfully donated to wikipedia.~0
15190~what??? till hes retired?? he is the first player to not win a championship with back to back mvps. its redundant?? so is everything positive about the guy. no it is not because people from all around the world dont know that. do you want me to add never??? i will add it. it is not inappropriate. explain how the other players are appropriate then??? explain that category that he falls into with the others. they did not vote him as mvp and most of them were not playing when he won his back to back awards. he is also different from those guys because he never won a championships. he is the same as those now we must post how hes different. you have agendas man that is why this site is so horrible. it is so biased. hganesan~0
15191~leave now leave now~0
15192~ suggest renaming this article is as currently written really about the prospective effects of global warming on humans not the general effects of climate change. an article as broadly titled as this on the effects of climate change would have to speak about climate changes generally. these would perforce include historic effects of climate change such as the little ice age the roman warming period ice ages etc. we could include such historic climate effects here but given the thrust of the article it would probably be best just to do a renaming. ~0
15193~colony collapse disorderi noticed you added beekeeping to the wikipediawikiproject beekeeping ... would you do the same for the ccd article?~0
15194~i feel like you have more to worry about by posting yourself on the wpani than i possibly could. especially if they review your pov edits on the varrious hrc related pages. as always the best way to stop people from calling out your misbehavior is to stop misbehaving.  ☎ ~0

15196~here is a letter that will be sent today // to geoff hayes a councillor for bray council which may be of interest to readers of this site june major william thomas forshaw v.c.now that you have skilfully discovered where our local vc lived and died and further to our recent discussions on putting a suitable plaque on the house in gays lane – i am pleased to say that it would be an understatement to say that the present owners are happy to agree to this. i have tried contacting english heritage for the blue plaque with little success.i enclose all emails etc for your information.a local council funded and designed plaque maybe more in keeping especially if local schoolchildren are involved with the design based on certain parameters.would you be kind enough to put the matter before the council at your next meeting for the necessary permissions and funding?yours sincerelyterry nicolson~0

15199~maverick read my user page. im in fact a conservative republican. im not biased. also if you want me to calm it down then how about this? in april cruz told a group of gun owners in new hampshire that he had been pressing fellow republican senator john mccain to hold hearings on whether service members should be allowed to carry concealed firearms on military mccain responded to cruzs assertion saying that neither he nor his staff had heard anything from cruz about the cruz later admitted that he misspoke about the issue and that he had not in fact talked to mccain about looks neutral to me. ~0

15202~ i have reverted your edits to the article about georgia okeeffe. the things you write dont belong in any article certainly not at wikipedia. stop doing this think for a moment about your childish behaviour. going on like this will certainly get you blocked ~0
15203~ august utcconcerning mesić this is not just one poll i am talking about there were many. every so often the news publish the results of the various agencies that researched this phenomenon. these polls do not repeat do not center on the capital. they are highly professional and reliable and in each one mesić was voted the most popular. need i also mention the ultimate poll of all? the presidential elections? two of them in fact both of which he won as an independent candidate and did not rely on the support of any party. furthermore i find the idea that football hooligans represent the croatian people highly offensive as opposed to for example university students. i also do not know where you get the idea that the entire croatian national football team is extreme rightwing that is not the case.i imagine you must have come into contact only with certain circles of croatian society. perković generally draws his support from the rather rural parts of croatia and from people that hail from such warstricken and... undeveloped areas. modern prowestern central urban areas far from supporting the great patriot perković are the source of the many recent protests against him. ive not known him on a personal level for years so i cannot say whether or not he really cares about the croatian people. i do know that professing eternal love for the holy soil of croatia is absolutely essential for his cash flow though. quite frankly i do not care about whether he really loves croatia all i know is that he is the public focal point of a backward nationalist mentality that has claimed far too many victims and destroyed far too many economies around here. i dare say it is a little too easy to support such a mentality from a distance where its primitivistic repercussions cannot be felt. talk ~0
15204~speedy deletion of a tag has been placed on requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for web content. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ~0

15206~i further object to the constant bad faith and ridiculous lying commentary of those in support irc channels.~0
15207~ response as i linked above you should read wpcopyright. in addition to not being freely available the content is suited for your personal site and not for an encyclopedia. it is not neutral and there is no evidence your group is notable which is why its limited to a mention in the school article. please let me know if you have any questions im happy to help. starm ~0

15209~entrpreneurialmindsetsomeone with the user name maxsenges has been editing this article. the article reads as an exploration of original thought. much of the material is edited and contributed from user maxsenges. it appears that his original thought is promoted on wikipedia. what should i do?— ~0

15212~so if there is an article on joppa in wikipedia and the number one use of the word is the show joppa then youre saying that a mention is not even considered. ill warn you again this is borderline harrassment. please stop or ill be forced to take action. wikipedia has an article on the word joppa. all meanings including the number one should be inlcuded even if you maliciously deleted the page. ~0
15213~what homosexual tom atkins and draft dodger wayne were father figures? whatever. maybe i should report your remark as a personal attack.~0
15214~please refrain from adding nonsense to wikipedia as you did to may . it is considered vandalism. if you would like to experiment use the sandbox.~0
15215~can a single that reaches number one in sales really be considered a flop? perhaps the wording should be changed to something about disappointing sales rather than it being stated as an abject failure. ~0
15216~yes theres no problem with leaving it in a partial format. its not good to have articles in such a condition that we cant understand that theyre significant however youve shown that its important enough to have an encyclopedia article so working at it piecebypiece should be quite fine.~0
15217~this is a talk page on which we can discuss anything...including the poem. and i do not understand why you are asking me to create a new topic heading to continue the same topic...it makes no sense.~0

15228~a few points all cabals are bad ideas. if you want something done find a taskforce or create a workforce. we are dealing w/ admins. the mfd might be snowballed. id like to see proof that there is proof or isnt. perhaps scanning the users contribs for any edit summary mention of the cabal. im in so much wikitrouble now that...a if i get in anymore i might be blockedb i really couldnt care less if i did i wont nom it but ill support deletion as goes for all those other cabals out there.you can weigh these and make your decision of what to do. choose wisely and let the wikiforce be w/ you. basketball /tell me yours ~0

15231~thank you for your help. i agree with you that it needs to be neutral and stay on topic. like i said i only wanted to list out all of the specialties equally who perform occuloplastic procedures. i also invite you to contact the american and australiasian boards and colleges of oral and maxillofacial otolaryngology and plastic and reconstructive surgery. im sure they will be able to provide you with plenty of information as well. thank again for your help.~0
15232~bath salts drugyour redirect is unacceptable. the article is cited if you want to delete it then place an +afd and build a consensus~0
15233~but i will keep adding them back if deleted as i want others to see missing information.~0
15234~it has been confirmed that raul has joined fc schalke . here is the link ~0
15235~ meaning of the name in czech i had to correct the following statement the boy named crow kafka means crow in czech.. in fact the czech word for crow is vrána cf. csvrána. the actual and exact meaning of kavka is jackdaw a bird of coloeus subgenus specifically the western jackdaw coloeus monedula cf. cskavka in surnames the middle consonant occurs spelled v or f but pronunciation behind remains the same . while jackdaws and crows corone subgenus are similar closely related birds and visual misidentification sometimes occurs the semantical border betwen jackdaw nad crow remains clearly drawn in the czech language at least when looking from the jackdaw side towards crows. crows feature more prominently in common parlance proverbs etc. therefore sometimes other crowlike birds ravens etc. are called simply crows but on the other hand if one says kavka he/she certainly refers specifically to a jackdaw and doesnt mean vrána either of two species native to the czech lands carrion crow corvus corone or hooded crow corvus cornix. being unfamiliar with japanese naming of the various corvidae i hope this will help to clarify the naming issue at least from czech perspective. presumably that inaccuracy/oversimplification arose in chain of translation across several languages. ~0
15236~lyrics the whole lyrics section is pointless and i have removed it~0
15237~to continue this discussion i have a problem with npov and the title. i think the article should be renamed russian intervention in ukraine because the military aspect is contested but obviously there is an intervention and will open a discussion on it when i figure out how or someone else could do so to save me the bother.~0
15238~all i wanted to do was note this painter which painted me something great and helps out his community and i think he is a great man. and you wiki guys are so jealous that this man is great than you that is very sad. your lives must be so empty that you try to wield power on this site. this might be an actually great site. to bad you make this your power self.he did not just paint me he has painted so many things. so thats why i am so lamented about thisgo ahead censor me i guess your not an american. you have never heard of freedom of speech.~0
15239~does this look good? i changed it as the source does not talk about theme or musical style... it only specifies kissoff anthem which is indeed true judging from the lyrics. is what i have written good? talk ~0
15240~rules of the death note hello i must say thank you for deleting this article and enforicing wikipedias policies to make the stie a better place. incidently i was just going to start looking into this subject as ive recently started reading this series but now i cant find any halfway decent places on the internet to find this information. could you kindly make the article into a user subpage for me so i can read it? thanks. ~0
15241~ truce? i once again rightfully edited the article however i removed the titles and simply stuck to the years. the fact that for example the launch of nxt is about a paragraph of nxt then jumps from wwe present clearly does not qualify under the launch of nxt whereas the return of ecw and money in the bank paragraphs are soley based on their titles. i beg you to read what i contributed that you had missed and see for yourself. i dont know how to add sources but many of my contributions came from watching the product and hearing the onscreen events take place. if youd like to source them go right ahead but i will keep adding them back if deleted as i want others to see missing information.~0

15248~ cparker i dont know what you did after but if anyone else has this kind of issue i would suggest you consider the lap band instead. it does not require the drastic resectioning of your organs that is done in roux en y/gastric bypass. in the surgery you lose more than a foot of your small intestine that you cant get back and that is necessary if it is connected to the stomach in its normal position the area where that connection originally occurred is closed off by sutures the area of your stomach that is stapled creates a bifurcated stomach that cannot be reopened it is completely irreversible. this is a complete and permanent lifestyle and physiological change that should never be taken lightly. see my comments in other comment sections on this page about about the difference between your pre and postsurgical life. you will be on a diet for life you will not be returning to your prior eating habits and as i mention above you may not even want to. your tastebuds will change. your nutritional needs will be reprioritized. you still have to actively pursue the weight loss it isnt that they cut your stomach down and you eat what you want and lose weight that is not how it works at all. you will be nauseated after the surgery mine lasted for the two and a half months during which i was on pureed food only i begged people to pray for me it was so bad but once i was back on solid food it went away. that may have been unique to me. there are many problems that occur with everyone but some will be unique to you. my program made me do months of supervised calorie a day diet and exercise as much as i could with other conditions hampering me and prior to that my pcp and i tried a similar program ourselves. so there is no trying it out you are either in the program or not. but i can tell you after almost a decade of obesity caused by medications i take for other conditions and to be honest exacerbated by overeating for the first time in my life also a sideeffect of those meds i have lost about lbs. in the months since my surgery. seeing the scale keep going down and down is a good feeling. with the surgery it happens quickly at first and then slows down with the lap band its just the opposite. make sure you are totally informed before you make a choice and choose your surgeon and their program wisely. do your homework. plus they have screening methods also to make sure you are not wasting their time. you will be given a psychological evaluation similar to having plastic surgery to make sure you understand the risks the benefits the amount of involvement you play in your weight loss journey and if you are ready for it. ~0
15249~cozumeli added a citation needed tag to information you added to the cozumel concerning its recovery from hurricane wilma. is this information that you got from a source or from your firsthand observation? as im sure youre aware wikipedia requires that any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged must be accompanied by a reliable published source. the wilma section of the cozumel article has been challenged in the past and is likely to be challenged again in the future with there being lots of people in the scuba diving community who say cozumel is great fully recovered and those saying its still damaged or was irreparably harmed by wilma. if you have a source for this you can provide that would be great ~0
15250~well i see what you are talking about but its not that its totally forbidden wpterrorist says if a reliable source describes a person or group using one of these words then the description must be attributed in the article text to its source preferably by direct quotation and always with a verifiable citation. if the term is used with a clear meaning by multiple reliable independent sources then citations to several such sources should be provided in the sentence where it appears. so the issue is one of being absolutely certain that a reliable source described them in this manner. alqueda has an example of this of course theyve been called terrorists by lots and lots of sources probably not the case here... ~0
15251~ive responded to your message at my talk page saying all i could. btw ive gotten a consensus at the wpalbums talk page for what gabemc disputed and ive restored what he removed citing the consensus in my edit summary . i linked gabes name at the talk page where the discussion took place to ping him but he didnt weigh in or anything so a revert shouldnt be expected right? i asked you to stay away from each other so i am not sure this was a smart thing to do.~0
15252~for clarity let me try again my earlier attempts at the top of this page indicates that i have no worries at all discussing the article with neutral people. the requests were posted on the appropriate pages and have driven some attention. i have no concern with repeating that again. my concern is with people who use npov as a pretext to push their agenda. i am ready to discuss the issues with any neutral editor. considering your edits i doubt that the people you are talking about bring any good to this article. for the sake of npov and any other wiki policies or for the sake of common sense of humanity can you explain your reasoning by posting an indictment which proved to be incorrect by the courts to the article. that is a real indictment and it really proved to be incorrect by the real courts. is posting incorrect information your definition of npov? that is what i have some concerns about...~0

15260~objetivist theory of valuethere has to be some merit to objectivism or inventors could never invent anything. if value truly was up to the whims of the buyer you could never know in advance what is going to be considered valuable. but because value is not just a result of the subjective needs of the buyer the inventor can predict in advance tha what he has thought of has value. value is just as much a result of mans use of reason to solve his needs as it is a result of the needs of the buyer.~0
15261~i was just about to issue a final warning before doing so myself. greenock you have been told no with a possibility that it can become a yes. you pointed out that you would agree to any condition and you have been told the conditions but obviously you dont intend to agree with them. this talk page nonsense and your reversion of tfwor has just dissolved any supporting i showed for wpoffer.~0
15262~hi khazarthank you very much it is good to know that there are other wikipedians interested in working on humanrightsrelated articles. if you are interested in more discussion about the she has a name articles tour of she has a name is currently up for featured article candidacy here.~0
15263~sir william lawrence st baronet obviously you may know plenty about this family that i dont but the statement that lawrences father was a member of the fettiplace family must be backed by a reference identifying this particlar lawernce.~0
15264~no i said they were executed and many were wounded as the source clearly states. i also said that hamas claimed at least partial responsibility for the attacks simply because a leader of the organization highlighted its involvement to reassert its control of gaza. your version didnt even mentioned this it just said hamas is suspected of being involved. its more than a different way so stop unnecessary reverts. ~0
15265~peculiar as though the blocking admin was committed to blocking me and was simply setting a series of artificial conditions hoping i would fail one so i could be blocked then blocking me anyway even after the conditions were met~0
15266~i disagree that religious beliefs necessarily conflict with other religious beliefs. i agree that most people will only have one kind of religious belief themself but that doesnt mean to disrespect all other religious groups. actually quite the contrary is true most if not all religions obligate their believers to respect or even love one another independent of their beliefes or ancestries. why bother to contaminate an encyclopedia with religious hatred?~0
15267~you have the option to ignore it at your own peril even get further angry at me and try to act more destructive in vengeance which i hv seen you with other editors but again none of this is going to improve your life. please cast your ego aside take a break from wp for few months refocus on your life resolve all those issues come back as a happy and constructive admin who creates not destroy who leaves positive pshycological footprint.~0
15268~imagedear metsbotwhen i started to upload this image to commons the software told me that an image with the same name already existed there and the thumbnail view it presented was the same image. i did not investigate further and should have.since then i have uploaded the higher resolution image to commons updated the information template to reflect the information that can be found here and now i am here leaving a message about all of this along with an apology.i should have looked more closely at the images and i appreciate a good bot who can and does do this. carol~0
15269~may i compliment youmay i compliment you on what a great job you do on getting the worst most rudest volunteers that instead of helping they just spend there time insulting people they dont even know the person that created this site might consider being more hands on because if i were that person i would be ashamed on what a reck this is turning out to be. you might want to consider volunteer clean up because this site needs people that dont involve their personal life and personal problems such as racism and gossip with professional business i am well aware nobody gets paid to do this job but like they say if your going to do something do it right or dont do it at all~0

15276~reverted changei have reverted your removal of the category from united russia for much the same reason as above. we shouldnt depopulate categories out of process. if one believes that a category or categories is pointless it should be taken to cfd. at a glance it appears that categoryestablishments by country is somewhat established so to depopulate in the way as has been done thus far isnt the way to go about it. take the above linked category to cfd and gain wider community input on the issue particularly as some hold one opinion and others hold another. try it that way instead yeah? im chanting as we speak~0

15283~no what youve done is prove youre clueless. did you read the tag that the administrator put at the top of the page? objections are to go to the discussion page while the page is under construction. stop being a pest. youre not helpingyour grinding your personal axe like an immature little child. and its not me youre embarrassing its yourself. a few of the entries do need citations but links to other wikipedia articles are the citations. do you even remotely understand the concept of branching?one of the reasons the article is being flagged for being too big is that people arent branching to other links where there are citations supporting those particular positions. one doesnt have to reinvent the lightbulb everytime one needs a new lightbulb. i fixed the broken link. and if you had bothered to read the sermon/discussion between branham and billy gramham you would have found in paragraph this trinities statement... jesus come three times. he came the first time to redeem his church. he comes the second time to receive his church. he comes the third time with his church. everything in the bible travels in trinities threes but all in one christ. he... remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church the third time with his church as king and queen.now but on his first coming well speak of just a little bit and then on his being here and then on his second coming on hisand then on the third time if the lord willing.and if i could figure out a way to link directly to that paragraph i would.the problem with branhams statement is that not every triunism is a trinity which is a confusion of terms.scholars also use the term typology but usually only in twos.ill add more references from the thousands of them out there later. you demonstrate your ignorance of the bible and jewish traditions citing that john said jesus went up to the feast of the dedication which is held in the winter i.e. hanukkah is not original research. anyone who knows anything about the bible which you dont knows that the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter is hanukkah. and you dont need citations to cite a statement of fact especially when there is a link to the hanukkah page. citing that john spoke five kingdoms that were one that is etc. is also a statement of fact. and the concept of triunism/trinities/typology is all over christian literature.what is your major malfunction?ike~0

15288~i think masem whom i respect very highly summarized the issue quite well in this comment. if you have the energy id advice to start an tv rfc about how to deal with assumedly somewhatnotable episode articles that violate wpnotplot and where nowhere stands up to fix them. the rfc should be about such articles in general and not just a specific show. many of the hardcore fiction inclusionists/deletionists no longer edit wikipedia and we may actually be getting somewhere with a new attempt. i largely lack the time to actively deal with plotonly fiction articles anymore through merging/redirection but id be very happy to see this issue be resolved in favor of quality instead of fancruft. – t•c~0

15292~you have now been unblocked for for pointing out how elitest the wiki admins are –~0
15293~there were two main reasons why i closed the solid arguments wpsalat and wpnotdirectory. keep but remove red links isnt really a solid rationale it didnt really address the two arguments above. the second keep was stronger but again didnt really address the points above and was more along the lines of wpotherstuffexists. as weer said removing the redlinks would leave a list of five which defeats the object of a list. on the counter side of that argument redlinks show potential for new articles but when there are so many redlinks there is no need for such a list. there were many items on the list yet only a handful were referenced and as another said one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through afd. the strongest keep therefore was wpstand but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. this is the full reason for my close. however deleting admins dont generally say any more than keep or delete in their closing statement unless there is a specific reason for the delete and/or it was a decision that could cause controversy. generally the reasons for delete are ascertainable in the discussion itself. by the way the text is at usergruban/deleted article for your review. best ~0

15300~regarding said agreement those were your stated terms and youre the one who has repeatedly violated your own agreement. pertaining to the external links section they arent endnotes but thats no excuse for deleting important information and using illiterate reference practices. apparently youve never read a scholarly book that had a recommended reading list at the end of a chapter. concerning the deletion of information you deleted the program for st annual workshop on geoethical nanotechnology page and merely left links to the videos hence no one would even know the circumstances of how the video came about or when it was made with jason rennies interview you deleted everything except a link to an archived page which doesnt even have a working link to the audio talk about incompetence and so on it goes. and that doesnt even cover your deletion of the links to full chaptersor in one important case large portions of a relevant chapteravailable for free of the main books referenced in the article. back in january another person ... made an edit getting rid of aforesaid links to the chapters and his edit was quickly reverted by the wikipedia administrator irishguy. your edits show a cavalier disregard for the coherency literacy and usefulness of the content. the effect of your edits is that of one who doesnt have a clueor perhaps carefor what in the world they are doing... ~0

15322~an interesting analogy... by definition of the catholic church the pope is infallible on matters of spirituality. so if the pope were editing the article on the catholic church wouldnt his statements have full authority and accuracy as long as its about matters of faith? i mean really the pope could just issue a proclamation in order to justify any edit he made. i think that such a conflict of interest is a totally bogus idea. i dont claim that im an authoritative source on the same level to msm as the pope is to the catholic church... however i do find that attempting to make such an analogy fails miserably at the purpose intended. ~0
15323~little wobby coords i know its not exactly a reliable source due to dubious stitching of maps however if you view little wobby in google earth you see that little wobby appears in parsley bay which is clearly incorrect. wobby is almost due east of dangar island and it has the tag {{mapitaussuburbscalelong=.lat=.}} versus {{coord..format=dmsdisplay=title}} for little wobby using ltp approximation its m apart which is reaonsable. something is out and im not sure whom but if the reference exists then that would be more correct. how do you get the coords for all these places? some gov. website?~0

15330~re your message i recommend that you recreate the article from scratch. there was very little information beyond his name where his is studying his birthdate which was unsourced a message to his girlfriend which is not appropriate for a wikipedia article and an unlinked reference to the paper you already provided. to establish his notability would require a fundamental rewrite so restoring a copy of the article would not be of much help to you.~0
15331~clearly you havent read wpnpa otherwise you wouldnt have written this. it is difficult to understand why someone interested in jeremy sinden should instead rush across to his far less wellknown brothers article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? the tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a good friend and a fan of marc sinden from the age of when they met on the set of the hey jude video recording. unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucketload of socks to try and support various pov positions and outright puffery of marc sinden and sindenrelated articles. amazingly enough this editor and their socks have added marc sindens name to around articles on wikipedia. for someone whos less notable than my goldfishits certainly true that the jeremy sinden article might lead one here because of course there are no less than three mentions/links to marcus page from there sadly there is not one single link from marcus back to jeremys indeed his name has been expunged completely from the marc sinden article. it seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of jeremys immediately may i therefore suggest you take three actions? . go read wpnpa yet again just in case it hasnt impinged. . add links and content to the marc sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum jeremy sinden because in all the puffery of marc poor jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored. . expand the content of the jeremy sinden article such that it at least matches the marc sinden article because it is a disgrace that the puffedup marc sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the jeremy sinden article when jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable go and put this right. finally as an observation as a contemporary of jeremy you would be around years old it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance and the wisdom of seniors that one might normally expect. may i suggest that you therefore refrain from further conflict and personal attacks and put your editing efforts to work exclusively on the person you do know about? thanks.~0

15333~i shall explain by example... i studied computer science at university college univ oxford. this meant that i was affiliated to univ for all my residential pastoral matters college wide and affiliated to the comlab and maths institute university wide. most of my tutors were maths or professors or postgrads holding fellowships at univ. most of my tutorials and classes were held in univ. sometimes however classes were organised for students of more than one college held at one of those colleges this would generally occur on an adhoc basis. all my lectures were given by comlab/minstitute professors to everyone studying that subject in the university. all exams were set centrally by the comlab/minstitute.not all colleges run all subjects. some colleges are better than others for a subject depending on how many they accept for that subject and who they have teaching it.i hope this helps~0

15337~orchestra page take some time to look at other youth orchestra entries in wikipedia. list of youth orchestras in the united stateslook at some that have clean up notices on them and look at some of the better ones. if you do this you will be better able to judge the content. you may use published sources that are not online. so long as they are reliable and ultimately verifiable by someone who would take the time to look them up to check the information.wikipedia has increased the need for encyclopedic value. older articles that are not verifiable are being removed. the ones that have long standing clean up notices will either be rectified by interested parties or will ultimately be removed. those notices serve to tell the public that the article does not meet the standards of reliability of an encyclopedic article. it appears that the orchestra has been in existence for plus years. it is not an emergency to get an article published. the heading ==acclaim== jumps out as promotional. this is puffery and self aggrandizement. the article must be neutral in tone. the references or footnotes must back up statements in the article. for example use a statement such as the orchestra has been well received by audiences in country a and city b. put in the references. the references themselves may be full of congratulatory language but avoid putting in the article. by way of illustration if a news article from country a said this is the greatest orchestra in the world and got a five minute standing ovation from the audience you would use that as reference with regard to the aforementioned statement but would not put that directly in the article. if the article is in a venue brochure it is of little value but if it is in the country as leading newspaper then it is of value. ask yourself what would make this youth orchestra worthy of mention in an encyclopedia. that critical viewpoint will lead to a better article.~0

15360~== its not emo. ==i had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo only for someone to delete it. stating that it is completely off topic unproductive unrelated to this article and that belongs in a discussion forum hello this is a discussion forum for the emo page if we have an issue with something on it its suppose to be displayed here and talked over. do not delete peoples post because you think it doesnt fit to your standards its for people to talk on.with that i repost my statement to why coheed and cambria are not emo.first off id like to take the time to say. read this and dont reply unless you are agreeing or are going to change this matter. if you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something i dont want to hear it.so here we begin...each song that coheed and cambria has made has gone in flow with a comic that claudio shanchez lead singer has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. well how else would you explain a painful moment or happy moment in a story? a rhyme about whatever the heck junk in a trunk is? no youd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. within the amory wars page the comic made by claudiothe story follows the adventure of claudio kilgannon across the fictional solar system far in the past known as heavens fence in an attempt to seek help from his uncle after his parents are tricked into murdering claudios siblings and then murdered themselves by the supreme trimage and ruler of heavens fence wilhelm ryan.all of their songs came from a point in the story if you had known the story youd not tag them as emo at all. because in fact they are not its a story. get over it and stop with all of this scene stuff. its all a story unlike other bands that cry and scream about i want to die no one understands me i have it so bad my girlfriend left me because i am whinyunderstand what i am pointing out?emo is the most ridiculous label ever yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. so why not research bands before you label. while you are at it read the coheed and cambria comics they are quite the epic. this now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldnt be in this emo label scene. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs doesnt matter if they are or arent emo. theyre listed here as a band that has been called emo. in fact thats the point of the paragraph to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.if you want the related wikipedia guidelines all we have to do is supply a reliable source per wprs that confirms that c have been called emo. source. thats it. thats all we need. any amount of rambling about how they are or arent emo is irrelevant. and you trust mtv? the people that dont even play music anymore pathetic. well i counter your source with mine. source. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs did you really read what i wrote? it doesnt matter if theyre emo or not. were not using c as an example of an emo band were using c as an example of a band thats been called emo. theyve been called emo so theyre mentioned. period.btw click on the tag page of your source. honestly i read it. but i dont give a damn what you wrote. apparently you are one of those i must be right or heaven shall fall type of people. but yet again. so youre making your own rules for wikipedia now? you know the public place? ....cute.but as always there is that one prick in the crowd. you know what though korn sings about sad matters about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them. maybe they should be on that list of exmaples ive heard them be called emo before. this is a retort personally i like korn with that. i am done talking over the matter continue to go on your own about it i wont a~0

15362~ lead is too narrow the lead states adherents of the / truth movement deny that alqaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the world trade center buildings. i think this is too specific as not all proponents argue this. some engineers particularly only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. the use of explosives doesnt preclude alqaeda or anyone else from hijacking or otherwise airliners or aircraft of similar description from intentionally crashing into the wtc. it seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings but that also doesnt preclude the use of explosives. im not a die hard truther but i dont belive the mainstream media or the us government either. as a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by nist and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. calling for further investigation doesnt seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. there seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement. i guess these people who seem to get all their facts from fox and cnn explain why the us government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties patriot ndaa tsa etc. ignorance must surely be bliss for these morons. goodbye ye olde land of the free and the home of the brave.~0
15363~interjection there is a grammatical inconsistency between originally used and refers. since the past tense is correct referred is a better word there. id also like to point out that the part about prof jones is a bit unclear. what experiment did he do that was different from the p/f work? did it involve deuteriumsaturated metal? if so then technically there is little significant difference today cold fusion is basically the description of a proposed explanation for the apparent appearance of heat in experiments that involve deuteriumsaturated metal. believers of course think that the heat is real and the proposal is the correct explanation. ~0
15364~ i think the harcourt article is excellent both because it provides additional context particular in regards to the and weimar law and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument. it is widely accepted harcourt library of congress that the early laws were targeted directly against the nazis and other paramilitary groups that were threatening and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. the government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwi was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare. as late as heinrich bruening attempted to ban the sa and ss see rise and fall of the rd reich ironically setting up the situation that enabled the nazis to legally take control. the subsequent laws enacted by hitler were to a rearm the nazis in particular the private army sas. ensure familiarazation of the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. ensure the disarm all political opponents specifically calling out jews. harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game sure he disagrees with the nras use of nazi imagery in modern debate. yes he says the nazis were not in general pro gun control. both of those prior arguments are straw men which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued the core history which harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to hitler imposed regulations prohibiting jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. the nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons including guns from jewish persons and subsequently engaged in genocide ofthe jewish population or to be sure the nazis were intent on killing jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide. nobody disagrees that hitler armed his private army sa party while disarming the people he was about to exterminate. harcourt discusses this directly as well quoting the nazi minister of the interior “if these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the national socialist state possess any weapons then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the weapons law for the population faithful to the state. to saulwpfringe you keep using that word. i do not think it means what you think it means. /saul what part is fringe? that the nazis implemented gun control? that the gun control specifically targeted jews? that there are a plethora of memos diaries and documents saying go attack the jews they are disarmed so you shouldnt have any resistance? that the jews were later exterminated? please identify the specific facts which you think are fringe. ~0

15369~while i take your recommendation to heart i have to insist that by any plain reading of wpnfcc the image is keepable. lets look at the test in nfcc evaluate this imagenonfree content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose.no free equivalent could be created to show what berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at or so no matter how we approach him as a yearold antichild pornography speaker educator. if nonfree content can be transformed into free material this is done instead of using a fairuse defense.the only way i could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask berry to permit its release under gfdl. permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be to my mind cruel even to ask berry about it.nonfree content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. acceptable quality means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose.there is no freer equivalent available berry will never be a teenager again and since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think.as a quick test ask yourself can this image be replaced by a different one while still having the same effect? if the answer is yes then the image probably does not meet this criterion.as the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time. it is intrinsically true that berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites. the only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the facts berrys image then and let the reader draw their own conclusion. what say you? no free equivalent. nonfree content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose. if nonfree content can be transformed into free material this is done instead of using a fairuse defense. nonfree content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. acceptable quality means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose. as a quick test ask yourself can this image be replaced by a different one while still having the same effect? if the answer is yes then the image probably does not meet this criterion.~0
15370~i have read the wikipedia rules a few times and as far as i can find it says all reliable sources are by definition both published and accessible to at least some people. sources that are not published e.g. something someone said to you personally or not accessible e.g. the only remaining copy of the book is locked in a vault with no one allowed to read it are never acceptable as sources on wikipedia. in my interpretation i can refer to jahre handel und kultur im ostseegebiet gotland perle der ostsee isbn as far as i can see this book qualifies. if you accept this we can go further. if you search isbn on google you will get results openfuture does not accept this. are you reading the rules in the same way? ~0

15393~ climate data an unregistered editor keeps adding climate data to the article but i have removed it because it isnt clear where the data has been gathered. the unregistered editor has provided a source for the data but i am yet to be convinced that that source can be considered reliable and anyway it also very clearly states that the climate profile is taken from closest available data source to north chideock which is not the same as stating the data was gathered actually in chideock. it is quite likely the data was gathered at a weather station such as on the isle of portland or at yeovilton in somerset and because of this i consider it misleading to the reader to present the info in the article as if it applied specifically to addition some of the text added by the unregistered editor was not supported by the source for example the claim that chideock is one of the sunniest places in the uk. this statement may be correct but it is not supported by the source. ~0

15400~you raise a lot of interesting issues. ill give my thoughts on some of them. first i think youre right that eric is at least in some sense more readable. second youre right that we have article titles like eric i of norway and eric vi of sweden but also eirik ii of norway so its not quite consistent. i think that a high level of anglicization is expected for the names of royalty where familiar names tend to be used if at all available. if eiríkr hákonarson had ever called himself king i would be fine with having his article at eric ii of norway. but he wasnt quite royalty and he is a somewhat more obscure historical character than the kings so im not quite sure how to apply this. as for medieval usage i havent made a complete study but what ive seen so far is that the latin charters witnessed by eiríkr during his life have yric dux most commonly or yrric dux or iric dux. the encomium emmae written in latin in or has the form eric and titles him as dux et princeps provintiae quae nordwega dicitur.the anglosaxon chronicle written in old english of course has irke a dative form or yric or yrice a dative form or eiric. maybe i missed a variant.old norse texts are usually published in normalized orthography where the name is eiríkr. in diplomatic editions you will probably find forms like eirikr or eiricr or eirijkr but i dont have any at hand at the moment so dont take it as gospel.ive got to run now will address the rest of the question later. im actually more worried about the patronym ~0

15429~ facts i think im finally starting to get the hang of this finding of fact malarkey brad.the scenario bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called nina green banned from wikipedia. when bishonen realises that nina green is indeed going to be bannedshe posts to the arbcom page in green text fof perfectly normal. arbcom pages are like little rainbows.at the end of a talk page post about the green text bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as dye fof not at all forced or contrived. lots of people refer to text as dye. or if they dont they should do.bishonen ends her post with green dye which reads as green die fof pure coincidence. nina green couldnt have been further from bishonens mind when she wrote green dye. bishonen hadnt though of nina green for at least seconds.fof this entire sequence events bishonen wants nina banned gets what she wants posts in green text decides to call text dye and ends her post for no apparent reason with green dye is just a random bubble of billiontoonecoincidence. bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with blue pigment.yep. i think ive got this fof thing now. and it certainly makes it a lot easier to understand how arbcom arrives at its decisions. ~0

15443~your welcome to rebut away. first off goodday you seem to have a dislike for anything other than english being on wikipedia even though there is no english equivalent word as shown in this diff. you were told by almost everyone an alternative name in english could not be used as there were none. now that is a shut and closed case as the votes proved. i believe you were the only one other than the proposer who agreed to move the article name. your only reply was that you werent going to change your mind. i cant understand why you didnt understand the reasoning for not changing. is it because you are stubborn perhaps? i noticed before you saying similar things at different articles. perhaps it is because you are too stubborn. i would rather that than think you just dislike every language other than english. secondly and this one is close to my heart im starting to think you continually and without being encouraged in any way enjoy telling scots welsh and english people that you only look on them as british whether or not they self identify as scots/welsh or english. you even brought your last discussion on it from elonkas talk page just to get it up and running. even going so far as to question whether scotland should have their own football league participating in europe. you then go on to say that you know nothing of football which makes me wonder why you would comment on something you know nothing about. all this makes me wonder why? is it because you srongly believe that quebec should not be independent from canada and your bringing your unionist view onto the uk article? of course there is one way for me to avoid all this on your talkpage and thats to take it off my watchlist and ive already done that. you are still welcome on mine even if i will no longer post on yours.~0

15448~oops i think im seeing the issue and it is indeed my error. somehow i missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it. i have struck my comment above and in the future i wont mention it again unless its relevant to acknolwedge my previous error. my apologies.i would argue however that incidence which relates to new appearances of did in the community at large isnt a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence. i suggest using a subheading with both ==incidence and prevalence== though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology. the wpmedmosdiseases or disorders or syndromes doesnt give much guiance here bar noting that ==epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information no mention of subsections. usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out which is itself dependent on the sources. ive replaced the section heading but both i and p. the section overall needs fleshing out with more sources which i think are unfortunately lacking. searching on pubmed for did and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic. t c wikipedias rulessimple/complex again my apologies for the error the fault was completely mine.~0
15449~ just a question hii dont want to impose too much but im curious did you actually read the article that started the altercation between me and medeis or did you just look at the links he provided to his own talk page? i fully admit that i was being mildly insulting. i can also assure you that i could have done much better at being insulting if i had put the effort into it. medeis himself has also proven himself capable of insults as you can see by browsing his talk page and then looking up the other side. one particularly inelegant response to somebody who did not agree with him was hah ha ha ha ha ha eh hm. huh hah ha ha ha hah. but he seems to have developed a habit of threatening all kinds of things if his own hide is pierced.hes new ill grant that. but if you want to know what the fuss was about it started right here pama–nyungan languages. he seems to be reverterincharge of that page. by his own admission he knows nothing about the subject. neither do i as a matter of fact but there are a couple of things that i am aware of in this field and one of them is that the current orthodoxy is still in its hypothesis stage.take a look if youre interested in australian languages but beware of the articles bias this bias is what started it all.as for me and medeis i suspect youd rather prefer never to have known about us at all.all the best ~0

15453~according to your logic reverting vandalism would be disruptive too and should lead to blocking. i think the problem here is that like many admins you barely contribute to wikipedia and care little about its content. you are mainly a janitor and policeman and tend to develop a janitors and a policemans attitude. it is an issue of systemic bias. ordinary users tend to have an editors attitude i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible and not accept other peoples bad edits.your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy. oh i do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length look at this for example but i am under no illusions that people like you or eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument. at the end of the day the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content. this is my observation after long examination of wikipedia.in the specific case of me versus eiorgio your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that i only discussed in the edit summaries. in reality i tried to reason with him on his talk page but he simply deleted all my comments showing he had no interest in debating it.your mention of sockpuppetry is fantasy and a straw man. please do not introduce irrelevant insulting concepts into the discussion. with as much validity i could warn you to make sure that tawker is not your goodcop/badcop sockpuppet.since you enjoy linking to policy with which i am in most cases more familiar than you have a look at wpsock wprr wpdick and a few more. —  ✉ ~0

15499~ questions about a certain reversion edit i have some questions about this edit. i did not remove the character string that supposedly is the title. that is the string that is the title according to the edit comment which says um no the title is the line above that. on the other hand this edit see above did remove the character string that imho was a better title. that is the string that i thought was better as all or part of a title for the web page with the url of . i am not immediately ready to insist that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice. however if you have any comments about that idea i am willing to listen. i am prepared to try to reach some consensus. is there anything we can do to explore or discuss or explain to each other the goals that are perhaps to be achieved by choosing well and carefully which character string to use as the title? or maybe that should say << the goals that are more nearly to be achieved >> by doing so ? . would it benefit anyone perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals? if one of us were to explore or discuss or explain the reasons why the use of the character stringsabal adanson ex guersent bulletin des sciences par la societe philomatique. . for the title would be better? do we both understand thoroughly and well what each word of that title means and what its role is in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for? such as describing the topic of a certain web page and informing the reader a little bit what a certain web page is about ? do we both or do any of us think that this titlesabal adanson ex guersent bulletin des sciences par la societe philomatique. . comes closer to describing the topic of the web page or otherwise in some sense doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is /slash should be helpful for? have both of us sufficiently considered the question of what the web page with the url of value of the url field is about? imho it comes pretty close to being about palmetto. i could be wrong... i hope this does not sound too negative. i hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something that is not already known at least something that we dont both already know. so maybe there is hope for a happy winwin outcome that will be the best for all concerned. it would even be fine with me if after reaching some consensus successfully we were to nuke this whole section if e.g. we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any archive files. no harm / no foul. getting in to history logs or remaining in them might be a different matter. you are welcome btw to answer some questions that i did not know to ask. if any. the kindness of a response and/or an edit that restores the word palmetto would be appreciated. thank you. ~0

15512~ ants evolved... as a statement of fact. i was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this articleants evolved from wasplike ancestors in the midcretaceous period between and million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.also perhaps this statement should begin with the words many experts believe... or evidence suggests... etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... this brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science. i think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that havent been statistically proven which points out several flaws in the statement. evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps but them first appearing the the midcretaceous period is hard to statistically prove. i suppose this should be changed if im right but i may not be. talk the cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. the sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between to million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence. very true. talk ants where do ants mate.how long do they live.do they have sex. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... heh viable question. this spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and i did some rewriting. it should be doublechecked for good measure. the article answers these well enough. ants live varied amounts of time depending on many things. some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that years. talk common ants varieties there is almost no mention of little black ants or red ants in this article. i see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them.im not sure where you are but if its europe then those guys are probably lasius niger and myrmica rubra. they arent common everywhere. user~0

15533~ edit request from jayjoanz february please add the following information to the public image section of lady gagas pagelady gagas public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. the pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. her . million twitter followers and . million facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product hampp . with opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music fashion and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality hampp .works citedhampp andrew. gaga oooh la la why the lady is the ultimate social climber. advertising age . . communication mass media complete. ebsco. web. feb. . i think that section already basically says that. also we dont list how many twitter followers and facebook followers a person has because theres no way to really verify that information are those real people? are there any sockpuppet accounts? anyway the article basically says all that already. drugtaking? shouldnt something be said about her drug taking. she admitted it on her cbs minutes interview that she smokes a lot of pot while writing music while drinking whiskey. its mentioned on other musicians articles so why not here? ... im surprised her former cocaine habit isnt mentioned here as well seeing as shes talked about it in multiple places now minutes vanity fair. ... edit request from cvachov february – early lifelady gaga was born stefani joanne angelina germanotta to an italian american family in new york city on march ...in yonkers. ny...yonkers is its own city and not part of new york city it is located in westchester county not one of the five boroughs. per the cited source birth place new york ny. it does not state yonkers. if you check the talk page history youll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end and established consensus is that she was not born in yonkers. — talk early management requested addition frank fredericks a fellow freshman at nyu recognized stefanis talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show. fredericks began managing stefani in the spring of booking her shows at the nearby club the bitter end. they worked together for over year until she began working with producer rob fusari.sources lady gaga jewish i dont have a link but she is jewish. ... ok please come back when you have a link that meets wpblp talk to me no she is not. she is of italian descent and was raised roman catholic and she also attended a catholic school. she is not jewish. she is catholic and the article already has sources stating so. userwillth~0

15550~pnrs human. pnrs human. pnrs>human. the only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the realworld thing it was supposed to analogize. it isnt that we have detected pnrss twice and found they were generated by humans therefore the third pnrs we detect is probably human. rather the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several pnrss and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. somewhere in the id article it says that id is not meant to replace insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. those are pnrss that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars not alien lifeforms. the flagella on bacteria is just another pnrs in this analogy. and while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet we have several other complex pnrss that we know were created naturally so rather than leap to the conclusion that a designer created flagella science says no further information known. theres a concept that feels like you arent grasping here science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. but just because something is unknown doesnt mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical observable repeatable knowledge. and thats worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries even though when the first natural scientists came about they knew practically nothing and everything was unknown from a rigorous scientific point of view. if one were to look at id from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent id is so impatient to know that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like legitimate possibility or probable explanation. science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon. ~0

15590~jon martinhi. while its great that you want to contribute to wikipedia there is a whole host of problems with your article which you might want to consider. first you have eliminated the redirect to another page but havent put in a hatnote or anything that will indicate to the reader where that page is. but the main problem is that there are no reliable source references that either establish the subjects notability or support any of the text that is written. the official website blog twitter etc none of those count. there have to be independent thirdparty sources about the guy otherwise the whole thing will get deleted. i suggest you get onto that as soon as you can. let me know at my talk page if you have any questions. cheers~0

15618~vcard wikiengine i where reading tom limoncelli time management for system administrators where he mentioned about using wikiengine as a registry for contact information. then i started to wonder in my small round head about contact format.vcard sounds quite natural way to save this kind of information. which leads simply to question how hard it could be to make some notation for contact information when there is way to say this is name this field is phone number of that previously mentioned name being and so on. if there is notation how to express something then it is quite simple to output vcard hcard or html table etc. contact information should be reusable from many different wiki page. i mean that if theres article about hp computer and other about hp printers contact to hp should be single hp contact object.unfortunately i dont have glue how code extensions to wiki. i also dont know how much there is contact information in wikipedia most likely only some. if there would be notation for addresses phone number etc would anyone use it. impossible to say. there is also other side of coin. it might be that implementation of contact information notation is just what everybody needed but did not realize needing it. there is also possibility that this idea was completely stupid actually my ideas usually are not so bright than i self think they are.sami kerola~0

15623~ mass movement of turks into central anatolia is an unsourced statement from a wiki article so i am not sure if its worth discussing the article i cited above disputes that. if there was a massive wave of newcomers there should be genetic evidence. also considering the byzantine empire of the comnens th century covered about half of anatolia i doubt the biggest areal turkish language spread happened from th to th in the anatolian area. i dont think critical mass is a meaningful concept here. as don ringe put it history shows that comparatively small groups of immigrants can induce their new neighbors to adopt their language — gradually over several generations of course — if they have enough economic or political power and they can offer some important advantage to those who are willing to adopt their language. so its not just a question of numbers. of course there are some speakers someone has to speak the new language first ~0

15626~if the imf no longer uses the in transition group it must mean that they feel it no longer reflects a significant economic difference. to see if this is true i have plotted the pppbased per capita gdp of various countries. the data comes from the april imf world economic update. the countries classified by the imf as advanced economies are in dark blue the countries designated by the cia world factbook as in transition are in light blue except for slovenia which is now classified as advanced the countries designated as least developed by the un are in red and the remaining countries are in orange. as you can see the group of advanced economies is distinguished by their high gdp/capita and the group of least developed countries by their low gdp/capita but there is nothing to clearly distinguish the in transition countries from the others. }}classifications by the imf and the unsince the in transition classification is no no longer used by the imf and appears not to be useful i suggest that it should be dropped from the map. also it would be better to use current data for the lists of advanced and least developed countries instead of the obsolete data used by the cia world factbook. i have prepared a possible replacement map on the left. it shows all countries classified by the imf as advanced in blue. the other countries designated by the imf to be emerging and developing economies are in red for those classified as least developed by the un and orange for those not so classified. ~0

15645~credible authorhello. a credible authors reference is being overrided by editwarring. i recently tried to add to the telescope article but this seems to think that his opinion overrides a very credible author in mr. richard powers. ive been blocked before for editwarring recently so i dont want this to be another incident on my record. anyway the other editor seemed to have asked his friendtype editors to form a consensus so i will do the same. the islamic connection here is alhaytham. he is fundamental to the telescope and the father of optics. by definition the summary can include him since the radio and electromagnetic telescopes are derogatory to the average person looking at the article i wanted to add it to the history section since it looked cleaner. can you help your fellow internethero?? ~0
15646~it is about buoyancy which is about the weight of the fluid volume displaced not about the weight of the displacing object. in the case of lead in water the bouyant force is equal to the weight of the water volume displaced which is far less than the weight of the lead and the lead sinks. and mountains do sink into the mantle until the buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced mantle volume equals the weight of the mountain.~0

15649~i think part of wikipedia is defining what a term means many words are used in many different ways. i remember ethnic group being a pretty vague term before wikipedia was around. everyone uses the word evolution in a different way. i dont believe in correct definitions so much as consistent and useful ones. i propose we adopt the following evolution umbrella term any change over time as stated in first sentence of article. natural selection horizontal gene transfer etc... mechanisms which explain evolution the observation. theories of evolution a theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history e.g. out of africa theory cretaceous–paleogene extinction eventthe other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life. as opposed to evolution per sethe precambrian rabbit wouldnt falsify evolution so much as discredit all of our current theories about evolution. what do we think?~0

15677~heading. my common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something or the study thereof. my own dictionary says demographics data resulting from the science of demography and demography the scientific study of human populations especially with relation to their size structure and distribution. so on that basis the articles would be correctly titled demographics of... and quote lots of statistics. it would appear to me that according to my quite large dictionary the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. at the least it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.my own interest was how broad the term demographics is and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area climate how wet it is all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. i suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information. i completely agree with you dictionary. however the key phrase is the scientific study of human populations. once human population is no longer an essential part of the study as in climate landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population it is no demography i do agree that if climate has an effect on the population e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold it is interesting from demography but without such reference not. nonfamiliesi notice that a lot of wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories had children under the age of living with them were married couples living together had a female householder with no husband present and nonfamilies. these categories do not add up to % for examples see downers grove willowick ohio etc etc. any ideas about where this came from and how it can be addressed? it seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. novickas generational cohortsare those born during the brief period generationless?thats exactly what i was thinking whats the deal?? ill quote belowgeneration x cohort born from to memorable events challenger explosion irancontra social malaise reaganomics aids safe sex fall of berlin wall single parent families key characteristics quest for emotional security independent informality entrepreneurial generation y cohort also called n generation born from to seems to be years through are wandering generation lost. i was recently at a business conference and they where talking about the generations and they referred to the n generation as the milenials or the milenial generation those who havent known a time before the computer~0

15682~the facts for anyone that has further trouble with troublemakers as i have consider the following from the wikipedia rules such as in your rebuttal or just ignore themmaking bold edits wikipedians often make sweeping changes to pages in order to improve them most of us aim to be bold when updating articles. while having large chunks of text youve written removed or substantially rewritten can be frustrating simply making edits that noticeably alter the text or content of a pages should not be immediately labeled vandalism.talk page vandalism removing the comments of other users from talk pages other than your own aside from removing internal spam vandalism etc. is generally considered vandalism. removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long talk page by creating an archive page and moving the text from the main talk page there. the above rules do not apply to a users own talk page where this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the users discretion. please note though that removing warnings from ones own talk page is often frowned upon.~0

15700~please stop vandalising this article valentinian. the reason to keep this addition in the article is very simple mr. rasmussens comments to not step in and suppress freedom of press caused an international uproar amongst muslims and thus in my opinion it is a very important part of his premiership. i will once again edit this into the article. should you want to reword it be my guest. however do not delete it again. the ambassadors of muslim countries called on anders fogh rasmussen the prime minister to take necessary steps against the defamation of islam. ~0

15702~oooh youre wrong youre wrong youre wrong. why am i not impressed by your debate skills. first until weeks ago i had never heard the term meat puppet. perhaps youre trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean no more and no less. shades of alice in wonderland i suppose. i will have to find the definition of that term. but i view it as a problem when selfselected biased individuals even if there is no actual coordination involved seem to coordinate their postings. dodo ran away thats a fact. he didnt address my actual criticisms of his actions he simply threw a few templates as if that was the end of the argument. but those templates were not merely misapplied they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute. dodo couldnt be bothered to address them and for a good at least for him reason if dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct and debate the propriety not merely of the original post but also his own misdeeds then dodo would be so busy he couldnt continue his driveby reversions of peoples articles. dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits repeatedly. he was unwilling to explain why he didnt wait for consensus. etc.and it is a fact that nobody addressed dodos at least arguable misconduct even if hypothetically they also objected to something i did too. why should that be? theres an excellent reason i think the kind of people who did post selfselected of course one would expect may very well have felt they were defending one of their own. i repeat my point that if i had time and access to reversion/deletion statistics it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of dodo revert revert revert and not to bother with any consensus. we dont need no stinkin consensus. such persons would be fearful of outing dodos pattern of action and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism. am i wrong? i invite somebody else to study their statistics and explain why theres no pattern there. ~0

15728~l uk credits ==on hir talk page melbournestar has an exchange of messages in which s/he accepts that the credits for episodes of l uk serve as sufficient sources to establish the relationship between the original l episodes and their uk remakes. there is no rational reason why those same credits do not serve as sufficient sourcing for the same information in this article. melbournestar specifically and unequivocally states that no additional citation is needed when the credits of the uk episode state that the episode is based on a us episode. demanding additional sourcing on this article when s/he has already acknowledged that it is not necessary is irrational. please stop reverting the information in support of irrationality. ... melbournestar has now stated on hir talk page that s/he is making this change in an attempt to prove a point about this article and similar articles. ... ah no im clearly just saying once this is past ill move back onto the bigger article which is l uk. just because i say i agree does not mean i agree. what i still find so hilarious is that youd rather violate rr and personal attack another user then going ahead with consensus or providing a reliable source. youve done neither and to make things better ill promise you that i wont leave until either is reached. all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable published source using an inline citation. wikipediaverifiabilitywikipedia does not publish original thought all material in wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable published source. wporwikipedia articles should be based on reliable published secondary sources and to a lesser extent on tertiary sources. secondary or tertiary sources are needed to establish the topics notability and to avoid novel interpretations of primary sources though primary sources are permitted if used carefully. all interpretive claims analyses or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source rather than original analysis of the primarysource material by wikipedia editors. wpordo not base articles entirely on primary sources wpor i may have accepted the credits on the l uk article before i took a read of this. talk to me == ~0

15731~﻿sensual pleasures of the minditalic textthere are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. money can’t buy it you can’t see it or hold it outerpackaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within. it is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. it is born there and lives there.since it is a feeling rather than a physical event it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences. knowledge intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. a conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind. all of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. there are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. emotional buttons pushing those buttons engenders our partners sensory and sexual experience. we do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge intuition and creativity an individual possesses. nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s. it’s freelance flight.knowledge is power getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. the ability tounearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reactionindicating you have your finger on a button hot spot. finding all of those buttons exploring the endless possibilities anddiscovering the wondrous places they lead takes patience and thought but the rewards are immeasurable.having well honed intuition is a valuable asset. liken it if you will to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. if you ‘know’ what your partner needs wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all then you hold a powerful advantage. possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex in general offers a continual win win propositionbeing gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. if they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. if it wasnt good the first time why would anyone want to repeat it? taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. that is the stuff heroes are made of.sexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation sexual pleasures or through mind play and manipulation a physical presence a verbal exchange a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’ a place of arousal and euphoria.sensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. rituals and sensual tasks while away from yourpartner can help keep the buttons pushed the bond strong keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on anongoing basis. keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.altered states....sexuality.....intensely turned on riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passionendorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful placenirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through losing oneself......total freedom through total loss of control.all sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe.~0

15748~== art of war ==thanks for being so understanding. i hope you decide to stick around. regarding the art of war disambiguation there is already a link to suntzus book which el norte press has simply issued in a new edition. wpdisambig covers the sorts of things that are appropriate for disambiguation pages since we wouldnt have a whole article on a single edition of a book we wouldnt mention it on the disambiguation page. but please feel free to contribute to wikipedia in other ways. and ironic as it might sound now ignore all rules if you do something wrong someone else will come along and fix it talkcontribs ah i had missed that you had said maos art of war not sun tzus. still mao never wrote a book called the art of war. the el norte press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises. they would be notable individually but none would be linked to the art of war disambiguation page since none of them shares that title nor could the el norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises e.g. on protracted war. talkcontribs there is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of wpn and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book. a more specific notability guideline is available at wpnb. since the art of war disambiguation is not a heavilyedited page leaving this to another editor to correct does not seem likely to resolve this problem. if you like you can request a third opinion which would bring others into the discussion. talkcontribs thanks for your note. while anything written by mao zedong would count as notable a collection of his writings assembled under a title that he never chose would not be. it is for this reason that i am loathe to include the art of war as one of maos writings or to put it on the disambiguation page. one thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers. that would be a sign of notability. did mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title the art of war? who has discussed the works by this title? talkcontribs thank you again for your comments. the fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable blogs are not reliable sources either. you mention that this book is used at west point. i would correct you to say that this edition has been ordered by the west point bookstore the book in question does not exist — except as a creation of el norte press. you mention your expertise expert editors addresses this issue so we dont have to throw our credentials on the table. if you wish to pursue this further the link for a third opinion is above. talkcontribs art of war by mao zedong dispute summary of third opinionany works attributed by mao zedong mao tsetung not already indexed specifically should be considered notable and deserving of a reference line as long as they are verified. the editor asking for the inclusion has made an argument for notability. the art of war community should decide on any future postings regarding this book.i have reinstalled the reference to the art of war by mao zedong mao tsetung on the art of war disambiguation page.this is the only dispute in queue a~0

15766~thanks for the suggestion... re friends episodes articles.i used the capitals used in the main list of friends episodes page where prior editors capitalized all the first letters of the titles. i totally agree with your point though. i will take some time to format these correctly as well.as for the debate about having an article for each episode i have looked for episode summaries for friends before and they are not very in depth. what i was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular summary format. as another example considering the legacy of star trek and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the net i think the wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job. im even using the little nav table i am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate whats already available out there.~0

15802~one can insert in context a cost at one point. for instance the onetimebuy of ma rifles by the us army was for a unit cost of $. even then contracts are not exact either. a contract can have penalties incentives delivery costs support costs development costs and an absurd array of factors which make any one number meaningless. take the b if youre fond of aircraft. prices for individual planes hovered between $m and $.b depending on who you asked. prices when they included the cost of development and support infrastructure have topped $ billion. thats a lie of course. if you were to have added one bomber to the end of the production run it would have cost around $m extra. is that the actual cost of the bomber then? ~0
15803~reduce precision?i reduced the precision in the table but i wonder if we could reach a consensuos here on these infoboxes. or should i revert? the mos says avoid overprecise values where they are unlikely to be stable or accurate or where the precision is unnecessary in the context. the speed of light in a vacuum is metres per second is probably appropriate but the distance from the earth to the sun is kilometres and the population of cape town is would usually not be because both values are unstable at that level of precision and readers are unlikely to care in the context. im guessing that this was reached after the template was created and the template now conflicts with wiki polocy.~0

15826~ i am against the idea of including the names in the article. this is an online petition. anyone could put down any name in it so the credibility is not very high unless theres another way of verifying that the signed individuals did it on their own and not of others. talk page ~0
15827~content dispute whispertome and eye smith are having a dispute about the content of this article on eye smiths talk page. its one thing to resolve a minor dispute about an article on an editor talk page but this is much more than a minor dispute. other editors should have an opportunity to weigh in. please discuss the article here.~0

15831~my concern about your username admiinship is no big dealhello and thank you for contributing to wikipediai hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome but i noticed your username and am concerned that it might not meet wikipedias username policy. after you look over that policy could we discuss that concern here?id appreciate learning your own views for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.you have several options freely available to you if you can relieve my concern through discussing it here i can stop worrying about it. if the two of us cant agree here we can ask for help through wikipedias dispute resolution process such as asking for a third opinion or requesting comments from other wikipedians. admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process. you can keep your contributions history under a new username. visit wikipediachanging username and follow the guidelines there.let me reassure you that my writing here means i dont think your username is grossly blatantly or obviously inappropriate such names get reported straight to wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism wpaiv or blocked on sight. this is more a case where opinions might differ and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at wprfc/name. so i look forward to a friendly discussion and to enjoying your continued participation on wikipedia. thank you again addict addict ~0
15832~very soon we all will find more about who you are.... public statement by mark bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleaguesyou continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the los angeles times. why? instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. you are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me mark bellinghaus. i have never had a dispute with brandon james since i have not contacted him as he claimed in the article published by the oc register. they also published other lies which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. i will file a protest with wikipedia because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. this article is literally a stage for book projects such as june dimaggios and jeanne carmens.maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind delicious carbuncle?again i knew that i would become the target of the criminals who i stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks attached to the legacy of marilyn monroe. but i will use my clear and given right to defend what we three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.the la times articles must be added to this article and the citizen is a dead blog which was a favor/favour posted by a friend this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up of kenneth knoll the friend and manager of the june dimaggio book project. she quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is not a press agency or journalist.regarding the brandon james claims which you willingly added. i have never spoken to brandon james ever since i was introduced to him and his mother in . he followed me to every blog every website. attacked us hidden behind monikers.what is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.it is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. who is behind this? we do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.and that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.it has also to do with cyber bullying since i am being portrayed as a monster. i am being compared to charles manson and berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in malaysia. these people want me to go the megan meier way. they have already told me to kill myself. not once but twice. they have called me a pedophile and other insults. they have claimed that i made bomb threats when i have never ever threatened anyone. at all. i have never extorted anyone. you people hiding behind your funny and also so believable names you know why you are doing this and why you are using wikipedia to destroy my name completely. when i protested on the th anniversary of marilyn monroes death outside the chapel i had my reason. three people were threatened and harassed by the monroe version gang of people who threatened me to come to my home tie me on a chair duct tape me and steal my collection. they were not shy to even include the aids infected blood by one of the members. one of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation that this female from canada a woman which i have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created have thought out these many frauds hoaxes crimes.i am asking you that if you decide to keep this site up and going not to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. i never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history but it did.success so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. jealousy is one thing but facts and achievements are another.it is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that mark bellinghaus mentally ill and other worse things and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known lori drew manner. but it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website which is nothing else than the revenge of a group~0

15848~== slow film == regina viarum queen of the roads.i spotted this image and caption in our rome article today and thought ‘that the reminds me of the long opening tracking shot in caro diario’. i am probably quite wrong but if the movie does begin on the via appia i would think it worth mentioning. come to that anyone who has seen the movie recently or has the dvd might write something on that opening sequence it seemed to me to define the tone of the film rather beautifully yes this is going to be a road movie but a slow slow movement road movie. — ~0
15849~ argument without end citations are historical transposition? theres something in the diem era section stating that mcnamara wrote x about motivations in argument without end. i would be leery of ascribing this as a contemporary statement in the s which is what the phrase indicates because mcnamara wrote the book in one of several he wrote on vietnam long after the fact. its obviously important as is the other work but i think it benefits from hindsight more than being reliable to the times and i would rather see it placed in its own legacy/criticism/whatever section than being used as a reliable historical source for this article. ~0

15853~unmoved i undid your move of the privatmusings thread to a subpage. it would make more sense if the thread is too long to split the new material into a new thread rather than to move it to a subpage that no one will look at. lar put it on the an/i to generate more exposure to the issue. ·· ··~0

15855~why should anyone do such a thing?~0
15856~look the thing is and im not being arrogent here i have been dabbling in gas lately and have looked at a bunch of others which i havent touched. it doesnt have to be perfect cause i know its not just good. and i know the things needed the other bunch of stuff with the lead is redundent as a bunch of ga and ive seen one on fac not having links in lead. however if you look at the review im not familiar with whitewash or madienin a sporting context for both as i know the historical context to whitewash sorry but we may differ here on views but this is not wikipedia for the specials. also i am an accedmic undergrade so i know all about dumbing down to a point but linking basic terms for a non english speaker thats a bit too far especially since this is and encyclopeia for english speakers. if your reading it and review it then a comprensable level of english would be presumed by even the most unassuming english native. personally i do not want to stick with what he has said and rather have a clean break and have a restarted review by someone with a capable level of english.~0

15860~page moves this is the second time that you have been warned about page moves creating double redirects. please pay attention to what you are doing and clean up after yourself. it is annoying enough to have to clean up after vandals without having to clean up after people trying to contribute to the project. the page move screen prompts you with a handy link to check for double redirects because it saves time if you do this instead of waiting for someone else to clean up your mess. —•talk~0

15866~my complaint is that a change that you correctly identify as obvious is still not made because of the bias and special relationship which you and slrubenstein appear to have. if you make it this difficult to change something so obviously biased i dread to think what it would be like to bring this article to neutrality. my complaint is therefore that in my opinion you are biased and using your administrative tools to promote that bias a neutral party would have made the change instead of wasting my time here. it is unacceptable that a partisan vets every edit.~0
15867~republic or fairuse images from websites of rd parties in referrence to what you said on the image talk page work of the u.s. government is in the public domain since its paid for with our tax dollars. since what you mentioned is a navy photo just add this tag {{pdusgovmilitarynavy}} to the images description. in regards to fair use on videogame screenshots that information is found on the use page. if you have trouble finding the correct image tags in the future try searching for articles that will have similar images in this case aircraft carrier or grand theft auto to see what tags they used. hope that helps.~0

15876~totalitarianism at wikipedia note that this user is practicing totalitarianism at wikipedia. this does not constitute a personal attack on jza but stems from the fact that s/he is involved in edit warring and executing administerial privileges without engaging in dialogue. s/he is undermining wikipedia and for one has turned me off of wkipedia. clearly s/he has declared by these practices that the pages dealing with united kingdom are off limit for anyone who is interested in improving them. despite the badges and notices on her/his home page jza is evidently not intersted in the integrity of wikipedia but simply involved in maintaining her/his own territory. ...~0

15878~ only after excommunication the article currently states that people are rebaptized only after entering the church again after excommunication. this is not always true. in addition to rebaptism after removal of ones name from church records a bishop may approve a rebaptism for a token of repentance rather than merely membership in the church. a reference we had a wonderful older brother in my branch with a gambling addiction. when he was finally able to overcome it and despite no official church punishment he petitioned for and was granted rebaptism to witness again to his god his church his family and maybe most importantly himself that he was born again. technically all this good brother needed was the sacrament of the lords last supper but cant you imagine how much more staying power the sacrament of baptism and rebirth has had on his determination? this administrative action was instituted iirc in the late s or mid s. it is distinct from excommunication. prior to this being available however a person had to be voluntarily excommunicated in order to remove that persons name from church records but this is no longer the case.~0
15879~total energy so renewable energy in the country accounts for roughly how much % of the total energy produced? if someone can get some figures for renewable energy and total energy that would be great. as an example the opening paragraph of this wikipedia article states the following renewable energy in the united states accounted for . percent of the domestically produced electricity in and . percent of total energy generation.~0
15880~admitting as a prime number messes up all these theorems which otherwise have simple statements. if the messing up accomplished something of real value it would be all right. by this i mean that if the explanations had to be complicated in order to help people understand some subtle point that was of real interest that would be all right. but in these examples and many others the additional complication introduced by admitting as a prime number does not lead anyone to any better understanding of what is going on.~0

15890~just to clarify. if we go by the historical classification we have the following declension classes for strong nounsmasculine a wa ia ja i and ustems plus a few relics of consonant stems.feminine ō wō jō iō and istems plus a few irregularities leftovers from the consonant classes and the word hönd which is the sole feminine survivor of the uclass..neutral a wa ia and jastems plus the relic fé uclass.those are all declension classes. the weak nouns then have a system of their own.i hope this answered the question. regarding the article when and how it is suffixed is another chapter. all the best~0
15891~comment ... and none which actually flat out say waterboarding is not torture. youre lying. both congressman poe and congressman tancredo have said flat out that waterboarding is not torture. in a survey % of the american people have said flat out that waterboarding is not torture. there are no surveys of other population groups to support a claim that everyone else agrees that its torture. ~0

15897~now youve done it hot button maxed notability makes my teeth hurt and blood boil. i argued vociferously against it at least in what they were looking at in literature and to also construe that a recent work has to have third party coverage like a published source isnt capable of being checked and quoted boggles my mind. so we have hoards of people making decisions about popular cultural articles... articles which attract readers to our pages my kids and their friends usually check things first or nearly so here when looking something up... we should celebrate that cultural link not kill it off when they dont have the first clue as to how hard it is to get published much less hit fiftyith on the nyt best sellers or some such list. and so forth. charmed articles are unnotable because they reached only million households the eight years the series ran... when a publisher is delighted selling copies oh my aching logic trees sigh.~0

15901~pov tag ive removed the pov tag since there is no feedback here as to how the article lacks pov.i wish people would stop bitching about the name. this is an encyclopedia a brief comment on how the name change caused some controversy in the media when it was first announced is about all the air play it deserves. has anyone seriously changed their mind about the merits of the console due to its name? personally i was a little taken aback by the name for about seconds and then i was intrigued about nintendos explanation of what the term represented and what that means for the intended audience for the console. / talk~0
15902~ jewish settlements map im removing the jewish settlements map because it is hardly npov the yellow area is unlabeled but when viewed together with the partition map one get the impression that the yellow area is all populated by arabs. in fact much of it including the entire southern negev was virtually unpopulated. overall the map creates the impression that palestine was an arab land with a tiny scattered jewish community. in fact as the text of the article states the population was approximately / jewish. it uses the term settlements thus ignoring jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like jerusalem safed and tiberias. also the term settlements has gained certain connotations in recent years since its applied to jewish population in the west bank and the gaza strip.~0
15903~haha. ctz i wrote something for you on my talk page.~0
15904~you guys just dont get it. your bad behavior drives other editors off the site who then become enemies. editors like brangifer and verbal are troublemakers who go around attacking articles and offending other editors who are trying to contribute their knowledge. neither of them has a collaborative attitude. they barrel into an article with guns blazing and wonder why people end up hating them and cant assume good faith. editors who spend all day every day on the site as if it were a fulltime job are just mucking things up for editors who are trying to be productive. once an editor has exhausted his knowledge any further contribution he makes is of little value. it is the brangifers and verbals on the site who are initiating the editwars.~0
15905~nothing personal radh i appreciate the input. my rant is directed at toa mostly. i realize tao you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. you like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty meaningless claims. how about this for a rule before you comment on other people read what they say before you comment on the page read the page. you seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. you have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page actually read the page and actually read others comments. while i believe radh is well intentioned he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page please see the writers section what used to be the lead section which doom who has been working ont his page for a very long time moved lower both doom and i have been working on this page a very long time both doom and i have actually read the page because both doom and i have actually written much of this page the comments doom and i make on the discussion page are well intentioned practical and based on knowledge of the page none of which applies to your comments tao. not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. i suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. radh suggests it and its an excellent and practical solution. it makes no sense to me. i cant help thinking you have tourettes or something finger tourettes that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.now a direct response to radh. what i am suggesting is an accurate middleoftheroad definition. they are not simply ideas. please read my comments above. according to sources i found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice beat generation means most commonly a subculture not a close circle. im not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. im suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. if someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral accurate way. so while i appreciate your good intentions radh this is not an excellent and practical solution because its not an actual change which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. here ill make it easy for you tao beat generation. its just right there. one click away. take ten minutes take an hour whatever. being an effective smartass means being a well informed smartass. ~0

15938~servo tracks are written on the back of tapes to keep the read/write heads on the correct data track. newer tape media have very thin dense data tracks. and data tracks on a half inch wide tape are now common. while moving from one reel to another when loaded in the tape drive there may be some lateral tape movement that could cause the drive to lose track of which data track it is reading. by putting servo tracks on the back side of the media where it will not affect the actual data being stored the servo system of a tape drive can tell precisely which track is being accessed and allows the tape drive to accurately position the tape media. tapelady~0

15942~something as necessary to a scientific theory as falsifiability i.e. it is not a theory unless it is falsifiable absolutely needs a peerreviewed journal article. there are articles that cite other methods of falsifiability these are not the methods those article cite so what am i missing? allow fair discussion and i wont vandalize. in fact as long as you stop deleting portions of our discussion i wont touch the article at all. if it is consensus that the article can be improved as suggested then someone else can fix the article but i wont touch it. this is a discussion page so allow fair discussion. if it is a consensus on wiki that my concerns are invalid then i will accept that consensus. in fact if there is a arbitrator for discussion employed by wiki i will accept their verdict but i will not accept arbitrary deletion based off of an invalid reading of the rules. that is not in keeping with the spirit of wiki.~0
15943~india has . bn people onesixth of all humanity. the penetration of the net is very large and it is rising vey steeply. if wikipedia goes on in this manner encouraging prochristian pov to the exclusion of all npov the encyclopaesias prestige and standing would suffer in india. the antichristian pov with sources and opinions from christian sites is okay if the above are the prospects that you want about wp. it is unfortunate that marketing of evangelist missions in india to collect more from abroad is being permitted in wp knowingly or otherwisei am not appealing against any block..~0
15944~ could the pimped out term used here be paraphrased? its crudely suggestive and may confuse the unhip because pimped out is not found in the average home dictionary. i didnt know what it meant until i asked my dad and then he was a bit redfaced trying to explain. anyway our job as editors is to clarify not confuse. ~0

15974~well it does have some issues so it seems. first i moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by newsmax as a gop figure. i placed that to the other section about criticism and praise. but now theres just these two other sentences. and theyre really just dealing with her public appearances which weve considered before in fact we eliminated them a while ago if you see prior notes. see this talk page where we mention that prior section once called through all this time fiorina has appeared remember that? we questioned the paragraphs and their citations and relevance. eventually it was eliminated. thats probably becasuse shes not unlike most public figures that make many many appearances through their lifetime. that section has been gone a while now seemingly without objection. im guessing thats because most of us have agreed that were not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made. if its significant or exceptional surely we can mention it. but now however im wondering about a very short section thats currently titled advocate at large. thats since its become whittled down to two sentences one of which is questionable. ive actually found she may have appeared at ripon several times. but to play devils advocate so what? republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups democrats before liberal groups greens before their own. and so on. therefore i question how exceptional this should be regarded. by the way second sentence mentions national press club as mentioned in the article. but this wikipedia article is attributing that to a press club although it reads as national press club. its not particular to national press club united states which im not quick to assume since the disambiguation the source named in the citation ambiguously calls it the national press club. again appearing before the national press club of the u.s. is not all that exceptional. they invite notable dignitaries all the time whoever whatever party etc. again so what? i wouldnt be surprised if the club has invited most of the presidential candidates if not had some of them speak in prior events before they became candidates. so im almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section. any comments? ~0

15978~. state where the sources use that exact wording.. i mentioned already that it may be disinformation and is not a majority opinion. links are for references so im not sure what youre talking about. besides that the link is for information which debunks the subject matter itself and is bias. ~0

15981~ march utci am not taking advice from either of you. this is a conversation between me and the administrator. the only problem i see is that obnoxious and confrontational editors like verbal are given free reign and in the process they drive other editors off the site. ive offered my advice stop valuing the input of wikiaddicts like verbal and start valuing the input of productive editors place a daily limit on the number of posts to discourage wikiaddiction and ask editors not to make extensive edits to subjects they know nothing about. until that is done the warring on wikipedia will continue and knowledgeable editors will continue to be driven off the site and the articles will suffer. ~0

15991~im pretty sure that its fine if the rates are understood to be per year or some other finite period as is usually the case in economics. after a year in the bank an amount of money m becomes m+i where i is the nominal interest rate. you can also write this as m+r+p where r is the real interest rate and p is the rate of inflation. then you get the first equality for r. it reduces to i p when p is small or if the rates are measured instantaneously something that probably only a mathematicians would do. ~0

15995~ symms civil rights im pinging you as i dont know whether this is on your watchlist on not original research is material for which no reliable published sources exist – are you suggesting that the new york times is not a reliable source? its the paper of record man. how is that not reliable. the associated press is a reliable source as well. also it isnt our opinion its the opinion of liberal opponents as i noted in my edit. ill remove the terrible part and just put criticized by liberal opponents for his civil rights record if you believe that will make it npov. also it isnt synthesis if im stating material not published by one of the sources. symms himself even gave a reason for voting against a civil rights bill because in his words its just another layer of the federal government that we dont need and that free market should determine how many housing units there are for disabled. i didnt state anything not explicitly stated by the source. i stated criticized by liberal opponents. indeed in one of his liberal opponents marilyn shuler of the idaho human rights commission stated that im saddened that once again sen. symms has chosen not to support civil rights legislation. i believe my edits were entirely sound. id like to hear an argument for why they werent but id need to hear it quickly. ~0
15996~ {{pingstaticvapor} thanks for all your help man he actually performed up here in vancouver last night and i got to kick it with him for a bit and talk about this ordeal. essentially if you ever come across a different free photo of him he would love you to use that instead. also sexsymbol was scrapped so in my opinion itd be best to just delete any references to that in the page. again thanks so much he really appreciates all of this if youre actually a fan let me know when he comes to your city and ill see what i can do to get you on the list s would be happy to return the favor. ~0
