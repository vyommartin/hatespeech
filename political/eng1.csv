5~ question sarah there is something that ive wondered about for a long time that is related to coi editing. one need look no further than my user page where i quote chris hedges they control our systems of information. and add surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporateapproved encyclopedia. at a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easilyled lamebrained losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy. what if anything is presently being done? im aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to prove that he had no coi related to the articles he edits and ive heard of this incident dozens of times since where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest. many times ive wondered how wikipedia went about finding this socalled proof. if i put myself in a position in which i was editing for pay but denied it how could it be proven that i was? i mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have wp give him/her the wp stamp of approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please. they can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check. ~0

11~ the size of wim crusios wiki page as of december nd the wim crusio wiki page constituted bytes of information where as the wiki page for ernest rutherford the father nuclear physics and winner of the nobel prize only has a wiki page of bytes as of december nd and maurice wilkins who won the nobel prize for his codiscovery of the structure of dna has a wiki page of only bytes while elizabeth blackburn who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in has only bytes on her wiki page. i could add many more names of nobel prize winners but if you wish to do so please feel free to compare the amount of information in wim crusios wki page to that of most nobel prize winners. i just thought i would point this fact out to the wiki community and ask for your comments on win crusios wiki page. please comment on weather you think it is too large and perhaps should be reviewed or if you think the wiki pages of ernest rutherford and many of his fellow nobel prize winners are simply too small. please feel free to leave your comments below this post.~0

13~rahul gandhi will be pm in ?~1
14~so you want me to lie and say le grand did nothing wrong? i think you should look through more of his afd comments. many times he lists the dont destroy essay with wikipedia policies. lumping those together with no clarification on what is what isnt the correct thing to do. im sure many people do click the essay and see its opinion but there is others that just assume its policy due to it being listed with a bunch of other policies. im not an expert on the unblock policy but i dont think this is part of it. i see this therefore if you want to dig yourself out of this hole your first step would be to understand and acknowledge that grc hasnt been doing anything wrong this last year as very disrespectful to my views in general an admin shouldnt be posting like that period.~0

28~i do not believe that i was edit warring given that i was reverting edits which appeared to be bad faith. the other editor has already left a personal attack on my talk page and is continuing to make claims which are contrary to the source and refuses to cite or explain. i would consider this either repeated insertion of unsourced material or deliberately introducing factual errors both considered vandalism or disruptive editing and are to be reverted on sight and constitute exceptions to rr when being reverted. i have stopped reverting given that the editor above has expressed concern and i had asked for reconsideration of the warning i was issued but i do not believe that the other editor is behaving appropriately and i had issued an aiv report. thank you. ...~0

39~alright thanks. i see it moved over to the labs now. thats cool. i used to do a bunch by hand and it was really tedious but this looks manageable.~0
40~ naji alali hi iani noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to . what is your source for that? im wondering because the arabic wikipedia article which this page started as a translation from cites his year of birth as while a book i have about him the one referenced in the article cites it as . what the book says in a footnote on the subject is sulaiman alshaikh the caricature artist naji alali in the kuwaiti magazine al`arabi no. august . naji al`ali saw this date and did not raise any objection. while the book is certainly not academic its also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is khalid al`ali the artists son.on the other hand on this page naji al`ali himself is quoted as saying i was born where christ was born between tiberias and nazareth in the village of alshahra in the northern galilee and i was expelled from there ten years later in to `ain alhilwe camp in lebanon.however the same site also bases its short biography of naji al`ali on the book i used and gives the year for his birth accordingly.unless you have a solid source i think we may have to leave it as unknown.by the way that site also shows a pretty cool pflp poster about his assassination i wonder could we get permission to use it... all the best talk ~0

47~actually undue weight can also results in zero weight. as it is the whole issue is insinuation and extrapolation of given events. just because the article doesnt outright say that edwards is the father because there was no father listed it is quite clear that this is the intent. now editors familiar with me consider me to be a fnc fanboy and appolgist regarding conservatives and republicans so my objection to this is clearly not a partisan point of view. that said this is in violation of several wp policies.~0
48~a sample video as mentioned on the village pump and on my talk page ive created a small sample video of an echocardiogram describing one of the features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.while the original avi was kb and encoded in the msmpeg v codec the edited version just a black overlay of all identifying patient and hospital information is . mb and compressed in the cinepak codec.would you like me to email a copy to you to see about converting to theora format? nov utc~0
49~actually the format of titling appears to be dl on the cover in the orange bar at the top only. on both the cover and the title page advanced dungeons dragons dragonlance official game adventure dragons of ice douglas nilesthey are not called modules anywhere in the official titling though this term is still used to refere to them in dragon mag and in each other for example dragons of mystery page . i have no problem with aerie of the slave lords as this is a clear title for this series that does not need to be distinguished from anything else. clearly dragonlance is not available though if the modules had not spawned numerous other products it may be the title that would have been used. dragonlance modules is not specific enough.i am still inclined towards dl dragonlance modules. my second choice at this time is not on your list but very similar to some there dragonlance modules dl series. ~0
50~one other policy i neglected to mention is the one on copyright violation. material from other websites like the institutes website is generally copyrighted and cannot be cut and pasted into our articles. facts and ideas can be extracted but they must be totally rewitten in order to be acceptable for our use. even if you have a connection with the institute we would need them to explicitly release the material under a license compatible with our own licenses and this would have to be done through official channels not via casual discussion. in the meantime please do not add any copyrighted text to any wikipedia article. thanks~0

59~so what if konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers? thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category. dualpane behaviour is part of konquerors functionality not its whole functionality. you can play textmode tetris from within emacs. would you categorize emacs as a tetris clone?as for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management à la classic macintosh finder. they certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches. so it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there. besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software. but again youre missing the point as ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is usage of the term in qualified circles. ~0

65~globalised a bit ive added some european perspective as the article seemed to be written from a purely theoretical/usha perspective. ive tried not to make it a sales catalogue but the road authorities here often develop their own approaches which they build into software packages via commercial contracts and them mandate the use of their sw packages on the schemes that they fund.~0
66~thats not an explanation thats you saying i think everythings fine now when the guy broke a rr and showed no sign of changing his behaviour so he got blocked for it. apparently that now means he will no longer be disruptive. the fact that someone of your obvious intelligence considers that this editor has changed his behaviour is astonishing. ~0

78~well if you are going to threaten me for my good faith edits of a wikipedia article i can guess where you stand on domestic violence.ive readded straight facts from well documented sources. it will be curious if you or any other editor gives a reason for reverting this as it conforms to criticism ive received. there is nothing that can be construed as or or editorialization.anyone can choose to take it to the talk page. i see this is not the first time that editors have made efforts toward a balanced article.~0
79~ as you have repeatedly proven that you are inherently incapable of editing according to the policies and practices of this project and are only here to push your own pov agenda that of turning this article not a blp into some kind of tribute puff piece to your long dead hero your disruptive actions are to be expected and will be dealt with in the appropriate manner. bdefdcada ~0
80~youre kidding right? you think every reference in wikipedia needs to be a web based source so you can check it? from wpcite the citation should state as clearly fully and precisely as possible how a reader can find the source material such as by external link to the source website. if the material is not findable online it should be findable in reputable libraries archives or collections. if a citation without an external link is challenged as unfindable any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably findable though not necessarily reliable providing an isbn or oclc number linking to an established wikipedia article about the source the work its author or its publisher or directly quoting the material on the talk page briefly and in context. ~0
81~ january utcthats not the reason why im being blocked. you said before that im being blocked for personal attacks. so why is it that this person called ukexpat can vandalizes my article and i get in trouble for calling him one? youre not making sense. again i didnt attack anyone personally. what are you talking about?? anyway i do believe that im being blocked for racist/discriminatory reasons. i noticed that american wiki editors or admins block those of italian descent from posting about their italian/latin culture. this is very racist and is not tolerable. im going to ask you just things why cant i post my original content and is there a special appeals board that hears cases dealing with racist editors who discriminate against authors of articles who come from different cultures? thats all i want to know. ~0

126~excellent. and please dont damage your book on our account for sure. it is an interesting question where was the camera? thats a fair question. to jump to the conclusion that it was impossible is ludicrous. but thats typical for the moonbats. the picture is useful for another reason as it shows a similar relative position of the lem and the antenna for this apollo flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in apollo . in both cases the antenna is at a degree angle away from the lem and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other despite the websites claims to the contrary. the moonbats isolate on specific items as their evidence but the more one sees the broader picture the more their phony arguments get shown up. ~0

161~== attributing and classifying of personalities == invitation. your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed. some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here. i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word. necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania. we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat. renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us. cultural aspirations of the later nat. ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of lithuania. but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically lithuanian. i mean that such authors in as čiurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of lithuanian culture when in european or worldwide context. a parallel example may be taken from literature of india. poet tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india. making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture. but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones. this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n. ren. could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in lithuanian context. they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture. čiurlionis is the best example here. in other way the later lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life see the table below. we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramūnas bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism. period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period the younger generation approx – painter and composer čiurlionis painter kazys šimonis poet and philosopher vilius storastas vydūnas dramatist sofija kymantaitė čiurlionienė poets adomas jakštas motiejus gustaitis liudas gira composer stasys šimkus philosopher ramūnas bytautas. reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and postwar years. poets v mykolaitis putinas kazys binkis writer ignas šeinius – jurkūnas artists all ars group philosopher juozas girnius modernists introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life central european modernism. note lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence. jul utc~0

164~i was just released from prison on december . during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike. actually and / days started pounds ended up an estimated pounds. generally i drank two cups of milk in the morning and drank water as needed. i was never forcefed. nor oddly enough was i ever hungry or in appreciable discomfort. i was examined almost daily by prison medical staff. probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the bodys electrolytes calcium potassium sodium magnesium phosphate and to consume just enough aminoacids to supply neurotransmitters. if you merely drink water after a couple weeks youll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance and youll feel terrible. most people attribute this to not eating but i learned that its actually due to the electrolyte imbalance not the lack of calories. at the time the longest hunger strike id ever heard of was referred to in the capote book in cold blood by perry smith in the early s days. i could probably have gone two more months. ~0

213~the liber pontificalis is not sacred scripture and not i but the source quoted said that the decree attributed to saint peters first successor is probably apocryphal. is anything else attributed to pope linus? or was this the most important thing he did as pope? by all means mention that the liber pontificalis is said to contain that information. it was by oversight that i omitted the mention of the liber pontificalis though the fact that i have no way of checking that the liber pontificalis contains that statement probably hd some subconscious part in my forgetfulness.the question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to pope linus is aprocryphal. the letter of pope nicholas i is certainly genuine. i should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are i think less likely to go to mass wearing pants than without a veil and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil. if the pants question disappears from the footnote i will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article. by all means add the point that i regrettably forgot to mention that traditionalists do not like women in pants at mass.~0

273~welcomewelcome to wikipedia my name is ryan aka . i noticed that you were new and havent received any messages yet. i just wanted to see how you were doing. wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first since it uses different formatting than other sites that use html and css. in the long run though youll find that the wikisyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. here are a few links to get you startedhow to edit a pageediting policy conduct and structure tutorialpicture tutorialhow to write a great articlethere are a lot of policies and guides to read but i highly recommend reading over those first. if you have any questions feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. please be sure to sign your name on talk using four tildes to produce your name and the current date along with a link to your user page. this way others know when you left a message and how to find you. its easier than having to type out your name right? i hope you enjoy contributing to wikipedia. we can use all the help we can get have a nice day.sincerely . august utc~0

305~ and use the confusing redundent yet common phrase north america... not refering to the continent. either of two reasonsa desire to place the united states last on the list by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find.simply an oversight. well nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u.n. subregions. its amazing that this list puts the united states last even though it has most of the people and / of the area. is someone trying to deemphasize americas importance? no its just in alphabetical order. talk about... any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states?? yes in the human geography section namely the rd paragraph. other related terms are also treated in that sxn. talk central americans are not north americans we are own people and we are not northerners. we are seperate from them and are nothing like them you can try to correct me but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down and sometimes other ignorant groups of people. i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this. i dont care what the white man tells us. theyre not us. we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be. this is just another way of bringing us down. i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us. if we have been living here for the longest time should it not be us who decides who we want to be? tito a. martĩnezthis is a lovely essay but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling. central america happens to be located in north america so central americans are north americans its a geographical thing not a cultural thing. perhaps youre thinking of latin america and anglo america? actually tito can undeclare himself. if youll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america you will see that spanish language defines north americas southernmost country as mexico. esnorteamérica redirects to esamérica del norte which lists the lists the following political units in north to south ordergreenlandcanadaunited statesmexiconote that central america is not on this listwilyd is also right as far as english language goes. north america includes mexico and central america. i think america terminology should provide a better explanation than it currently does. a section on english vs. spanish terminology would help. i dont speak spanish but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. maybe ill recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this. okay but ill claim the fatal flaw here is this américa del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america. tito may not be a norteamericano although i dont think he declares himself here either doesnt spanish have an equivilent to lacademie? but hes still north american. actually i dont think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans. his country if its in central america is a part of the north american continent but the cultural division is what hes concerned about. want to help me update america terminology? i think america terminology reflects correct english usage. maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints although im actively involved in that article and know itll get shot down as original research. roughly speaking there arent political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america not that im convinced the term exists in contrast~0

334~unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once. frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page. rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions. ~0

343~first off you should not edit the list templates directly as the bot will ignore any changes. also you cannot use vertical pipes anywhere in the syntax other than in separating the template name the section name and the reason otherwise everything messes up. in place use . from the yellow box at the top of my talk page if ive left you a message on your talk page i will watch it for your response so please reply there.i am aware that the bot usually overwrites manual edits as i said i spent hours trying to figure out why following the instructions listed on the rfc page werent producing the results they should have. but when i saw that you had manually edited the list templates i thought perhaps you had disabled the bot until it was working properly.basically youre telling me the syntax that is commonly used throughout wikipedia vertical piping is not valid within the rfc templates? thats messed up. whats even more messed up is the total lack of user instructions that mention that restriction. this has become a nightmare of a process. ~0

404~no apologies i make no apologies for what i said on the humanities reference desk. at times i may have gone too far elsewhere in wikipedia but not in this instance. when people say stupid things on the reference desk i have no qualms about pointing this out and am not likely to change any time in the future especially when it is unlikely the person who asked the question is being sincere. note that assume good faith doesnt really apply in the reference desk else we wouldnt be able to suggest that users are asking homework questions which we do all the time or otherwise just wasting our time which we do as well. i rarely frequent the humanities reference desk mostly science only so perhaps you dont get as many cranks at humanities but really i dont care. stupid questions deserve pointed replies. anyway ive said my piece and dont want to debate this anymore. as such im likely to ignore any further follow ups by you. if you feel my comments so bad that you wish to seek outside assitance thats up to you.~0

407~ this article is a perfect example of doublethink. the leftists are making george orwells come true and turning our society into a bizarre illogical politicallycorrect nightmare where male and female are the same thing and interchangeable. this is postmodernist nonsense run amok and delusions by lunatics become accepted as fact by the leftist media. xy is a man. xy is a woman. xy has always been a woman. he is a woman trapped in a mans body. he does not have a mental disorder despite the fact that it is proven to be a disorder by psychologists. why are you calling xy a man? thats transphobia its racist and sexist and misogynistic and transphobic xy does not does exist he has never existed she is xx she merely looked like a man but has magically become a woman by her thoughts mental thought determines biology she is a transwoman not a man soft science psychology trumps hard science biology there is no such thing as biology whats a biology? thats transphobic you are a transphobe stop harassing this poor woman and respect her magical mental thoughts~0

411~first off i am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. i dont know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. as a life long resident of miller having both parents from miller i am well aware of the boundaries of miller. and your account is false...also i am not talking of this original town of miller or is supposed boundaries but the miller beach area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call miller beach a neighborhood of gary makes the very notion of miller smaller than it really is... i dont have agenda here. i just dont want my home town slighted by misinformation. it is the word neighborhood that is of issue. miller beach has several neighborhoods... it was settled almost years before gary was established. it is town that has been annexed. it is not a neighborhood of gary. it existed before gary. these are historical facts. is miller under the municipal control of the city of gary? yes...is it an area within the political boundaries of gary yes... is it part of gary? no~0

439~great but what i meant about weakest link is that i dont see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources ive seen have you got a source that places something called postindustrial in the context of the history of noise music? im presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag.unless the sources are good on this its too divergent in my opinion to include right now. some of what might be called postindustrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesnt warrant inclusion. you might as well do a section on deathmetal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music.personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composer/artist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i dont think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and thats why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. we now see a number of artists for example jeff mills being redefined as a postindustrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now. i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic. ~0

502~ i understand quite well the situation in albanian because it occurs also in my native romanian and other balkan languages e.g. in romanian great man is usually omul mare or un om mare but it also can be marele om. it is related to compound names and nouns and actually you brought it up when you started lecturing on albanian structures in a postscriptum. all your examples come from modern albanian not from protoalbanian whatever language it was. i can add some etymologies such as the one orel provided for thënukël = dogberry from earlier thënubël < palb. tsunuabōla cf. lith. šúnobuolas dacian kinouboila = dogs apple. in what you quoted so far hamp did not claim anything about protoalbanian compound nouns or syntax. please provide relevant bibliography otherwise i dont see why should we be dismissive of other scholars theories. orel georgiev and many others are also linguists. ~0
503~i think the entire article should be tagged as politicized and the part about future trends as speculative. my point was that scientists are learners and we are increasingly using them as know it all teachers. yes they probably can make educated guesses better than anyone else but its still an educated guess. also if you didnt notice i am totally against spewing unnecessary carbon as this statement i think this article superbly misses the point that pollution and waste of all types are stupid ways to go about doing things where better ways are known and we are making guinea pigs of all our planets species points out. ~0

527~legally there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the schengen area there are such criteria for joining the eu but this is a different matter. the only possibility to join the schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu which includes a clause that schengenrelated eu law would be applicable in the associated noneu state. the associated state would only have the right to be consulted. thus the u.s. would have to accept each and every majority decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. and the u.s. would have to accept that every thirdcountry national holding a residence title of a schengen state could enter the u.s. without even being checked. to bil guadeloupe and french guiana are not inside the schengen area because this would e.g. require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french guiana and suriname brasil etc. with hightech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe. i can understand why they do not invest any money into this.~0

551~the multitude of sources simply cannot be ignored. there are several articles stating the environmental impact. i will actually expand the section in the article because the monument is so big people should know as a part of an encyclopedia the river bed violations. i would disagree with the arguments given above and that the edit should have more expansion within the article as a half dozen citations stating there are environmental issues. also there is a persistent conflict of interest from the users above but from their followups there intentions will be clear.~0
552~ do you follow the current scientific literature? please try not to sound so ridiculous when you are accusing others. it has a bad reflection on your own comments nevertheless recent research indicates that selfdescribed race is a nearperfect indicator of an individuals genetic profile at least in the united states. using genetic markers tang et al. identified genetic clusters among individuals sampled from locations in the united states and were able to correctly assign individuals to groups that correspond with their selfdescribed race white african american east asian or hispanic for all but individuals an error rate of .%. they conclude that ancient ancestry which correlates tightly with selfdescribed race and not current residence is the major determinant of genetic structure in the u.s. population.~0

563~request for help = request for help hi again cat as perviously i have noticed a strong antigreek bias on several articles related to macedonia. ive had issues with both furper and beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour fyrom. ive officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious fyrom pov members of wikipedia. specifically balkanfever as i said verbatim on politis talkpage...this is a difficult battle because so far i am alone at the moment i am a newbie and as i said to one of the admins on notice board... i feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policemans ball. however i still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what i perceive as nonnpov behavior by these admins. i noticed while researching this issue youve also have problems with them. would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so i can add them to my report to show i am not alone? furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more greeks than me around here. would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if theyve also had problems with those two... and if so add those incidents to your list? and perhaps get them to contact others? where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. i will check back here in a couple of days. have courage. regards ...~0

589~replied talk please note that i did restore the revisions to talk rockerhi i couldnt help but notice that you have deleted several of my contributions that i worked very hard to create including several brand new pages that i had just made. yes i know these pages were short and lacked content but you must know it takes time to write a long and informative page on wikipedia. im just trying to contribute and i dont know why im having such a hard time doing it. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs im not sure that edits such as this back up your claim of just trying to contribute and neither do the three articles which you created this afternoon which were as you know were just made up nonsense example if plato was a christian this is what his philosophy would be called. qed. talk 飞天号航天服 飞天 deletion hi you deleted 飞天号航天服 飞天i think these qualify under since they are the original language names for the article in question feitian space suit so are indeed likely search terms. if someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name shouldnt they be able to reach the correct article? ... you used csd reason r recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers. however redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful as are redirects in other languages.this says redirects in other languages are generally useful ... hi there this is a difficult one i can see both sides of the coin. ive tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through categoryredirects from alternative languages but im still not sure. i have always read the redirect from another language as being more related to things such as kyiv topical one that one read the talk page but i digress or das wohltemperirte clavier rather than a literal transalation of every articles name in to other languages particulary those with nonlatin character sets. this is why i feel that the two mandarin? words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the english language wikipedia. but the bottom line is that i am one admin one opinion which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable. the redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. if they are renominated for deletion i will recuse myself from the process and well see what others think. sound ok to you? kind regards talk well theres the essay wikipediaredirects for discussion/redirects from foreign languages . the articles name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. ie. its a chinese spacesuit the actual name is in chinese not english. from the bit about nonlatin characters doesnt that indicate bias since english is used in hong kong as an official language where chinese characters are prevalent or india where nonlatin script is common and english is widely used. but we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type~0

593~thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously. to reiterate my original explanatoin to james im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about. for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article. see for example something like roe v. wade theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case. even if you really consider moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of godwins law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be. similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there? jul utc~0

595~ in response to your threat on my user page what is a green thumb for getting pages deleted? im sorry you are taking this personally but your page was nowhere near appropriate for wikipedia and as you saw from the afd page there was strong consensus on that from other editors. in addition i did not delete your page an administrator did. as for the sockpuppets i did not make the initial report but i definitely added to it. once again it was a wikipedia administrator that blocked the accounts after their investigation not me. i am not an administrator and do not have the ability to delete pages block users etc. you need to take your case to the admins involved instead of making silly threats against me. ~0

683~i looked at the vandalism page and i have not vandalized the big o and dukes page.vandalism is any addition removal or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of wikipedia. the most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor page blanking or the insertion of nonsense into articles.any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism. even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. for example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — its just not helpful and should be removed or restated. not all vandalism is obvious nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial detrimental but well intended or outright vandalism.committing blatant vandalism violates wikipedia policy. if you find that another user has vandalized wikipedia you should revert the changes and warn the user see below for specific instructions. users who vandalize wikipedia repeatedly despite warnings to stop should be reported to wikipediaadministrator intervention against vandalism and administrators may block them.~0

719~i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteattempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape. if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader.i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do. to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal. and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway.further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists? paperclips? light bulbs?some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out.am i missing something? p.s. what do you mean about wpciv?~0

723~ obviously there is some antiamericanism in canada. this means nothing necessarily with regards to the structure of this article. i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans. and i asked for another side of the story and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. your response here is confusing. as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article not making additions to the article. several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim antiamericanism on the basis of involvement in the middleeast... that doesnt mean its a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries. as far as your sources go you did not comment on the obscurity of them. you have still not properly defended james tagg yes that was me who removed that a year ago. i dont see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or rather inappropriate to add. i read that source left you detailed comments and you said something like dont pov push and reverted my edits. you are not making an argument here. re culture clash in archive again there are two sides to every story. please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed and why do students opinions have so much weight by the way?. but there likely wont be many sources to support this because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldnt exist for a counter argument. nevertheless ill take a look...one last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality and onesideness breaching neutrality. i am not trying to say that what youre saying is not true at all. im sure it is true the the extent that it is. but how much is that? the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article that they should be immediately moved.~0

727~deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists. so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert/yorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environmentfrom a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two. if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy ? this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.this scenario is dennetts and to some extent everetts. since the question doesnt even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. you might conclude that this question doesnt make any sense. but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not. in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy .to give an example of actual or and synth ill go beyond dennetts example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective. for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later. what is the subjective experience? from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? boltzmanns brain is a similar idea. ~0

771~there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white. users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view cited sources or not its obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong. i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what .% of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this .% obviously not including alun slrubenstein. when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another. all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke. you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist. so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a white person is just do us all a favor and either delete this article since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you get over it and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesnt scientifically exist. /end commafest ~0

804~as for your claims of stalking that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation. i have assumed good faith and good intentions on your part and have never suggested or seen reason to suggest that you might have some ulterior motive in massadding links to one specific companys web page. nor for that matter have i ever made any suggestion that this is an administrative matter or even mentioned such a role. clearly as a party to this disagreement i would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest. i would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. chatspy ~0

841~ request regarding current rfar/clarification there is an open request for clarification regarding a sanction decided at wikipediaarbitration/requests/case/abdwilliam m. connolley see live link or permanent link. is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. i agree with him and unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised i support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. my reason for this it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at rfar/clarification and that i was blocked while this request was pending for comments made in the request itself is an additional impediment.there is no need for extra debate or argument. i have stated that i am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which i interpreted the sanction pending clarification by arbcomm. so the status quo is that the restriction is tight though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. i do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits and id argue that he did so consider. i accepted sandsteins decision clarification as a neutral administrator pending arbcomm review not future perfects who was already involved and i had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.i will continue to respect sandsteins tightening as standing and binding on me and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated and it did permit legitimate comment before arbcomm when i am an originating party as is normal. normally i can having filed respond there to comments from other editors also made there which is what i did. arbcomm specifically allowed me to originate a case and if im clearly involved as well i see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.i will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors and i will avoid in such a filing if it happens unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. obviously if i file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin i will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required which would only mention other disputes peripherally and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.i hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual rfar than there has been to the existing rfar/clarification which as it stands includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material i filed. its been pointed out by with clerk attention requested and nothing was done. nevertheless if the request is closed without action its moot. the real point here is that if clerks were following filings before arbcomm surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved and possibly the editor warned. ~0

859~ response to third opinion requesthi im here to give your third opinion. i think its important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions. its not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards. it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused. theres no dash key on my keyboard. i know how to make a dash however —. but i do web dev and work for a printing company. and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and. i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and im writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page. so in my mind the question is whether this is a misconception or just ignorance. i believe that to properly call something a misconception it must be believed to be a rule when in fact such a rule is not correct. ive never heard anyone say just use hyphens for everything. it has only become the default because we have no dash keys. so i would lean toward excluding this entry unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes not just misconceptions. hope this helps. ~0

994~ive been working for some time on categoryroman bridges but you certainly provide new infos here. this is what a webpage says about the alconetar bridge destroyed in the th century arches left moved in i hope they did not change the arch structure then. here the most authoritative photo el puente de alconétar sobre el tajo en garrovillas cáceres cerca de alcántara estaba en la vía de la plata. debió de ser también monumental. fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo xiii y nunca después reconstruido. hoy día es un puente sin río. al construir el pantano de alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. en el año se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. apenas quedan tres arcos de los que tuvo. se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones. as for the pons fabricius there are some roman bridges and even more medieval ones whose arches are designed somewhere between semicircular and segmental. this is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. this means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semicircle character.~0

996~thanks moonriddengirl. wikidea im sure youre an excellent lawyer and i admire your goal to turn wikipedia into a superior reference work for law students its one i share with one amendment. wikipedia is not a legal resource for lawyers and law students. it is not a casebook. it is not a practitioners text. it is a work for the laypeople to explain as simply as possible in this case how the law works. thats what you should aspire to with your articles and its what i aspire to with mine. the layperson is more helped by thirdparty references and summaries than to them unintelligible case citations and full body quotations from judgments. while such quotations and citations have their place this i feel uses such case citations well but i might be a teensy bit biased they are the obiter not the ratio.~0

1000~have you looked at the ribbon international page? ~0
1001~{{unblock i am appealing a hour block that was placed on me before i could post my response via the administrators message board. i apologize in advance for the length of this but i believe that its necessary to include all of these details. i wrote a summary at the end so that administrators could get an overview if they dont have time to read the whole statement.i will be addressing the claim that i violated the rr rule in the second paragraph of this article according to wpblp biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subjects privacy... in a book written in a foreign language with a lot of jargon there are often competing translations/interpretations. and a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes misquotes dubious translation and outofcontext statements. as per wpblp i think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used and for the same reason the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.with than in mind on the th of february i improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with wpblp based on this source.userzero responded to one of my edits by stating that i cant read. and in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a wikipedia administrator told me in as many words to get off wikipedia.take a break i didnt take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which i was told by said individual that i had behavioral problems.said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics i started to write a complaint against you why do i need to know that? he can let me know when he posts it and then later responding to another edit he didnt like by saying that it was on my charge sheet.now the reason i am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the rr issueafter posting my version of the paragraph userzero subsequently changed it to this.i will post only the first few words of his statement and the sourcesource there is a reason to kill babies on the enemy sideuserzero babies on the enemy side may be killed .after those first few words userzero continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. now at best this is a serious distortion. and when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing sometimes contradictory sources rationales theories proposals and ideas many of which are subsequently discounted limited in scope or just tossed by the wayside the disparity the statement may be done and there is a reason is even greater.aside from the distortion mentioned above in contradiction to wpblp userzero also opted for a particularly liberal outofcontext translation.why did userzero replace my edit with his own. his statementprefer source with an actual quotationas i showed above he didnt use an actual quotation.furthermore after seeing his comment i searched but wasnt able to find any wikipedia reference to a such a preference leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own wpjustdontlikeit on me without explanation. his actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multipronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in i.e. encouraging me take a break.newlin~0
1002~this is untrue. i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true. it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me. usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing. the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false. i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently. having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulent..ism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me etc. is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate. in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so. although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc. that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system.there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this.you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc. so that is also impossible.                       ~0

1018~janettedoe i appreciate your finding and uploading the rao articles. however this can easily become an endless discussion. for some other yadavapologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than rao and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the yadav apologists are not and have no intention aware or unaware of being—will go scurrying again for the article. after that we all will try to interpret it weighing the pros and cons again to a degree the apologists will not for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path. i think we cant make the determination of whether rao applies here or not at least not yet. let the secondary sources do that. we need to rely on recent scholarship especially that in textbooks published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds. two such books by susan bayly and christophe jaffrelot both widely used in universities around the world both reviewed extensively in the literature are being used in the article. let the article writing or rewriting proceed based on these or similar books. once the article has been fleshed out we can come back to the issue of rao. otherwise nothing will get done and those of us whove taken time out from our other wikipedia not to speak rl pursuits to attend to the article will slowly walk away out of touch and out of sympathy. «talk» ~0

1027~i dont at all propose that it should be transcribed as meːn in this or any other article. if anything at all just a brief mention of the raising of trap and mouth in a prenasal environment would suffice. i just thought it was an american thing to raise before nasals i do it myself but i often hear aussies do it quite a bit as well and i dont hear english people do it at all. the only difference is that americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it. im not really surprised you dont have a broad accent being a wikipedian. im not saying its not possible.youre right i was just kind of thinking aloud.~0

1029~yes you got it the govt lied. see the talk page for cselr ok im lazy and not typing current page name. they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from. i have provided the link to the index of papers produced mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw so you can confirm that the business case was never provided. there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary. some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and posttfnsw publications such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are % lower.. i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about. that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language. the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions. the terms of reference open to the public to see for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this. i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past selfproclaimed senior executive of tfnsw. so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group. = link to index of docs produced for st call that is why there was the nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at. by making the nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the st call they made it public. the outcome they expected was what ended up happening.~0

1032~this article is being rewritten at jack abramoff/abramoffrefactor. please take note of the existing notes and outline and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. comments welcome. thanks archives archive friday th august talkjack abramoff/archive i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. copyviothis article and its sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia. theyre essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal. both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia. they need to be deleted immediately. alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio. tyco as below was edited the text was accurate but half the news story was pasted in here. you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story attribute a link and it not be a copywrite violation. its called plagerism. tyco almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article. ive removed part of it as it needs to be rewritten. i think ive cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up hopefully. there is alot of nonessential stuff in this article about peripheral people and not about abramoff however. it needs to be cleaned up more as the article meanders alot here and there. i reverted some things you took out outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about delay. that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted. it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it. just providing a link is not attribution and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism not fair use unless you are quoting. also if you are going to say the los angeles times reports you need to source the times not a secondary source i.e. democracy now.i modified the quote and attributed properly. the speech from tom delay is a direct quote its in quotations so of course it is taken wordforword from the source. ill tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. heres the primary source for the other thing. no problem. if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first and then rework it i dont usually just leave it out if the quote is accurate. btw have you found a link for the franken quote i cant find anything other than on blogs. honestly im not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is really anyway. the forced abortions part was originally reported by brian ross at abc news for / on march . it also appears in al frankens book the truth with jokes in the tom delay saipan sex tour and jack abramoff casino getaway chapter. since weve agreed that primary sources are key ive change the attribution in the article. the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed norquist etc pages to it.basically we need fewer facts and more context. at the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. i moved the whole scandal to its own page. this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players in particular ralph reed. i am not doing this to hide the scandal i think that people looking for info on i~0

1049~ january you currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a hour period. additionally users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule. if you continue you may be blocked from editing. please do not repeatedly revert edits but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. if necessary pursue dispute resolution. do not continue removing reliable sourced information from the article purely because you disagree with its validity. the only proof of it being false is the personal belief of a handful of editors which does not invalidate the information.  talk · contribs ~0
1050~a totallydisputed notice would probably be appropriate given the depth of disagreement that exists here but i cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article. slimvirgin has also used that wording recently but i rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice.to answer your second question my side has brought forward a proposal and the other side has not yet responded. this is sadly consistent with recent patterns of delay. ill make no comment on whether or not this is a deliberate strategy. ~0

1066~i can help you create an rfc but you need to propose a neutrallyworded sentence saying what change you want to make. do you want to add yemen was home of the sabaeans biblical sheba a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years. you can propose this in the rfc but people who have commented so far are unlikely to support that. you would be hoping that the listing of the rfc would bring in more contributors who might agree with you. it sounds like the current contributors want everything to be extremely wellsourced to respected scholarship and they dont want anything said beyond what is known for sure. e.g. they doubt that we know the exact location of the sabaeans. you have been writing at excessive length and this discourages dialog. ~0

1072~hi fracophoniethanks for taking the time to write such a long message i appreciate this.in terms of what i said about the age i didnt mean to cause offense. i thought i read somewhere that you had to be over to make these decisions but i think i was getting confused with the check user privileges. i have already read some of those policies but will read the rest later today. i am not a troll i just need time to get used to all these acronyms policies etc.from what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what i was expecting.i really dont have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what i have said. for example one user just wrote there is another site called this is this is precisely why i had to keep responding on the afc delete page. in terms of the rest i agree to do them of course i can only apologise once i am unblocked can you apologise for me?on a side note i am actually french and jewish shame about the gay part though~0

1084~speedy deletion of mass masud a tag has been placed on mass masud requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate such as at articles for deletion. under the specified criteria where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted it may be deleted at any time. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. talk ♦ contribs ~0

1094~this article is extremly bias. how can you guys put more bias torwards one person than you do the holocaust? so he has been sued. many people have been sued but its not the focal point of their article. isnt the point of wikipedia to be unbias? you can at least add a nuetrality dispute to the top of the page. there are many people against the fda and what not so not saying there is any evidence is stupid. and to say his book is taking other peoples works and putting them into one book is also stuid. a lot of books are other peoples works its called citations. wikipedia is other peoples works. wikipedia has tons of backlash against it and thats not the focal point of wikipedias wikipedia article. so why is this one article so bias when i havent seen any others that are this blatent?~0

1098~just to make the point that im not making this problem up heres the abstract of who are the canadians? changing census responses canadian ethnic studies journal spring by monica boyd doug norris at the close of the twentieth century canadian has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group up from . percent in to nearly percent in and to percent in the census of canada. from what groups did this indigenous label draw in the five years between the and the censuses? using unpublished tabulations from the and canadian censuses this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the canadianborn age in and age by . we find that most of the increases between and in canadian ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in british origin responses. between and increasing canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the british and french ethnic origin counts. in some provinces notably the prairie provinces of alberta manitoba and saskatchewan shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups. ~0

1111~ singer list? hi. i have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for scott weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the split from weiland section... how about someone ends the split... section with a closing paragraph about scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like rumored replacement singers or something like that. and that section can have an opening statement saying numerous individuals have been considered for scott weilands replacement they include and then below write a list of every person who has been rumored.it is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that vr is looking for a new singer...anyways please let me know what you think on this idea... i am open to criticism and it doesnt bother me if you disagree with this idea just let me know thanks.zach~0

1127~ i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world. you still prefer previous title i.e. united nations statistical divisions to the current one i.e. united nations geoscheme?if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones. google this statistical divisions site the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments. google this statistical divisions sitetherefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m. . un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical. i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping. natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country. i use it quiet often. it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as un geoscheme. try google book search and you will find at least the followingthe best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia. as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories....the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region ....country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification....were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme /unsd/methods/m/... that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme. in fact ...i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc. have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research. this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better. although it is not official term or a technical term un m. i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m. . moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm. of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidence/citations here before i bring it to rm. comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ~0

1153~addition of history as can be seen i have added a new history section for the bank of liverpool previously there were just a few lines of intro. i have taken it up to when the bank acquired martins bank and became the bank of liverpool and martins. there already is separate article on martins which makes reference to the bank of liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.i propose continuing the bank of liverpool history to when the name was shortened to martins and possibly beyond.how should the overlap with the martins bank article be treated? the name change to martins is really a red herring it is the liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by barclays and therefore i suggest should be the main article. one solution would be to have martins pre history as a selfcontained article with the bank of liverpool article continuing up to .~0

1174~ organisations also count as things. the section you quote from wpname is in the section titled use english words which goes on to say sometimes the usual english version will differ somewhat from the local form as in franz josef strauss and rarely as with mount everest it will be completely different. this is clearly a case where the usual english version differs somewhat. wikipedianaming conventions political parties carries several exceptions the third exception is parties whose name is more commonly known by acronyms than their full name in international newsmedia. since gpv is more commonly known by its acronym this naming convention does not apply. there is no problem with ambiguity since there are no other topics in wikipedia that carry the name gpv. even if there were this article would then be named gpv political party to disambiguate them.in conclusion please read naming conventions in full before quoting them to me. also please demonstrate that gpv is not the most commonly used name in english for this party which you have not yet done. thank you. ~0
1175~ ambiguous ? so mabuska irish can mean more than one thing ? i will qoute you on that .thanks . — preceding unsigned comment added by ... of course it can. the word irish wasnt invented on the establishment of the irish free state. talk quote me all you want it depends on the context of the term when its being used as to whether its applicable or not. note how i said citizenship and ethnicity i never mentioned nationality which is the real key meaning. the nationality meaning of the term is the predominantly used form on wikipedia. in nationality terms it refers to the republic of ireland. but you already know that im sure. talk in nationality terms it refers to the republic of ireland no such country . so nationality terms it refers to ireland . — preceding unsigned comment added by ... oh wow ireland as in ireland the state whose official description is the republic of ireland. whats the point in this inane conversation. talk ireland whose official name is ireland . — preceding unsigned comment added by ... reading for you . also i see as you speak both . — preceding unsigned comment added by ... ~0

1195~i dont understand how you can claim that other uses or otherwise has any kind of meaning to anyone other than the one that wrote it and possibly you it seems. if the templates are changed then that either means that the display should also be changed or that it is the reason they are changing the template. either way the change itself would likely nullify this argument. i agree with magio above this seems to be nothing more than a subtle way at irritating other editors by somehow logically trying to argue nonsense. ~0

1221~ april utcyou are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. in your last revision of the article you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. once again the statement about public schools and id materials was unsourced when you first added it which is why i removed it. upon further examination i removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the centre for intelligent design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. it is actually very unlikely that this centre for intelligent design did so in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in and this organization arose in . finally believing in the historicity of adam and eve does not make one a fundamentalist. many christians reconcile the genesis creation narrative with science see the biologos foundation for example which advocates evolutionary creation. the entire roman catholic church billion people teaches the historicity of adam and eve and that does not make them young earth creationists or fundamentalists. i have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. i hope this helps. thanks talk ~0

1330~ on the way forward consider this before posting here i would much prefer it if certain people did not post on this page. so before posting please consider whether you might be described as a tendentious canvasser or drama seeker mischiefmaker advocate misrepresenter someone who piles on without clue or someone carrying over by association the disputes that they have with contributors elsewhere. if you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you and if you are an admin chillum comes to mind then find another. im not keen on this because it restricts collaboration but hey people like that basically just seem to vent poke or offer weird advice when i am the subject of their attention. im human not a saint while my ability to tolerate the types described above is not bad it is also not infinite.id be pleased if the time that you would have spent here is expended instead on editing indiarelated articles. but bear in mind that you will need to be able todeal knowledgeably with touchy and repetitivelyraised issues such as hindutva religious and casterelated povpushinghandle completely clueless newbies on a large scale many of them encouraged to edit by an illconsidered wmf initiativehandle often largescale sock and meatfarms and masses of copyvio and blp violationstake copious amounts of general abuse pretty much dailyface all sorts of physical and legal threats both on and offwiki as well as reallife stalking over prolonged periods by multiple peopleall with little or no support from the wmf and large swathes of the community who are more interested in the neverending tendentious discussion of meta issues among them policy honor and the creation of a wikitopia than actually improving content where it matters most.and when you need a break from articles that relate to per cent of the worlds population and which suffer grossly from bias systemic and otherwise go chill by creating a ga or at least a bclass article more or less singlehanded. do all of this and youll make me a very happy and surprised man. do it for kish edits without getting blocked on spurious grounds or otherwise then youll be really quite remarkable.im not saying that i will be back but if i do return id rather not see stuff here from the types of people described above. thanks. ~0

1339~=some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cultlike fashion according to some accounts the third international operatives from various countries in the s were treated virtually as cult zombies by stalins cynical bureaucrats. arguably himmlers ss included cultic formations trained at that castle wewelsburg? where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air possibly this is a street legend. as to north korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leadercult religion probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a stalinstyle personality cult since even stalin never strove for such a level of quasireligious worship and regimentation. but im not sure the term political cult is appropriate in reference to north korea since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that dont wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secretpolice power of a postrevolutionary dennis king sept ==~0

1346~ israelipalestinian conflict protect? yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this. it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc. wiki articles i have referenced why not this one? thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints. and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict. it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus. i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic. you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased. do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source? please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous. if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers. there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise. i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks. apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page. i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on wiki saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see. repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive. protection is not an endorsement of the current version. zman the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. clearly there is something seriously wrong. as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan. worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes. if the events at this article really offend you it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk ~0

1372~csd aokay sorry about that i was just really confused as to what they were pertaining to but i now see that there is a main la liga article that does provide context. thanks. sorry that was my mistake i misunderstood it. thew user i know its this guy. the article clearly should be deleted and an afd would be pointless. if i were an admin i would block him right away and delete his stuff. well blocked isnt banned. repeated block evasion might result in banning though. moreover i actually deleted an artcile of his per wikipediaarticles for deletion/quantum ring theory. that mentioned some naveen dankal so the latest account might be also be likeminded person. ill give him a welcome page and then well see. oh youre an admin? i thought there was some sort of rule that admins had to say so on their user pages.he might not be technically banned but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were. i dont know how else to deal with this. not sure about the rule but i actually forgot to restore my user page after latest wikibreak.for the moment i assume the two accounts are not the same. if not well certainly notice and can take action. heisenbergs scientific method naveen dankal with due respect to heisenberg and his contribution to science i don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidual.i have only stated some of the limitations of heisenbergs works with due references and just brought out a fact how heisenbergs method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way lopesidedness of our universe.i just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia. on the other hand i also disagree with the block you received resp. the unblock denied and have raised that point. thanks for unblocking...appreciate your step...will try to keep wiki rules in mind may well let me know once you have further concerns or questions. naveen dankal i am making a few changes in the article on heisenbergs scientific method.i would like to know wether any refernces to banned members works jeopardizes the articles chances of getting hosted or such refernces can be incorporated without any hitch. moreover before hosting the articles can they be emailed to the administrators for a review so that the users are not lead to the worries of being blocked or banned?there are two different issues. the . while that doesnt mean they can never be cited it is unlikely to go without discussion. your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations. what is missing is the intermediate step what reliable sources have written about e.g. the mystery of the scarcity of the dineutron or limitations of the copenhagen interpretation. without including such secondary sources it will be a wpsy~0

1381~ msa garratts hithe idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error. that is understandable as the subject is complex. the wagr first imported the m class garratts in . these are very important locos because they are the third class of garratt to be built and the first main line garratt showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated. so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. both classes were built by beyerpeacock.the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops. apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.the story does not end there but moves to victoria. the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. outside framed garratts are very rare even in the smaller gauges. but wait there is more no not steak knives. the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g.so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed.personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients. some work would be required to hunt down variations though. so yes i think it does deserve an article.please feel free to use the above if you wish.cheersmichael.~0

1492~ahh yes. by mormons in this instance i do mean members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints. i can see how youd read that section in this way. perhaps we can clarify what do you suggest? it is not that the doctrines changed but rather that what smith emphasized changed. what is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and as you likely know has always been the case. many things that church members believe to be doctrine is not but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members. in any case the teachings of smith and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate or that he changed doctrines or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters. we have to balance this to be historically accurate with what is believed and taught today. not an easy task. im open to suggestions in how to change wording. lets discus here and then make the changes. suggestions? also id invite you to join wikipedia. we always need newcomers. registration is easy ~0

1497~i disagree that vowel harmony is the place to discuss imutation in welsh. i see no reason why this article or umlaut and amutation for that matter should be restricted to germanic. i think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid regardless of what language its attested in. likewise amutation shouldnt be restricted to germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well again an example from welsh gwyn white masc. < windos vs. gwen white fem. < windā. umlaut should mostly be about the written sign with an indication that it also the name for processes like imutation and amutation. vowel harmony should be about the lefttoright processes typical of uralic and altaic languages. thats what i think. /comhrá~0

1500~i see what you mean. i would support using a more modern front page in the infobox as most newspaper articles do and moving the free image into the appropriate section of the article. i would not support having both images on the infobox as it looks cluttered and seems to me to push the limits of wpicondecoration.~0
1501~ utcthats because when i made those tables i classed everyone as independent unless i could confirm their party identification.according to this the dlp intended to run in all constituencies. according to this they had at least candidates. ive only been able to identify two so far so we do need to identify more. december~0
1502~ yeah i think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors arent just mere repetitions of the authors statement and dont elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. also ill like to point out these mistakes in your comment per eliade approximative understanding partly of apparently nonarabian rites so not mucheildae never says it was nonarabian. shes talking about monophysite rites and monophysite was the largest branch of christianity in arabia. per watt details that may be surmised by close analysis muhammads lifehe also argues that these verses might be attacking christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. also in the final ill like to say again the subject of the article isnt about quran and its historicity and interpretations. so adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text. ~0

1506~=the signature of the atomic bombthere are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of japan marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per october or dhu alqidah or heshavan . butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. except from this it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. first. art by artists working both before the world war ii during and after can not necessarily be defined as more or less contemporary because of this timestamp. contemporary art did explicitly exist also before world war ii as this label contemporary has been expressed as a mark of quality pertaining especially to modernism by art carrying an ideal summoning from the artist or his genius making some kind of composed expression of what in such case are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world in the event of the artmaking process including its publication or presentation. another trickster is for me that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. it is absurd as a norwegian to not consider henrik ibsen a maker of contemporary art. his plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. i sincerly believe that henrik ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed or may i say be transported by the unfolding of time. the retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the th century. i think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.~0

1591~the ezekiel passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclopædidia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to yahweh along with jeremiah .. both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable. the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god. it is cited in encyclopædia britannica moloch with the comment note also the attitude of ezekiel in xx. seq. references which cannot be explained away. the article the international standard bible encyclopedia molech moloch treats it rather strangely remarkingthat this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good and ordinances wherein they should not live ezekiel given by god to his people by way of deception and judicial punishment as some hold is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.it is not clear what this means quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold. this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to yahweh. it also brings in bogus molochworship in connection to carthage. not a good article in any case.three different rabbinical interpretations of the ezekiel passage appear at . the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning disliked by trs but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. that would not be a reason to suppress rashis interpretation and the writer does not do so.there is a discussion at which covers in part john days treatment favorably but also discusses the ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the peoples belief and apparently ezekiels beliefs that commands which ezekiel saw as bad came from yahweh. note john day believes moloch is not yahweh but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.in short the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by yahweh. it has long been in general a problem pasage. but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response which seems to me weak. but add it with a citation if you will. but do not suppress.the inclusion is not editorializing by me. i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. the ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to yahweh and normally used as support for that argument indeed one of the main sources for that argument. my own pov as much as i have one is that the evidence is confused there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to yahweh. even when when that interpretation is rejected the ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.i dont believe that anything i have included in this article including the ezekiel passage is nonstandard for discussion of moloch. i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. one obviously cannot agree with all sides. moloch cannot easily be at once yahweh an entirely different god the name of a kind of sacrifice. passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. please let the normal statements used as arguments stand regardless of the positions.i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound~0

1602~its in the history or more conveniently in your own contribs. thank you for the explanation but that wasnt a big deal. i was more upset by your second post—waving me off with a sneer about growing a thicker skin and a fingerwaggle about profanity—treating me as an insensate piece of internet polemic rather than a fellow human attempting to give an honest account of herself. an account which mackensen promptly removed as you say. well i understand that trying to contribute to the workshop was a bad idea in the first place—running full tilt into tony sidaway after managing to avoid him on irc for a whole month to the immeasureable improvement of my quality of life. anyway. ive always seen you as somebody who stands up for the underdog — i remember praising your addition of this edit to the harassment guideline—and i was sad to see there was no mutuality of respect. talk .~0
1603~users using sockpuppets in this discussion note that user nightscream is soliciting sockpuppets of toure neblett to join this discussionthis isnt surprising considering nightscreams slimy debating tactics and ad hominem smears. it looks like the reality is that there are only one or two actual people opposed to teh inclusion of the last name and the rest are their sockpuppets. though i guess it demonstrates that nightscream is not one of toures own sockpuppetsfyi i am not using a user name in this simply to make it clear i am not a sockpuppet~0
1604~comment cited academic works that have been vetted by peer review are not pov and are probably some of the hardest forms of source to contradict. when i say peer review i mean by those in academia not our own peer review process. your claims that they are an authors pov are spurious at best. the books he used are highly researched publications by noted members of their fields who spent years researching this subject.you will need some serious sources to counter those presented by chris. also before you go challenging his research i wish to remind you of chris bona fides he is a published author who is finishing his phd in gastronomy from boston university a major american university. you really need to step up if you wish to contradict his work. blah blah~0

1608~thank you. i have been trying to estimate the approx. number of rosaries made and distributed each year in the world and the number seems to be elusive. it is most probably over million per year since just one group sends out million free rosaries a year. there seem to be many manufacturers in china now although italy has many higher end rosaries.~0
1609~you have a dramatic way of expressing yourself. your specific and narrow point though about blpcrime is flawed.~0

1612~ sorry that you feel this way malangali. i dont suppose that i can persuade you but i did try and do my homework. iringa is not offically designated a city at present unlike mwanza dar and arusha you asserted this in the article but it is simply factually incorrect. a seperate question is whether iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the tz governments definition. ok. first i assure you that urban can imply either town or city particularly when contrasted with rural see urban area. i checked two english language travel guides for tanzania both of whom use town. moreover i contacted some tanzanians in iringa who agreed that it was town rather than a city not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in wikipedia just to try and convince you that the town thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint or whatever it is youve decided i am doing. i dont believe in individual ownership of wikipedia articles. however city is not the best word here and its entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. again i regret clashing with you on this and im very happy to discuss and change my mind on things and im glad youve improved this article but im afraid i will not simply agree with whatever you say just because im english and you i presume are a tanzanian. ~0

1628~speedy deletion of jacob silver a tag has been placed on jacob silver requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a person or group of people but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for biographies. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. echo ~0

1634~stooges are the nickname for the fans on murphys site... and if you want to feel all self pitying we can end this conversation now and go down the path. here is what you are not getting shitapedia is not the fbi or my university. if you want to have an encylopedic entry on me then that entry has to be accurate. simply check the laws you have huge leeway to defame celebrities and public figure and you do so freely. but that stops with a non public figure. you can try to have your cult argue that i am a public figure but when out of randomly selected people cant identify me then that game is over. as a non public figure you do not have much leeway as regards defaming me. i dont need a specialist if you are going to keep a file on me it is going to be a file that i sign off on period. unfortunately for your cultists i have some resources to fight you on that even if it is just sending people to vandalize. i am also trying to work in mocking references to the site in major films. anything to undermine you. you want me to play with you. this is my name my career my rights you dont get to tell me how to play. capisce?~0

1642~listen i know that the english of the article from which is taken the source of the little etymological asertion is a bit idiomatic but if you are a specialist of the greek language and specialist of the history of religions and you have access by your knowledge and all the references in scientific representations about the matter en question then you can verify easily the gravity of an approach that consists on thinking that a simple googling with these words fata morgana coral beads can suffice to do the job no way in the midwhile i would be glad and really happy if you can help me render the meaning of this dificult scientific linguistic idiom that uses the text and keep it in english...can you do this with me ? and for the accessibility of the scientific references in the notes i think that it is the equivalent of the book or other article references its not always accessible and nobody delete them come down this is not possible to delete everything in wikipedia that doesnt appeer to google results or has copyrighted scientifique references. ~0

1648~ ufc afds those were never transcluded to the afd page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing. im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the afd banners from the articles ill delete the afd pages when i get the chance. i havent been able to spend much time on wikipedia lately. looks like theyve been officially listed as afds. ill leave them alone for now. jake bostwick ive only nominated a few very obvious mma people before. bostwick was deleted via afd discussion. a speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied. to me he still fails wpmmanot but im in no way a mma expert. what do you think? at first glance it appears that bostwick hasnt fought at the highest level of mma as required by wpathlete or whatever the guideline is these days and wpmmanot. if i had an interest in having the article removed i would afd it again. hello it has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. can i first point out that jake bostwick is a former ucmma middleweight champion and currently the ucmma welterweight champion? ucmma is along with bamma and cage warriors the biggest mma promotion in the united kingdom. secondly after glancing over wpmmanot and wpathlete i see that they are indeed guidelines. now i may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in afds as the sole reason why to delete any article. thirdly i have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page i have found very strong sources from websites such as the sun the mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called party wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a wheel clamper only strengthens his notability. the very sources on him alone helps him pass wpgng which is all you need to pass a page on wikipedia in my opinion.i would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion i find is a bit disrespectful towards me however i fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now i have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more. userpoundpound since you filed the spi i wanted to update you that ive reversed the block. i requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation. i had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however i fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case. i completely see why you reported it i did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here. just wanted to update you. ¢ © join wer alpha chi national honor society copyright i made changes and enhancements to the alpha chi national college honor society page including citations to sources. the director of operations contacted wikipedia granting permission for material from the website to be used by wikipedia. she received a reply indicating that it was safe to move forward with the edits. nearly a month later you removed the edits. is there something im missing here?a copy of the email sent to wikipedia and the replydear lara noahthank you for your email. our response follows your message.// lara~0

1650~just to add kansas i saidyou made the elementry mistake of calling it a treaty when it was in fact a congrassis because as you left out as usual my post in which you regarded the three deligations as having been pressent at the treaty o arass with papal treaty of arass was a private treaty only between the deligations of burgundy and france and made a military alliance in we are debatting on the burgundian recognition stop changing the clearly are giving fallactious statements and i feel your posts are utterly you happend to remeber a month ago we both agreed the congrass and treaty of arass were different.i corrected your statement when you regarded the three deligations as bieng pressent at the treaty of arass.p.s stop with your childish personal attacks.i aqsked you to give sources regarding that burgundy didnt recognize henry as king of france but you give refs regarding the treaty of arass and mixing up the you cant handle the fact that burgundy recognised henry as king of france then i have already reverted you on the dualmonarchy should be ashamed of your fallactious remarks nd utterly questionable unsourced facts ~0

1761~hey. it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. you have to change this attitude on your part. your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. you guys are of course wrong. you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine. your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia. i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason. it is just plain innacurate....~0
1762~pls give clear majority to modiji lead bjp thats very important otherwise these nda partners will play around and modiji not able to take decisive steps. keeping national security in mind we need strong leadership so as of now modiji is the only option .. pls support him forget about party think about nation.. jai hind.~1

1836~i support the idea of wikicode. basically i think we should present code in a pythonlike language that doesnt carry so much baggage. for example we can use english sentences or sentence fragments instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure python library. further python has the baggage that there are no blockterminators i.e. no } or ends or fis or repeats. by adding such terminators we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers. in otherwords were basically right on track removing the quirks of python and making it higherlevel. so i support the idea myself. dec utc~0

1869~lol you know what i meant. whichever president came before hafez i just new he was president before assad has considerable foreground of support in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. they would have claimed instability would arise as assads supporters are trying to use in their defense. what i am trying to say is that although bashar assad had good economic and international policies for syria you should not fear a nonbaathist potentially being elected. syrias economic and international policies wont change iran would still be a major factor in syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms and for the better. also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. the muslim brotherhood in syria is weak even weaker than the islamist prescence in libya. the rebels in libya had % support as we see now and yet could hardly take control without nato. what chance does the syrian muslim brotherhood have? none. if anything nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the muslim brotherhood making them less of an influence in the everyday life of syrians. as you know i am pro syria and armenia just not pro assad. unlike armenia where people like sargsyan and kopcharyan were democratically elected assad was not no one ran against him because they were not allowed.~0

1878~ talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you. peter iii of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin? your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. the reasons to prefer the coin areit is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w/ a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese kingin your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. srnec the problem is that we have different criteria.you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information.i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. the two representations have the same chance of not being % accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other.if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing. but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time. i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary. do you have an argument? why are your criteria better than mine? really? when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons. but i do not want another long discussion with you. i offer consensus. would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? both of those are improvements over the thcentury image but not over the coin. at least one other editor agrees with me. sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. this discussion is already too long. both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life. either both seem right. imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. you are not allowed to impose your will. both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles. they were reviewed by several editors. stop with your edit warring. lecen is aware of the threerevert rule. are you? youve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours. you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.~0

1889~hi rpau i appreciate your comments and i agreed with most of them. i realized after you mentioned it that i needed to change the wording of one of the sentences under the career heading. i think it works a bit better now. creating hyperlinks for some key words was beneficial too. however in regards to creating a hyperlink for alex krizhevsky and ilya sutskever they are graduate students working with geoffrey hinton and do not have wikipedia pages written on them so i cant make any links for them. as for the picture of the hinton wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless i had explicit consent from the owner of the photo. i had contacted hinton previously to get some information from him personally but i got the sense that i was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses so i decided not to pursue him for the picture. thanks for your comments and criticisms though they were helpful.angelamarti thanks for your input it was quite useful.~0

1911~the titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles. you see the nature of fiction is that its not necessarily coherent. since this article is not about malcolm wilkerson in the first episode of the show malcolm in the middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. for the entire rest of the seven season run the characters name was only malcolm. this is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy. a title like malcolm xxx my appear clumsy but wilkerson is not an alternative. in my opinion. if cant build consensus on this between the two of us i suggest asking for additional input at wikipedia talknaming conventions since i didnt find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although im fairly sure the fact that the characters name was wilkerson only during the first of episodes of the show means that calling the character wilkerson esp. in the title is inaccurate. — ~0
1912~thanks. i nearly drowned when i was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath but somehow i managed to swim back on board s.s titanic. ironic really given what i see coming up ahead. perhaps i should have saved myself the trouble and just stayed in the icy water.your comments are interesting and may well be correct however they dont really address the point i was making regarding the gross almost embarrassingly obvious errors in the academic geek created/mindless computer driven financial models currently used around the world. the most similar theory to the one ive pustulated above comes out of this piece from the prophet robert k. landis where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis. ludwig von mises obviously had similar ideas but no one has really done the hard financial modelling on this austrian school theory and tried to collect longterm historical data tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels the frequency and severity of socalled black swan events in financial markets. my hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels you will see bifurcating bell curve returns i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness.landis comes close but still no cuban cigar. anyway his piece is very topical right now and made for interesting bedtime reading tucked away here as i am in my tiny little third class cabin far far away from the mad money crowd. ~0

1918~i actually hadnt even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization audio that you both have proposed. i could make the issue a little more complicated though graphic equalizer not yet written smiley face curve parametric equalization and british eq all have to do with what ill call music equalization for lack of a better term. this includes sections and of the current equalization filter along with possible future articles tone controls loudness control combine with smiley face speaker equalization etc. oh im certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles but could as well be topics in one article except that a few of these already exist separately. the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer but has become the accepted term since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someones taste not strictly to compensate for a channels frequency response.then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization or some such term which would include section of equalization filter telecommunications lines riaa equalization fm pre/deemphasis as well as equalization of nonaudio channels this is the orginal meaning of equalization. such equalizers are generally nonadjustable by a user at least and transparent to the end user. so i call it a different subject even when it is audio. anyway i dont have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems. though id be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues. come to think of it i dont have to ask for permission ~0

1953~with respect you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. getting off the subject a little but it does have some relevance the nz herald routinely refers to nzers of european descent as pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. of course i would not include this in any article and defintely not this one without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of hits for rooster found in nz media. many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry. clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the countrys readership than poultry.just stating both cockerel and rooster are used is factual whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.also i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both cockerel or rooster are common.~0

1967~ locations thailand.while phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in thailand that includes sex tourism. pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism. i dont know phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more nonsex tourists so if i were going to identify a place in thailand if not the world i would mention pattaya instead and i am tempted to edit. i hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more sex for money going on in pattaya than phuket. but for someone considering the phrase sex tourism as not necessarily pejorative i have to qualify this conclusion. note that bar girls in thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general thai population also. although i beleive that there are words in thai for prostitute they mostly at least the girls prefer to call themselves rented wifes albeit for short time rather then long time. i therefore need to be qualify my pattaya versus phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the longterm married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the wifes direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both. there is no such thing as a free lunch and everybody pays for it. note that i neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing and moreover consider them culturally aware particurlay thailand wise. the fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones one must be aware that labels concepts ideas such as sex tourism carry suggestions associated with religion particularly judeochristiamislamic jdi pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the religious worlds worldviews outside of some tribal village usually buddhist and what i like to call giesha cultures e.g. japan thailand etc versus virgin cultures typically jdi that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. note that thai society is strangely contradictory in this regard arent we all but then thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west. perhaps some historioreligious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also. i hate value laden western and religious labels that dress themselves up psuedoscientificly as culturally universal. exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more exploitation going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like chinese factories where labourers girls included work excruciating long hours for a few yuan or rmb. ~0

1977~ polytheism unless you can make a citation for polytheism i will remove it in the next week it is very misleading and infact the cited sky god and the monotheistic zoroastrian and vedas and general monotheistic spirituality of the pies does not support this polytheism.infact polytheism is a bad word as godthe oneness that which can be no greater is completely different from gods and thus you can have deities or gods yet still be monotheistic.. only really the abrahamic religions ban this deity and call it paganism.anyway please remove polytheism or cite it~0

1982~ideas ideas hey hows it goin ginkgo? i had a couple ideas i wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought you’re the editor. heres what’s going on in my headfirst i was looking at the bill ritter politician article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. you scored that good shot of ritter at the cdc and thats about all the color weve got. so i stopped by ritters campaign site and found a great screenshot off kusa of the latest poll numbers drop by and take a look if you can. i thought maybe this might be worth uploading if applicable didnt check yet and using in the ritter article and colorado gubernatorial election . what do you think?in a related thought i stumbled upon the video of the ritter/beauprez debates from aug. heres a link . other articles ive read have contained video but this one might be a little to long any thoughts? and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto wikipedia.second im going to plunge into a cleanup effort that looks a little challenging over at national western stock show take a look and youll see what i mean. if you can and you like whats one of my favorite events in denver drop by the article and help me out a little.thanks for the help ive written a lot here my apologies. see ya around have a good one.~0

1993~ north korea actually gained approximately km² from china in the treaty. and heres a th century book by chong yagyong titled koreas northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by peter hacksoo lee a long time ago the area north of the tumen river was the land of the sushen people. it has not been under our control since the time of the three han. the southern slopes of mount changbaek where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters lay within our territory but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. however emperor kanghsi in the final years of his reign ordered area commander wula wula tsungkuan muketeng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. as a result the border between those two rivers is clear as well. emphasis mineheres another study of the usnorth korea border in by the us dept of state which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain. and another which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in . the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border and of course a few ultranationalist sites but please enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. on another rather amusing note it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits and which prefer to judge a book by its cover and lash out emotionally. should be made in a new section on the talk page. no further edits should be made to this section. the result of the debate was no move. requested movechonji → tianchi – the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus for pov reasons cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean its on the border between china and korea. another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well. however a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi and and less than each for chonji and cheonji. thats two orders of magnitude in difference. the preceding was quoted by yuje surveyadd support or oppose followed by a brief explanation then sign your opinion with support for the most common name. searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake. the use of chonji as a clear common name doesnt apply because its not common. support — per yuje. naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. oppose per visviva and my previous comments. like i said before we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china. as shown chonji is nowhere near common. chonji barely shows up any hits therefore isnt a viable alternative for a clear alternative name. oppose look at my reason below. comment the proposition seems to be flawed... given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else perhaps tianchi changbaishan or even heh heh tianchi paektusan but then again maybe tianchi jilin... if we must have a straw poll it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is. comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldnt be ignored. thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi disambiguation page. either one is a reasonable alterna~0
1994~ november utc and i dont believe this is just a minor set back. and i wish you understood the gravity of it all especially thibbs who has seen this behavior overall even in my own talkpage. but like i said the torture is not even knowing what the disruption even was. i would like a direct answer please. thibbs you are the one who pushed for a consensus and claimed it to be necessary even when it was confirmed broadly construed.im willing to work on several articles that appeal to my current schedule and need to have an interest in the subject . wpvg and wpanime had allowed me to access mostly online sources. so i would like some that can be up to ga class using mostly free online sources. i would also like to participate in a wikiproject that definitely gives me enough room to start. i dont have the time to look for something completely online.but only if someone can give me an answer. im going to say it again it is torture trying to move on in wikipedia and knowing absolutely nothing. ~0
