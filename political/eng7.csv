12007,reconsidering st paragraph edit?i dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that im sure that the data are necessarily wrong. rather im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject. i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement. in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. a. benjamin cardozo a. learned hand b. john marshall harlan b. john marshall harlan iithe question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? i think not.perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale.at a minimum im questioning this edit? it deserves to be reconsidered. ,0

12009,section subdivisions should be more than a list. i hate to complain about a problem rather than just fix the problem but i really dont know enough about biology to be productive here.the problem i read eudicots rosids and asterids. although each article lists some representative species i the reader have no understanding what criteria was used to subdivide eudicots into rosids and asterids and others. why is one plant a rosid but not an asterid? these articles read as though plant life is subdivided arbitrarily though i suspect the subdivision is somewhat rational. my intuition tells me that there must be some expressible meaningful distinction between these subgroups.the proposal is there some way to describe the grouping here? i propose a brief summary of the characteristics which divide rosids and asterids. i think this summary should be a list of differences each difference taking this form rosids feature x. in contrast asterids feature y.thanks ...,0

12014,addressingwhile indian tribe is official us govt lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur dalene people once inhabited acres ha in northern idaho and washington and montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur dalene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties idaho. you dont have to use my wording but you see how i am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined. .  boomer second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. id put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway? keep the chronology clearer. interesting that the coeur dalene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm from a very cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter. the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case.,0

12020,first off modern computergenerated ornate renderings of the paleohebrew yhuh/yhwh and modern hebrew tetragrammaton were added in the article anyway. mine were of anthropological resources my friend prof. james greenberg university of phoenix anthropologist.the w in yhwh was not intended to represent not of the yod as the ancestry but of the ancestry of roman w back to the aramaic u and then the paleo y.the transliteration of the en vowel u whether a u vowel or ǖ vowel instead of vvor w consonant and the better pronunciation. for example ability for pronunciation of the greek letter upsilon changed in soundvalue from a u vowel to an umlaut or frontrounded ǖ vowel was relevant to the tetragrammaton as far as the representation by many that there are no vowels in the tetragrammaton. and third yahusha as in the same tetragrammaton of yahshua ref. strongs concordance sha for deliverer and shua for scream or cry does existed in hebrew so is not completely bogus as a supposed historical divine name... anonmoos talk ,0

12029, more description of location please? hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is? i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful. i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. what do you think? any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful. i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you. thanks and best wishes ,0

12042,response to the disappearance of madeleine mccanni reverted your edit because you give partial information not because of the wording i prefer. what parts do not make sense? the ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? stop saying it is bad english if it was just that youd fix it without removing information.garcia added that when the pj is criticized then the british police are also criticized because of their close cooperation what you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the portuguese article it is not just close cooperation it was created a joint working group right from the start with the british police. this is why the british police are also criticized. just close cooperation they have with the interpol the europol and other police organizations. no working group was created with them. i hope it is clear. several unfair critics were made to the methodology used by the portuguese police. garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by portuguese and british police. other facts indirectly related to the different methodologypersonnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as forging evidence he gonçalo amaral was the victim of personal attacks by the british media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman but also attacked him as a human being. portugal has unsolved cases of missing children under including madeleine.in spite of all the resources available and the different methodology the uk has unsolved cases of missing children under in the last four years.national missing persons bureau. it seems that the british methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. besides thisthe uk has a serious problem with child trafficking a serious problem with african children that just go missing no criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the control risks group hired by the mcanns since may. the investigation of the pj weve stated all along has the most likely chance of us finding her something made them change their minds?the use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with childrens abduction and trafficking that the uk has. i hope it was clearly written and the parts of it do not make sense start to make sense.i am going to revert the edit you are welcome to correct any bad english not the information.i am sure my portuguese is better than yours. ,0

12300,automatic protection for main page? it would be straightforward to write a bot that protected all images on the main page adding templatemprotected and unprotected all images with templatemprotected that no longer appeared on the main page. feature would be genuinely useful and save editors work. however if editors came to rely on feature then that would introduce a risk because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. a clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. and worse the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image. i suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become. may utc,0

12306,the organization of subtopics. culture is thrown way down towards the end after economy and tourism which is inappropriate. the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography which makes it not only uninteresting but also repetitive. information is interspersed all through the subsections without regard to whether or not they fit there. eg the geography section starts with the fact that up is the th largest state. that is not strictly geography and belongs in the introduction. climate belongs towards the latter part of the page perhaps before toursim. regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. in any case cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own because up has several interesting cities and regions each with specialities of its own like the copperware of moradabad ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi. in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before. ,0

12334,centrifugal force acroterion recently you took an interest in the centrifugal force page. i would be most grateful if you could look at the recent deletion of my edit on the main page of that article. if you check it out you will find that wolfkeeper has a long record of deleting things which i put on the main article.when i put that edit on yesterday i was fully expecting wolfkeeper to delete it. but i was very careful to make sure that the edit contained only basic textbook material and that there could be no possible grounds to justify him deleting it.you will recall that my block last week was because i was accused of incivility by having accused wolfkeeper of wikistalking for having deleted stuff that had put on the main page.interestingly wolfkeeper has attempted to justify his actions this time. his first reason was pathetic. it was something to do with the section being out of place. the second reason merely exposes wolfkeepers total lack of knowledge about the topic in question.the marble experiences a side on coriolis force as it rolls out to the edge of the turntable. interestingly physusie who i presume was attempting to back up wolfkeeper has then come in and stated this very fact as if it were me that didnt know it.if you are genuinely interested in justice on wikipedia and proving that there is no corruption i would be most grateful if you could monitor the ensuing debate very carefully.i know that you say that you are not trained in this topic but it is all very basic stuff and i am sure that you will be more than capable of seeing exacly what is going on.,0

12339,yep that all makes perfect sense and the move is uncontroversial with me and the pages creator with whom i discussed this a bit on the talk page when i made my initial illfated moves. just to clarify what i was after with singular v. plural so as not to appear a plodding dolt i meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre. a point of general interest the other singular pinakes listed in the suda entry arent considered parts of the work known as the pinakes that being πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν. i dont know that i believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments but who am i? going this route id actually be alright with no mention of the/any pinakes appearing on the pinax page this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at athens. thanks for looking at this and i hope that i can get back to that article soonish and will be thinking about the extracallimachean angle that need to be pursued—please let me know if any other names come to mind.,0

12369,march utcyes the presentation of god and cosmology in tub is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. if one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way i can think of to describe it npov. npov though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship origin and unusual unique presentation that has caused various types of pov to surface in debate true not true religion philosophy etc. i searched in some online libraries at the library of congress and even wrote to the urantia foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. so far i found it listed under scientific religion religion nonfiction cults and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the loc. the book itself says it is an epochal revelation which is the fifth to the planet. it describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding god deity and divinity. religious science scientific religion esoteric cosmology religious cosmology what? perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article while increasing it at the same time i think. what are your thoughts? you know if we wrote that the urantia book is an epochal revelation containing religioscientific cosmology... there would then start more pov debating. ,0

12387,i was requested to provide an opinion here by comfykem. everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both and thats sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. however theres no reason in principle why each cant have an article as long as there is sufficient distinctive reliably sourced material in each to merit that. this appears to be the case here just about though bloating the lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful. if we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species as plantdrew suggests it would probably be best to have it at the species name as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.,0

12412,hi jay. the source that youve used the strategy written by mccaffrey is okay but it would be very good if you would also mention some thirdparty source that discusses or describes the strategy. in the lingo of wikipedia i think the strategy itself is called a primary source but wikipedia generally prefers secondary sources. i can look for secondary sources for this if youd like. also perhaps a bit more concise? for example i dont think its really significant that mccaffrey recognized that illegal drugs remain widely available which is common knowledge. cheers. ,0

12439,okay i disagree with this just as strongly as i disagree with attempts to say he wasnt jewish. firstly marx didnt kill anybody nor did his ideology. a bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people. and given that the german people managed to produce some unquestionably german people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people im not going to weep for the fact that the germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century. beyond that marx was born and grew up in germany with a very limited connection to his jewish ancestry. his primary language was german and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works. although he spent most of his later life in england ive never really heard that he didnt always consider himself to be a german id think in fact that living in england would have accentuated that. while i do think that his jewish background is important and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a jew his german background was substantially more important than his jewish one. his own works emerged out of posthegelian debates within the german philosophical community and his greatest influence throughout his life and for several decades afterwards was in germany where marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of europe britain france and russia in particular had their own nonmarxist socialist traditions that were not assimilated into marxism for a long time if ever. marx was german of jewish descent. being an internationalist is a statement of intentions for the future of the world not of present day identity. ,0

12456,there are many inaccurate statements being posted here. far too many i dont have time to correct all of them. the bnp was modernised by nick griffin and has no links to holocaust denial or nazism. digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant. you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories. during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that? another example the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis. so they went from being antidrug to prodrug. the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial. secondly the comment about nick griffin and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antibnpers. what nick actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden. likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the nazis. also the last claim modern bnp members sieg heil i presume was a comical claim. it has no basis in fact. bnp are strongly against nazism and fascism. if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. is that democratic? you might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently.,0

12565,elellandhello humusi am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot. i m very inexperienced with wikipedia. i was enthralled by wikipedia. initially. that is until i met eleland. i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland. eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted. he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.the article was on ed oloughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent. the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. he was amongst the candidates for this years dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.so i studied eleland a little.ive looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict. more than were directly antiisrael. his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the proisrael side. in this way he has undermined many many articles.personally i dont care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc. i think there is a problem.wikipedia is i am afraid beginning to read like eleland wrote the script.who is eleland? what power does he actually have?can anything be done?adon emmetif you post a reply here i will contact here or even by email,0

12690,as you kinow it yourself you are not elligible nor credible nor a reliable source of neutrality in this case as you are yourself a mormon and all you do is to support other mormons without following any wikipedias rules but your own churchs solidarity.i dont believe that any of you has even the intention of being straightforward with non mormon or to be a little bit honest but that the alone thing that activate you is your own religious believe and the pedantisme to think that all you may say or do is auto righteous in the name of the church and all the illusions you dream of with open eyes.i dont want a mormon admi i dont want a mmormon admi i dont want a mormon admi to look into this case but an exterm¨n al one with no relations nor conacts what so ever with this church nor its representants or members.if you cant do that must be because your circle of admi friends is around the church or because you know very deeply that all you did was deeply unappropriate and wont stand a micro mile in a wiki trail.i am mad very mad at you also because you ignore what i have say so why should i care about your saying and doing if we have to be neutraly equal?any idea?i want the text who was deleeted from the archive it is unacceptable that a text is deleeted from archive and from the edit history just one hour after it was reverted and less than a day after it was written without any previous warning of any kind about it.this is all about wiki rules and you have broken them all.,0

12813,new louisville definitionsince the census bureau has clearly defined the new louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas i think there some details needed that need to be added defining metro government. first it is important to note that a ky legislative bill dubbed the lyndon bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. if this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left. second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. third even if suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for metro mayor and council members and will still receive metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.personally i think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the census bureau says. the smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city. your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. what you are referring to is the louisvillejefferson county balance which is not the same thing as consolidated louisvillejefferson county. both are defined separately by the census bureau see here. this article is about the consolidated louisvillejefferson county which is how the city is legally incorporated. the confusion lies in the census bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures. although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings. the census bureau has accepted the louisville/ jefferson balance but not the city/county consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses. because of the acceptence of the lou/jef balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. if this were not the case then the balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.your assertion is not entirely correct. the census bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated louisvillejefferson county in their estimates. they also include a separate figure for the balance louisville/jefferson countykentuckya louisville/jefferson county balancekentuckyathats from the estimates the last number is the estimated population. this article is not about the balance however. issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page. actual population there are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. according to the census bureau estimates the balance population is and not anywhere near . what is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed? i do not believe that louisville has a population anywhere near that of columbus ohio. we need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. there are several pages in wikipedia listing the population as or so when the census lists the population as . i understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. if it was a city i lived in i would like to do the same. however that cannot be done here. an actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. if we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. i am a little confused myself and i did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed. there have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article. please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation. since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — userstevietheman,0

12832, the burke group in response i never provided where he went to school. i added he is a j.d. rather than delete he is a j.d. juris doctor then refer to him as dr. david burke? a j.d. is a doctor of jurisprudence same as a ph.d. why do you allow personal information thats good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more? he was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying he owns a rental property in agoura hills with a meaningless political contribution? the property posted is a rental where he no longer lives and maybe never did. how is that useful in an article about organized labour? you said it yourself the article should be about the company. but in actual fact he is the company. hes a flight instructor whom i know from our fbo flight base operation. lots of people know him. he hasnt contributed to republicans for years. look at the site you provided last one was . why continue to keep outdated useless information? the article cited by dr. john logan a very learned fellow contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. even he can make mistakes. i am a lawyer and logan is a british economist and may understand e.u. law but does not understand u.s. labor law. just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it. there is no newspaper article about cdn that says employees were awarded from the court of appeals. he wrote incorrectly. the citation provided which corrects his article is from the court dockets. which is a better citation? i provided the citation from the law firm that won the civil case against cdn i removed nothing about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between nlrb law and dol law and civil actions filed with the district courts. what john logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the f.a.a. but tried at the d.m.v. are you british? f.a.a. is federal aviation admin. and d.m.v. is dept. of motor vehicles. they are not related anymore than nlrb is to district court or civil cases.. burke works in nlrb jurisdiction and the case you cite is a civil action in district courts not related. if you want cdn discussed first part is fine but the civil action is not. there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for cdn. logans article used as a citation lacks any credible legal citation connecting burke to the civil case. only a legal citation should be used. there are none available. djb is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. no matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed. if you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right. am i being picky? yes. inside the law you cant just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks. deleting facts for fiction is beneath the dignity of what wikipedia has strived to promote. why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions? how is that possible when wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more? you think the sum total for the reader should be that burke owns a rental property in agoura hills? how is that related to the burke group? please stop the generalities and provide facts i contributed and tell me exactly how the citation or tone can be improved and let me do that. also please define what is meant by tone. by the way...are you a wikipedia staff editor or administrator? thank you. arabianrider ,0

12842,possible imagesso i just removed a huge mate ad from the article because in my opinion although i believe it was added in good faith by userkrw its inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class. some examples i looked at included soft drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf with a photo of the diet pepsi product line much lower down potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging and the third is a noncurrent ad fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped and only the big mac is clearly identifiable plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown. this brings up a quandry what do we use for images? my best ideas are to make mockups of a hypothetical dating site front page or ad and use them instead of real images. suggestions?,0

12900,articles ive just deleted the bugrr team or however that was spelled and notice other deletion requests on other articles here. i also read your note on that articles talk page and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of wikipedia. we only allow articles on subjects that are notable generally this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple independent reliable sources. that means that a company thats just recently started that has never produced a product and that by the way those were written seem closer to a group of friends is not a suitable subject for a wp article. basically if you cant find a number of newspaper etc. articles discussing the company it shouldnt have an article. i hope this explains why these articles were deleted.in connection to this i need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type. continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators and these are clearly nonnotable companies so much so that we used the expedited speedy deletion process.,0

12926,== unblock requests =={{unblock reviewed=sorry for my blurb here i went in detail elsewhere. if an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology they will notice that ive been patient while i had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. that creates a very stressful situation. please see here for outside opinion. i did not use the same kind of language against hrafn and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while i added content to the article. i was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it even before the afd process. i noticed it was a stub and started to add content. how am i being disruptive to other there when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? i even listed potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be an editor of astrotheology and add content. hrafn on the talk page even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. it is obvious he was against something but that something wasnt me like he thought and he couldnt believe otherwise or choose not to. somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment i got from hrafn to where durova stepped in and it went directly to arbcom. she did ask about pastordavid but i looked and i left evidence on an/i of why i didnt accept his offer that is not a refusal to dispute resolution that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an afd. i felt another mentor/mediator would be best. personal attack/comment redacted by if you look however i did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to hrafn about rs/n over the physicotheology book... he didnt answer at all to that question but he went on to despise me instead with more egregious misintrepretations. as for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that durova noted those werent because of disruptive editing. i never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. if you seriously think i did it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. the previous mediation was recommended by a mentor comments redacted by i hate the show the mistakes she made also we arent allknowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? the computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why i got blocked before. after unblock the consensus continued and it still sustains today. if i truly was trying to disrupt like durova claims dont you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. comment redacted by it would be a test to see if she requests unblock but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again i really doubted her olive branch. i deleted a section here on my talk page of her vanish forever bit. i simply did not reply to her comment redacted by you can argue all you want that i changed the section title which policy does allow for neutral view comments redacted by when arbcom said this is obvious i truly dont think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help offer to help mediate. i saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides pastordavids. however i sent an email to ask her why... why.. why..... but now she is calling it obscene and offers to show it to any admin. if you read itcomment redacted by like i said on an/i...decline=reason — not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words the gd word primarily to his opponents. i see no reason to unblock. the consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle and the community has handled. june ,0

12934, dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. this isnt a list of people who kinda sorta theres a small chance maybe are transgender.the ones who crossdressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it. the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is guan yin. the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something e.g. military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered.the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too? also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact.and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to ed wood? you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them. that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.maxwell klinger wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army. anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality. whats the association between the two?also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here. ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. june utc,0

12992, may utcas far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore. thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the crossover connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology. as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe only star wars takes place in an entirely different futurepast element basically a universe that predates that of the earth. and tolkiens universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm the same applies to dungeons dragons world of warcraft and warhammer. however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c.s. lewis and hans christian anderson/brothers grimm. harry potters world also doesnt tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen. and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tiein is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesnt the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present. perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole. piecraft ,0

13055,well in case anyones interested in following up on this further using the la trobe university online search engine a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ truncated to allow for various inflections leads to bjt record hits at least of which are in the pali canon. heres the first page of the search results with links to the subsequent pages as well . of course this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term nor what this term means in the context of various suttas since multiple records can be part of a single sutta. similarly this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term etc.. fwiw a quick review of these results potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words e.g. netti peta one in the abhidhammas kathavatthu once in the visuddhimagga and times in the pali histories. if nothing else this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by peter and myself might possibly be among? the core texts. with metta talk ,0

13071, answer to osli those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open onesidedness with serbs and/or milosevic see znet resource for example. when you mention bosniak sources who are you referring to? do you consider the international tribunal a bosniak source? srebrenica massacre is heavily based on internationa tribunals rulling e.g. radislav krstic judgement and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist garbage with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. the bottom line is alternative views do not matter what matters is coldharded facts from such sources as international tribunal human rights watch statesponsored research documentation centre international missing association or whatever the official name is etc. when it comes to editing this article in a rational matter you are the only one who rejects international tribunals version of the article and seeks serbian or proserbian version of the article. as you can see you are not succeeding and your edits dont stay longer than couple of hours. people will not stand for your version of the article because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by international crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources. ,0

13098,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory. it cant because langan is not a member of academia. but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable. for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions.byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. this is correct. to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions. however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral. unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal. he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself. by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu. this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well. oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously. ,0

13222, trying to measure the number of cafes this is one of those places where i am so frustrated by wikipedias ban on original research. the article has the absurdly low at least six cafes on the ave or its alleys. i dont know where that number comes from nor what they consider a cafe but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition the scene includes solstice cafe zoe the original allegro on an alley parallel to the ave arguably its second location in the college inn also counts the ugly mug half block off the cafe at the corner of nd that used to be the roma but i cant recall its new name sureshot the continental caffe apassionato wow bubble tea shinka tea company yunnie bubble tea pochi tea gingko tea house tullys starbucks wannabee one block off still life on the ave at the grand illusion technically the entrance is around the corner but it is clearly effectively on the ave.this doesnt even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints nor does it count things like u. bookstore and bulldog news both of which have busy espresso operations nor does it count ice cream stands. and im sure im missing something this is all just offhand. talk ,0

13230, musings hey fridaywhile blocked the past two days i read through your subpages. things like /admin etc. they are greatim burning out on this project editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past ive received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me. i also saw that im not the only one whos been on the receiving end of this. ive seen it all but its too long to go into here. im not sure if these are new trends or just something i havent spent the time to look into before. mere editors really have little recourse in this. filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past. it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an outofline editor. filing against an admin would i assume be much much worse. admins seem to behave like innercity police with their wall of silence.a lot of your comments show that youve noticed the same happenings. in an ideal world i think you are right people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen. i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies. we need to define what something like disruption is. when someone is blocked for a personal attack the diff should be included. that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change weve tried the trust admins to do what is right. it has failed. ,0

13272,hitler was innocent... there are several groups that want to rewrite history to make germany the innocent player. a particulary fine example of this nonsense is .some of this article reads a bit weasily that germany was on the back foot and had to attack.i particularly note that the article stated that hitler made a peace offer before the battle. i changed this toon october he may have made some type of peace offer to both western powers. any statement along these lines needs to be made very carefully what were the offers and what are the sources for the information.,0
13273,hadnt seen that. a lot of material to cover. i am getting an education. but ill be be plain. there has has been a lot of quotation mining on this page from various povs. it is what directed me to start reading talk in the first place and to decide to start editing myself. good wiki pages demonstrate a synthesis of sources. it is easy to spot when that is not happening particularly if you have ever been involved in collaborative writing before. a few quick reference checks on the stinkiest stuff such as grover whitehurst appearing to skewer david elkind proves that it is happening. all subject matter aside i detest this. if someone takes the time to write an academic article or produce a journalistic piece or enter into a public point/counterpoint debate others who want to reproduce their thoughts have a moral obligation to summarize the original source authentically. criticism of it is obviously fine but only after the original piece has been accurately summarized. imho. ,0

13279, i already know the map from john speed but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoye/suraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors. the deutschen dont call themselves germans germanen or alemanes alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word suryoye/suraye was mistranslated into assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists. do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the th century and in their own words which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity? the syriacorthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate suryoyo with oromoyo in their own words. interestingly the arameans from maalula who are either christian melkites or muslims call their aramaic language/dialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoythaaramoytha which is a result of greekchristian influence on the arameans. the word suryoyo which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites catholics or melkites. nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. even if the word suryoyo derives from assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name. ,0

13337,hi. we have three members already. we all seem interested in the project. i have created a template to place on articles talk pages. an user from the spanish wikiproject has just suggested that we translate articles from one wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator but noone responded yet. one of the members is interested in writing about gay literature and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or lgbt literature. i believe this was the first discussion of the project. two of us think that lgbt literature would be best. i dont have a lot of time to dedicate to the project so i would like it if it didnt depend on me to survive and grow and be successful. the other two members have asked what they can do for the project. i would like to write something to better explain what a wiki project is for because this seems unclear. i believe its not much of a big deal its just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place so if something important happens concerning that subject for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know. it should also create a sense of community and its good to have that since well be editing the same articles. i think things are going fine except that i dont know whether the other members see this as i do.,0

13347, good policy suggestion on class assignments. my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. i think your looks like a good idea and i support it. its especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced thoughtful edits to psychology articles here as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. keep up the good work. talk an appology is in order dear colini am not sure if you will have the chance to read this or if youll have a moment to respond but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article. however before i go any further may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. i will not try to make excuses for my actions nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them. i realise and no doubt others will too that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t. and most importantly i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. though i can understand where you are coming from i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the longrun. i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge please do not blackout our privaleges to use and edit articles. let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school. looking to make this a better placecivcodex thanks. we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia. what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate. talk · contribs · email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page. °talk proposed new policy id like to advertise this very draft proposed new policy . comments please. °talk i think the central dillema is this a student could make a poorquality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. if the grading rubric was accurate a student would receive or negative credit. my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment increase their wikipedia knowedge and improve the grading rubrics themselves. im fairly proud of education programsaint louis university/signal transduction sp which i helped write. you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re how the community reacts to profs and students. the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies in the first place and we are often more unkind than necessary in the second. i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt. –  + barnstars { style=border px solid gray backgroundcolor fdfferowspan= valign=middle rowspan= style=fontsize xlarge padding verticalalign middle height .em the barnstar,0

13372,well arthur i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what says it is not your correction. it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless.you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. so lets do that.we want a function f satisfying f=e and fn+=expfn defined as widely as possible. we observe that n= and n= present no problems f= and f=.to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as .and we want f to be continuously differentiable. the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on . this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because a=e.next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f is monotone on the interval . from the functional equation fx = ln fx+ we get f x = f x+/fx+. hence f =f /f=f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx = expxexpxx.thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and .,0

13493,xenodontlikeit typically when xenophrenic sees a valid edit by wiki policy that he disapproves of for whatever reason he seeks to get others to remove it. this strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance or needs the proper context or isnt the full story etc. there are many different reasons used but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense > to ratio in his pov that average editors cringe when they see it. xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced pov version can only stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. this leads to edit warring over days and even weeks articles often get locked down. some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. some call this tactic a form of wikiterrorism i say it shows that xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent not a terrorist even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.,0

13602,tangential forces the tangential forces coriolis and euler can be applied to a system but they dont occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism but that is off topic.during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two.we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like. the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained corotating radial motion.in a rotating frame of reference with nonuniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially.in a keplerian orbit there will be zero tangential acceleration although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force.having said all this tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. the centrifugal force is an outward radial force.more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the radial distance variable.they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.,0

13637,thanks for the speedy reply and the links. after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit perhaps in a table form that can be added too or removed as needed rather than a vague catch all description.for example after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldnt be done alone. aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. im not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didnt really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.,0

13687,=== page is in rough shape ===with the recent purge of content the page is not as informative as it once was. the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed. one editor may appear to hate since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog. also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog. meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content. for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work and the link to reciprocity is not online and the topic not a major issue. both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available.in order to be bold i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content including from sources that are not government funded. basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening. barring this broadened content eligibility we all need guidance for what is eligible content and perhaps what makes ineligible. the content there was written in and has been adopted whether independently or without attribution by other authorshere is the major recent deletion . specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced. some of these can be sourced elsewhere but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy dont spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do. basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients or find and punish abusers. basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions such as social security in the us is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation. balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work. better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up. smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction. viewed this way the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation. social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically with less requirement on charity and welfare. it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income. its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner. natural finances definition of social dividends variable basic income tax revenue surplus over social program expenses essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic productivity and automation growth. the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.,0

13709,help clarify an artice john stark i was looking for information on john stark and came across a confusing section. in the part about his early life there is a paragraph that readson april while on a hunting and trapping trip along the baker river a tributary of the pemigewasset river he was captured by abenaki warriors and brought back to canada but not before warning his brother william to paddle away in his canoe though david stinson was killed. while a prisoner of the abenaki he and his fellow prisoner amos eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.the problem is that there is no mention of who david stinson is only that he was killed. i see that an edit you made january ‎ removed some clarification on him instead identifying amos eastman as the fellow prisoner. as you have better knowledge on the subject can you please put back some info identifying him? or possibly remove the unclear info??thanks,0

13770, please remain civil. you may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article. you keep conflating my changes with those of someone else. the use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and i didnt make that change. you keep reverting all changes wholesale including changes made for reasons purely of style rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you. we have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that bradley manning is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action. you complain about blp but accepting claims about bradley mannings guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious blp policy violation. until the claims of lamo and the us government have been established in a court of law we cannot use the wordofgod to state their claims are true. as for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted. we are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted who clearly states that mannings treatment amounts to torture. ,0

13781,dunfermline article and new pictures for the kirkcaldy collage hello again. ive been looking at the paragraph about the kingsgate shopping centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the s specifically between and if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years. but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway. about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources.also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference kingsgate extension on schedule for august opening by mivan. as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status. thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the kingsgate and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date. that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to mutt luckers home page. it is now on his talk page if you want to see it mutt lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the beveridge park pond. as well as this i have another new picture of the old kirk tower which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website the clock has been restored since that pic. and would like to upload it.,0
13782, bloc voting countries with large populations of nonnationals may have their televote influenced considerably. this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia. this is fullblown crazy. what does nonnationals mean? these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa. people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries there are some refugees in each of those countries but that doesnt really explain why croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to serbia or macedonia to serbia where there was no conflict to speak of. for example im a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual. but im not a bosnian nonnational. i have the passport of bih and my family has never lived in serbia in history. its really about mutual intelligibility which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. its the language and sensibility.,0

13785, colorado balloon incident greetings. i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon. unfortunately wikipedias use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts. its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia. refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article. wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents. the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. ive been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.i hope i havent given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as i do especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. thanks for your contributions ,0

13800, note the current lead implies israeli aggression against hamas by stating that israel killed several hamas members in khan yunis on july and hamas retaliated with rockets. i have been trying to seek consensus for including the israeli claim that hamas started firing rockets circa june at drn. however it may also be worth noting that israel maintains the hamas members killed in khan yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as israels deadliest attacks in which six palestinian militants died though israel denied any involvement...the israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern gaza area of rafah on the egyptian border where the hamas gunmen died. military spokesman lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into israel. it turns out the same account was given by the new york times when hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives there...hamas blamed israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation. hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an israeli airstrike is not an assertion wikipedia should parrot uncritically. ,0

13880, i feel like i cant improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved the person i said it to and who did the block hours after the conversation was over. if as said that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong. when i posted that message and i still havent heard from the block admin that its content was the issue i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal human to human level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person rather than having us both resort to the standard drawnout wikiprocedures. so far at least onwiki that editor has had no reaction to what i said while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions and me only able to appeal on this page.,0

13900,i understand your point. i simply do not believe it to be valid. during the period in question the rc church did not have large armies at its disposal. it relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. in france louis a loyal catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. the rc church at this time were also opposed to this principle one that has become so widely accepted in western societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before. louis with the tactic support of leading churchman ordered acts of antiprotestant terror. lets be completely honest without the tactic approval of the church would a devout catholic have been committed to such a course of action? some leading churchman celebrated the outcome a france almost completely cleansed of protestants. now in all the material the criticism of the rc church is so obviously implied that this shouldnt need reemphasising. a modern historian would not write the following is a criticism of the rc church... that is how junior school children begin their english composition answers ,0

13904,skywriter i have tried to be civil with you. i would ask that you return the favor. remember i didnt even write the old lede i picked that as merely being most likely to be noncontroversial. also note that on every single edit page theres a big statement saying if you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it. part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing. its nothing personal.if you see no evidence that kinzers book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran then you did not read the book or the reviews.amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is merely how good one is. but whatever you didnt include a direct mention in the most recent version so lets just drop this. and for about the billionth time since you mention in my edit summary that im criticizing kinzer.... im doing no such thing. im sure the book is very good judging from the review given by the cia history fellow. but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself. people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong so this was not a new revelation.aggression aside snowfire the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address. if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording feel free to bring it here for comment. i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede and now its a windy analysis. got it. but aside from sniping you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing. it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede. there are a million and one possible sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede we have to pick which ones. i have no doubt that your text was sourced it doesnt mean its automatically appropriate for the lede.yes and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. fast and loose with factslet me say it again are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup? do you realize what references are for? its to confirm facts. this fact is obvious and supported by every source including your own so it doesnt particularly matter what it was referenced to. if you want to source it better have a blast but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts.albrights apologyyouve got a point that the linked nytimes article doesnt call it apology. remember i didnt write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than wed like.the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup. however the cias accounting published in three years after the publication of kinzers pathbreaking book must be weighed against the cias destruction of most of its documents related to this coupwait the cia destroyed the documents so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it? that logic doesnt flow. more to the point the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source. i havent read all the shahs men but from your linked book review the one by a notable person not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that too i quote..eisenhower and his secretary of state john foster dulles were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscows machinations.kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen.by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. lastly mossadeqs naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh partys efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions. he seemed almost blithely unaware that prosoviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe. by not reining in irans communists he fell on washingtons enemies list. ....yeah. as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source. also note that dulles is described as moralistic i.e. interested in stopping the communists not greedy / interested in oil. squares with what i know of dulles anyway.the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol,0

13937,just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.in some cases it is probably appropriate and actually used just like a surname in a legitimate but different broader sense than that used by our surname article and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere by the person. thats probably especially true of radio personalities with an onair name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name ive seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names. but as a general rule no. some like annmargret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. the problem of course is that our articles especially the stubs and substubs often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on. if it is mary lou or something of the sort common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself it should clearly be under m in any category the redirect which should be there or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful. but in between there is a huge variety that youll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories and there are lots of them. even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesnt even appear in the articles own name. ,0

13939,as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to. it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in not polesti. raf bomber command used an attack by the af to attack this target.the days loses were as already given. specifically spitfire claims were not discussed so the spitfires percentage of the kill total is unknown which is conveyed in the article.more importantly citations have been given for for the order of battle figures. your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. oob are given in lists as you should know so your give me a quote tone is rather silly. caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. he gives known strength returns. as for total german day fighter strength again this estimated by caldwell as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete. he points out and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september . in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time while alone were available for combat in the west. german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time. even considering that all e.f fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts negating even the med. theatre. so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false. ,0

13953,how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? also just because a word has a historical meaning doesnt mean that it cant ever mean anything else as culture develops. the word rap meant to knock as on a door up until the late s for example. would you deny the more modern use of the term? the english language has no board to regulate it as french does with the lacadémie française so you have no basis for defining what the word means. we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like youre and your for example but none such for words like bukkake. if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way that is valid. my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier gay just as there is no need to call men having anal sex gay anal sex but thats really irrelevent. i think it is important to make clear the historical implications but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything but specifically semen and specifically onto a persons face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it. ,0
