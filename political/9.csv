16002,george noory radio talk show oct thanks.on oct at pm antigray wrotehi jackthey were talking about you and uri geller and others involved in doing mind control stuff mostly. they should repeat the show this evening in your area. they do that here every night on the local radio station replaying the show from the night before just before the new show comes on. i found the following article on a blog. the guest on cc peter lavenda was talking about some of this.artremind me who lavenda is. i may have met him in brussels and jerusalem. is he a chemical physicist?friday october the colour out of space i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw a yellowhairy fiveclawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. and when i stopped to reflect what the paw was it seemed to me thatit was egypt. hp lovecraftthis is only a testat on november regular television programming in southern england was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of grahama representative of the ashtar galactic command bearing the usual space brother boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a new age. it was quickly dismissed as a hoax but an extremely complicated one to execute. though the the sunday times the following december surmised it was accomplished by students using just £ worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery no one ever claimed responsibility and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneouslyand it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.this was actually the second message from grahama. a month earlier he had said pointedly that we conveyed to sir john whitmore and to dr. puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet earth. it is now in motion. we wish you to know that we love you.that grahama would single out the aristocratic former racing champion whitmore and parapsychologist and mkultra researcher andrija puharich suggests this was no simple hoax both men were deeply involved with a decadeslong channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the brotherhoods of the great white brotherhood. the entities governing our reality identified themselves the nine.another link to whitmore and puharich was british author stuart holyroyds recently published prelude to the landing on planet earth which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the nine. in the book holroyd wrote that the nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period th to nd november.”regarding the television interruptions lynn picknett and clive prince write in the stargate conspiracy that as usual there were only two options considered either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern english through their television sets or it was hoax just done for a idea that such a message could be easily contrived by for example an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has neverto our knowledge even been considered.of course there are several pages about me in that same book and i worked with puharich for a short while.this seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to whitmore and puharichand especially the latters service in army intelligence and later as a cia contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.whitmore incidentally is now also britains number one business coach training top executives from companies such as barclays lloyds pricewaterhouse coopers and rolls royce. uri gellerfor a time one of the nines channellers told picknett and prince that the cia brought puharich in to come and get me out of israel and in his essay in the thick of it physicist jack sarfatti writes that puharich was gellers case officer in america with money provided by sir john whitmore.andrija puharich and sir john whitmorethe deep space ninethe council of nine have been delivering curiously consistent messagesthrough a succession of mediums to influential patrons with names like dupont astor and bronfman since the early s and nearly always in the shadow of military intelligence. until his death in puharich made his homein that,0

16010,this is interesting cause i have several books saying the troops started to land only at evening of nd and that operation was completed by the early morning of rd. given that the order to go ahead was given on nd i would be quite surprised if finns landed there on st. however none of this matters. agreement quite clearly states that if the war came to baltic sea then finns were allowed to place troops to the island. and what do you know... nazi germany was at war and used baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the finns move troops there technically they could have kept troops there the whole time its not finnish problem if su cant understand treaty texts. also there is no requirement for the finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in åland. also as it happened soviet aircraft attacked unsuccessfully the ships headed to åland before they got there that is on nd of june. ,0
16011,i notice that tsbdy tried to revert the above paragraph beginning so lets see what weve got here just like tnxman tried to revert the prior text i dont suppose it has occurred to you that... by user ... . whats the explanation? the cabal is obviously trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article jim bell to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed. but thats not enough. they want to need to conceal evidence of their nefarious activites and that includes instantly if possible removing critical references to their misconduct even on the talkjim bell page. and all references to their misconduct will be critical the cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations other than to delete reverse erase or otherwise conceal them. it remains no violation of wp rules to post from an ip address particularly if the cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means. the cabal blocks people illegally so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the cabals finagling fingers. fortunately the identities of the cabal are now at least in part being exposed. skomorokh strangely is holding back perhaps fearful of losing control over his highpriority assignment. actually if skomorokh were honest and ethical he would by now either have weighed in on the subject or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute. rather than merely remaining silent. and since most of the incorrect misinformation on jim bell originated from skomorokhs edits he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected. ... ,0

16014, which page of the book a glossary of historical linguistics? that supports your personal opnion that most linguists reject altaic hypothesis which page of the book? i cant find it.it says....a hypothesis of distant genetic relationshiptaking its name from the altai mountains of centralasia it holds that turkic mongolian and tungusicmanchutungusic together comprising some fortylanguages are genetically related. more extendedversions of the altaic hypothesis would include koreanand japanese sometimes also ainu. various scholars inthe early and mid s proposed classifications thatwould group some or all of the ‘altaic’ languagestogether but typically these were included in larger morepoorly defined proposed affiliations such as the nowabandoned uralaltaic hypothesis.p.now abandoned is uralaltaic relation which was replaced with not altaic.eurasiatic greenberg’s hypothesis of adistant genetic relationship that would group indoeuropean uralic–yukaghir altaic korean–japanese–ainu nivkh chukotian and eskimo–aleut as membersof a very large ‘linguistic stock’. while there is considerableoverlap in the putative members of eurasiatic andnostratic there are also significant differences. eurasiatichas been sharply criticized and is largely rejected byspecialists georg and vovin . p. so wheres the phrase that supports your personal opnion that most lingusts reject altaic?,0

16032,ironically at this point the demoralised and disorganised british forces still outnumbered their opponents who had not even dared to pursue.this statement is somewhat false and a rather elaborate claim. in total there was french and indian troops against british and colonials. after the battle ended the french had suffered a mere casualties bringing their total strength down to . the british however suffered more casualties than the french had men they lost . so that brings the british strength down to . how does men outnumber ? should this statement be altered? ,0
16033,amen to that. the name of article implies a connection with the banking crisis. that link is spurious. american car manufacturers make an inferior product and are massively burdened with huge retiredworker costs and strong unions. as a result they have not been profitable and the recent petrol prices and now the funding crisis due to the banking crisis have brought them to the edge sooner than they would otherwise have got there. foreign car manufacturers are not in this position and do not have the same history and it is absolutely wrong to lump them into this article.,0
16034,i think i can help with some explanation here as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry quantum physics and engineering. the doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. the viewer is stationary yes but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties. this means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. one of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches and rise as it recedes from a viewer. the infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can in precise circumstances temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated and you can see the article slow light for more information. you are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not infinite infinite inertia. the infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. at the point that these conditions end the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic cage and reemmited. i hope that i have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant ,0

16059,your inability to admit facts in the face of overwhelming evidencewell if the shoe fits and the logic lacks then you are laughing at your own lack of logic in your previous and last contributions to the nwpl deletion page. you refuse to acknowledge overwhelming evidence. no sources say the nwpl was not responsible for having sparks recognized contrary to what you said. conclusion you are making things up. stop misleading yourself and wikipedia readers. if your research skills are not limited then your understanding of the facts or willingness to read what i have provided is. have you not read the study on park origins? what part of it dont you understand? if the nwpl was not responsible for the recognition of sparks then i challenge you honestly with facts to support your argument to demonstrate who was. below are two more articles to convince you of your egregious error dare i say fabulation? if you are not serving wikipedias purpose of informing the public then whose interest are you serving? i dare you to continue denying the facts. go ahead... i note that you and other editors of gatineau park material are aviation enthusiasts... sparks was founder of the park researcher says by dave rogers ottawa citizen may p. a mackenzie king is often credited with founding the park but an exjournalist says roderick percy sparks was the driving force dave rogers reports. the ncc has hired a pair of outaouais historians to study the origins of gatineau park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that william lyon mackenzie king was the father of the park. the evidence gathered by chelsea resident and senate speechwriter jeanpaul murray suggests roderick percy sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park. mr. sparks dedicated years of his life to the creation of a national park in the gatineau hills and for years was chairman of the federal woodlands preservation league a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of gatineau park. during the s mr. sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the gatineau hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the areas scenic beauty. the government created gatineau park in but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park. mr. sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in . the plan recommended that all private property in the area including his home be expropriated. mr. sparks vacant house on meech lake road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in two months after mr. murray the former managing editor of the federalist cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner. there was no electricity or combustible material other than the building itself to create a fire risk nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods. no cause for the fire was ever made public. the police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. there was no cause no suspects and no investigation. an obituary on mr. sparks in the ottawa journal of march called him the “father of the gatineau park” adding that as chairman of the federal woodlands preservation league he “brought about the first purchase by the dominion government of what is now the gatineau park.” born in where the supreme court of canada stands today percy sparks was the great grandnephew of ottawa pioneer nicholas sparks. he played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the kingbyng affair and to the subsequent defeat of the liberal government. mr. sparks contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the parks founder. “percy sparks was a giant who brought down mackenzie kings government in ” mr. murray said. he was the man who did more to create gatineau park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans. mr. murray said mr. king was cautious about the creation of the park. “i found an interesting passage in his diary from a few months before the park was created that showed he wasnt enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.” “the ncc says that he was one of the major architects of the park but this disproves it.” mr. murray said the ncc never mentioned mr. sparks role in creating the park so people wouldnt be tempted to advocate it,0
16060,posthumous adoption uh this means that he was adopted by caesar after his death...caesar died before augustus. its a bit hard to understand how caesar could take actions after his own death. and since caesar died before augustus it would appear that caesar did not adopt augustus after augustus death. this needs some clarification.,0
16061,conferences are a problem ive been meaning to work on. there are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references but there are many of great importance the situation is similar to journals. in practice tho we dont word it that way the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited as measured by the impact factor from journal citation reports. this can apply to conferences also. the difference is that for most conferences the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed therefore not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. there are two classes of exceptions ones where the papers are major review articles in the field and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication. im not sure about this one. ido not think it is one of these exceptions and i think the publications are mainly just abstracts as is common with many conferences. i would need to check i cannot do it this week. but personally i would include in wp articles about all journals used as references here and all major conference series however i doubt this would have consensus. the compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. that is probably the best thing to do here. the main thing i think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. this would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. talk ,0

16081, articles for creation/miriam battista hi arctic kangarooim totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article wikipedia talkarticles for creation/miriam battista. miriam battista is definitely worthy of notice – that is significant interesting or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded. its true that her moment of national fame was short but it was intense and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. also the fact that she received a news obit not paid for by the family in the new york times should in itself attest to her notability since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. for comparison please look at the article for gladys hulette. i certainly think that battista rises to at least the same level of notability.as far as verifiable references are concerned i truly thought i had overreferenced if anything there are references to charles donald foxs book famous film folk photoplay variety the new yorker the new york times the internet broadway database and internet movie database are these not considered reliable verifiable sources? if the problem is that i used too many references to privately held materials i apologize for that but i thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. i guess that raises a basic question for me would wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted even if it sheds light on the subject? if the answer is yes im afraid that wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.i had been considering trying to get in touch with wikipedia editors who are working on wikiproject biography as well as those involved in wikiproject film before submitting this article for review but as a newbie i wasnt sure how to do that. now that the article has been rejected i would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects as well as more feedback from you. perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.thanks in advance for any further light you can shed on your decision and for any help you can give me. ,0

16084,rankingsat the beginning of october substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the universitys recent performance and advertising. with a few tweaks this material has mostly been accepted on wikipedia. however the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. i reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussionin qs world university rankings ranked the university of canterbury th overall in the world making it the third highest ranked university in new zealand. its individual global subject rankings were th in arts humanities th in engineering it nd in natural sciences and nd in social sciences. in the university of canterbury slipped from th to th in these university loses ground. as the results were released the university of canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the vice chancellor dr rod carr claims that it ranks among the top % of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was uni in top %. further the university has promoted itself as being the first university in new zealand to have been granted five stars by qs stars a global university rating canterbury university gets top marks. unlike the qs world university rankings qs stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee the programme is designed to give ...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students to stand out and to be recognised for their qs stars.the second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence ie from in onwards. no reason has been given for this. i have suggested that this third sentence remain since it is purely factual and referenced but i am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. my proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. i welcome their explanations here and input from other parties.gadfium ,0

16131,hi there. let me make my comment a little more personal. the internet is full of sites like yours which you are definitely promoting by placing these links everywhere and access to them is so simple. wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a place to pop links in just because its the same topic. when the above message says to add content instead of links it is because external links are useless to a real encyclopedia. if possible we try to link internally and externally link only to resources for the articles. there are plenty of ronaldinho links and sites with videos that display his skills they should not be linked here. please please stop plugging your site under the guise of adding valuable encyclopedic content. you may very well mean well but this just isnt the place for this specific link. thank you for understanding. ,0

16199,editors here please stop telling others to stop discussing this subject. there was never a consensus to delete this article and there was only a very dubious consensus to merge which was never done the article was effectively deleted against consensus. several very sensible proposals for new names for this subject have been put forward which overcome the objection that an article entitled simple tau might mislead our readers into believing that there is any significant interest in the subject by serious mathematicians. one thing is for certain there is no clear consensus that we should have no kind if article on this subject in fact i am not sure that such a thing is even possible within the ethos of wp.one way to resolve this issue is to have a civil discussion on what would be a suitable title for the subject that has been discussed at length here i propose tau circle constant then start an article on the subject on that page and then start an afd. alternatively we could have yet another rfc on restoring the page under a different name.,0

16220,templateinfobox former monarchy hi thumperward. the reason i reverted your edit is because there are dozens of articles using the template which do not have a specific value for the coa width parameter based on the assumption that the default width was px. when you removed this default width value many templates suddenly found themselves with huge coats of arms which were visually striking and quite ugly. therefore i believe the default width of px should be kept. if you wish to remove it entirely then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. regards.,0

16229,i agree with you. i am a chinese contributor to this site and i speak chinese vernaculars and european languages and through some of the unreasonable mandarinization imposed here i feel how repressed nonnative mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. traditionally foreign names are transliterated into chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. in usa and europe it is mostly by the cantonese then subsequently the minnantaiwanese and recently the people for fuzhou wenzhou etc. as such they will use han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like english. there is no standardised version until the northerners came into power and imposed mandarin on all the other chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. i think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first i.e. the original followed by the oldest transliteration in chronology and finally the mandarin version. that will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. thank you for being so interested in chinese culture. we need more friends like you. have a nice day.,0

16239, july utcyes and no. yes because well its a technical decision made by the developers they change the config files at the direction of their bosses the userrights change. in theory it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. in practise look ive been an editor for + years now most of those as just an editor ive been contracted here for i think months and change. i know how silly a decision thatd be both for practical reasons people would get totally up in arms about it and for good reason and ethical ones we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can because were a bottomup organisation not a topdown one. so generally speaking i think editors should be able to disagree and i think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. thats what i believe and thats why i held that rfc.thats also why arguing with me is likely to be futile . not because this is a wmf decision not because this is my staff account but because we asked people what they want and they said give this to rollbackers too. i believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the communitys opinion on the subject and that its much more applicable than the rfc which was held when the community was in a much different state addressing an in some respects radically different question and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. so im not going to be persuaded by appeals to that and its not me you should be looking to persuade if you want the situation to change as said hold your own. if you dont want to do that im stuck in a situation hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. and im not going to do that. ,0

16252, thanks for taking the time to explain gbawden. i posted this response to tokyogirl and have also posted here for you. i would also like to request your assistance in gathering and presenting the materials for wikipedia entries as outlined below. i have no affiliation with the resonance project aside from nassim harameins lectures giving some validation to ideas i have been thinking about for a long time but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. at times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed. either way its flatearth society type behaviour that i find objectionable.i understand your points but disagree particularly on the notability aspect. i can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than the resonance project on wikipedia. i am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called community. instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it and by doing so silenced my opinions. thats wrong. and although a comment made by another editor stated that i had a chance to contest the speedy deletion i could find no such option.when you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas then you have a problem. wikipedia you have a problem and if i cant get entries for nassim haramein and the resonance project in i am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of wikipedia the notsofree encyclopedia. or really just add my voice to the growing dissent that is out there already. wake up wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world not another puppet.this new field of spiritual science or unified physics whatever you want to call it is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not. there are thriving social media communities of + individuals on both the resonance project and hassim harrameins facebook pages and yet wikipedia via its ignorant sorry its true editors quickly dismiss as not notable. its notable enough for people to include the information provided by nassim haramein and the resonance project in their social media feeds who are you to dismiss so many peoples opinions? people think about that.if i gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the wikipedia editorial drones?best regardsj,0

16344,the following was deleted from a discussion again rumination also known as omar amanat is being creative indeed about many aspects of trying to promote himself and deny facts of a family nature about himself including his religion that he may consider to get in the way of his ability to promote his business interests. when he claims that there is no reliable published source that states that he has two wives and this is slanderous if untrue he uses the phrase if untrue only because he knows he has had a wedding with sabiya amanat and a wedding with helena houdova while todate not having had a divorce from either of these two wives in any jurisdiction where the wedding ceremonies took place or where they reside. such deletions prevent the ability for discussions to occur and have nothing to do with personal attacks in as much as i have followed this too. if wikipedia articles are meant to be an accurate representation of the subjects then discussions need to be allowed for otherwise this will be just a soapbox for the likes of rumination.,0

16366, anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the limerick article they can add it in two seconds. merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. here it is a quick decision. go for it. dictionary it or delete it? merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge no more and no less. moreover you appear to have a broken sense of direction. the notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}. both articles discuss the city of limerick. we dont have duplicate articles about the same thing here. however the reason that i suggested the merge rather than outright did it is that clearly the claim that limerick is known as stab city for the reasons stated needs to be checked. the article like so many such articles doesnt cite any sources. with the notice other editors will come to the discussion and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say thats a load of old baloney limerick isnt known as stab city at all. and instead decide that rather than a merger an outright deletion of stab city for being unverifiable is called for. or on the other hand they may come up with some sources to cite. either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger. the merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. you could have posted a note on this talk page. limerick is known as stab city or used to be a few years ago anyway but it is derogatory. there are seperate articles for city nicknames see big apple. googling stab city limerick turns up sites including a us band. so stab city could be perhaps a disambig. it wasnt a stub needing work. it was and is a duplicate article plain and simple. both articles are about the city. ive pointed this out several times now. ive also pointed out that the parallel with big apple is a clearly false one. you havent explained why it is clearly false. the big apple is a nickname for new york and contains the history of the usage of that name. stab city is a nickname infrequently used to refer to limerick in a derogatory way. the stab city article has almost no content but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. i dont have the time or interest to do this. another example is big easy which redirects to new orleans or city of light which redirects to paris. if city of light was an article containing one sentence city of light usually refers to paris. would you put a merge note on paris too? if it were as superficially bogus as stab city was yes of course. this process is known as asking for the opinions of other editors. it is a useful tool in some circumstances. notice that it works. two editors have already given different opinions here and a third is forming an opinion. it is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. as you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus and that we are now having a discussion about it i have removed the merge notice. ive restored it. the notice is there not just to get your attention alone and i wrote as superficially bogus as stab city was. uncle g how would you like to progress with this dispute? uncle g has not replied for days. i have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice. the stab city article is inaccurate in any case the nickname dates back to well before the late s and first arose after an incident in which an argentinean tourist was stabbed. i think this was in the mid s. i havent edited the stab city article as im undecided as to whether its worth having. merge it now stab city is unfortunately associated with limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it but it certainly does not need a separate article. i agree merge it now. i cant see a realistic prospect for stab city to become a full article. i think theres a case for a crime in limerick article but not for one on this piece,0
16367, removal of images of nudes to editor ...... to be honest you raise a good point however it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them but also they will probably not see the nasty side that some adults might see. when i was a child i saw great beauty is such works of art. and i also saw great beauty in a van gogh or a rembrandt or any number of works by great artists. sculptures of david venus de milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world. and i might add they are some of the better parts of this world. since this is an article about truth i would ask you to honestly state your real concerns here. are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert? is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity? children as you may know have very short attention spans. they revel in one fascinating thing after another rarely staying with one thing for any length of time. in any case it is a violation of wikipedias neutral point of view policy as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one persons point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children. if these images are offensive to you then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article. there are several other articles related to truth that can be found in the navbars near the bottom of the article. best of everything to you and yours —  diss`cuss ^`.  ,0
16368,typing monkey you asked why sanchezs other accounts werent blocked. the reason is because wikipedias administrators have promoted and protected him. theyve permitted him to break all of their rules and to write his own biography. they will never enforce their rules with him. theyve removed documented evidence of his prostitution from the article and have greatly minimized his pornography career to the extent that nearly movies that sanchez filmed have been reduced to only six mentions.the more i look at wikipedia the more i am convinced that this site is little more than a promotional vehicle for whoever has a connection to one or two influential friends. the senior staff turns a blind eye most likely because they are looking for ways to eventually sell the whole thing for billions of dollars. someone better watch out because wikipedia is rotting from the inside out.,0

16374,i just tagged the ones you marked. however before we take this to a more public review i would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay. no point in wasting other editors time if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end. every image above said that it was taken from somewhere and thats generally not allowed. there are some specific exceptions but i dont see them applying. you should read the copyright faq specifically section . and . if you took something from somewhere and modified it it would count as a derivative work. the copyright for the original still applies in that case so it will not be allowed to remain here. as for using pictures created by your father i think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission i think there is a more formal way to register the permission but i wouldnt bother. you should know though that the license tag you selected public domain allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it. essentially youre releasing the copyright. thats good for wikipedia but if you think the picture is of great quality you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the gfdl licenses which are still accepted on wikipedia. if this is something you want to do ill be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs. in short it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work. even with a link back to the source you cant just take the image and use it here. there are some exceptions that can allow the use of nonfree materials such as fair use section in the faq but then it would require retagging and a detailed fair use rationale. it doesnt look like any of the remaining images cant conceivably be replaced by free alternatives and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles theyre used in. hence youll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.,0

16417, dear your point about nor and verifiable sources is well taken. accordingly i am providing an official government of india biography of ram mohan roy from the press information ministry of india which claims that roy studied judaism in addition to other religions. the url is . i do not know if you will recognise this because this same government for many years did not recognise the state country of israel. of course this only states that roy studied judaism and is not conclusive proof that brahmoism was influenced by judaism. however we find significant similarities between the brahmo dharma beej of and some tenets of judaism such as maimonides. you will appreciate that these issues are unproveable and matters of faith and i do not doubt yours. likewise i leave it up to you to do the right thing. brahmos are highly unlikely to claim that they are jews of any kind or distort / vandalise your religion/faith. my brahmo religion specifically prohibits reviling or disparaging other faiths whilst emphasising strengthening the bonds between men of different faiths. i personally have not known many jews judaists as there are so few in india i was lucky to have a learned tutor his name was ezra he had a phd and attended synagogue and i learnt many things from him besides mathematics. i respect your wishes to scrutinise all the other faiths which claim to have been influenced by judaism. sincerely. ,0

16465,qwyrxian you were quite objective in your point but may not be so in your point except us and uk nautical charts that you mentioned and oda mari provided the links in the npov side above. as saying international almanacs ... all without exception use senkaku islands this is wrong. the documentary year book with which i found that diaoyu islands but no senkaku islands was used by sg of the un in his official letter is an international almanac named international organizations and the law of the sea documentary yearbook of nilos documentary yearbook. it is for collection of related documents from the united nations system. therefore this is a very high if not the highest quality of year book or almanac. another un document a un general assembly document can be found in page of this year book which mentioned d and s as followssince the s china and japan have continued to dispute sovereignty over a group of five islets and barren rocks known in japan as senkaku and in china as diaoyu .... and for encyclopedias i checked britannica neither senkaku islands nor diaoyu islands can be found . when you asserted all encyclopedias all almanacs can you list all of them you checked? please dont do cherrypicking. dont assert too much more than what you actually did. bobthefish ever gave a search result on library of congress i rechecked it and am sure it is correctnote bobthefish has been topic banned for a year due to decorum issue but it does not mean that the objective contents he used before cannot be used by usso your point can be used by us to reach certain consensus. your point is biased and it asserted too much more than reality and objectivity. ,0

16478, criticisms of an innately modular mind many of the criticisms of ep have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately prespecified domainspecific informationprocessing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our pleistocene past. this section was intended to include criticisms of their massively or even mostlymassively assumptions with regard to modularity. however the rebuttals seem aimed not toward defending their position but toward attacking an entirely domaingeneral version of the mind. firstly this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the ep position and are thus not true rebuttals to these criticisms. secondly it creates a falsedichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics suggesting that the only other alternative to the ep definition of the mind is an entirely domaingeneral one. my suggestion is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals or to add a separate section beneath it titled criticisms of the domaingeneral model of mind. let us describe epers fighting their strawmen in a separate section. ,0

16497, background the background people keep reverting to in spite of all discussion is still absolute israeli bias. firstly the version you keep reverting to does not mention the fundamental background to the israelilebanese conflicts the existence of palestinian refugees. secondly the failed to control phrase in the first sentence has connotations far too negative towards lebanon and ignores the fact that lebanon has suffered far more greatly than israel from militancy within its borders. thirdly the background mentions that hizbollah continued to make attacks on israel after israeli withdrawal from most of lebanon attacks whose frequency have incidentally been greatly exaggerated yet it doesnt mention that israel also carried out incursions into lebanon during this period. once again i reiterate it is those who keep reverting who are not respecting the neutrality of this article and noone has has yet explained to me how i in any way am breaching wpnpov in this articleby the way yandman are you american? i only ask because a lot of americans are ignorant of the arab position in middleeast conflict and instictively proisraelieven when israel commits the most horrific war crimes they therefore often misconstrue otherwise lucid neutrality for promuslim bias. ,0

16513, context to fully understand the nature of limbaughs comments full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article. on the september radio broadcast of the rush limbaugh show limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the iraq war. the first caller mike in chicago who identified himself as a republican and former service member told limbaugh i do believe that we should pull out of iraq. limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively. after that call limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to retort to mike in chicago the original caller. this second caller who identified himself as a soldier complained that the media never talked to real soldiers like himself. he was clearly responding directly to the first caller who had told limbaugh he felt the iraq war was a mistake. the current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller. it doesnt make it clear that the second callers remarks are in response to mike in chicagos antiwar comments. this second caller never mentioned jesse macbeth at all. with the addition of the first conversation the new york times response that limbaughs phony soldiers comment was referring to iraq war veterans critical of the war makes sense. as is this article is heavily skewed in favor of limbaugh. both sides of the controversy need to be presented. right now this article is simply a limbaughfanatics wet dream. ,0

16517,== some main mechanisms for transitional justice in burma ==by aung thihawhat is transitional justice? before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future burma we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. it is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. the most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. therefore we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. it is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. we have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. it is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. for instance u kyi maung who is one of the members of the national league of democracy nld used to answer the question made by journalists saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in germany th august and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. it was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. as a result it can lead to internecine circumstances. in relation to the transitional justice in burma we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. first in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when where and how they happen. the investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. there can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. we can also get tangible information from the government files mass graves and testimonies. for instance we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies who they were how and when they were executed. it will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. we also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. second regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in germany. actually what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. if we prosecute them the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of burma’s political progress. as a consequence the civilians will be victims again. furthermore prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in burma. it is not realistic. on the other hand if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. they will not be satisfied with us in power and we will lack credibility. in some cases we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they at the same time are both perpetrators and victims e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the spdc. it is not always possible to regard them as criminals. therefore both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. it is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term. third in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. as i already mentioned by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. then they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. by not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. fourth reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. for instance in germany the government compens,0

16550,brutal korea apology sorry ive figured out now what happened. i was working from a hardcopy that id printed out a few days earlier without realising that the two refs had in the meantime been changed by someone for some strange reason by joining two the refs together. in short my hardcopy was different from your onscreen version. hence we were literally not on the same page. i can see now that one has to check for the very latest online version of anything before jumping to false conclusions. learning curve.,0

16560, ayers hes never been convicted has he? x as far as i know no. pretty sure of that. why? hes never been prosecuted never been convicted. calling him a terrorist is or as well. x i mean its a blp issue. theres no proof to it. x where is he called a terrorist? we just closed an wprfc with consensus against doing so so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up. there is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate. he admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. ayers is a terrorist. you certainly have a right to that opinion. on wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one. incidentaly the weathermen is not certified as anything nor does ayers agree that he is a terrorist. there is considerable reason why we dont do that here. but thats moot. thats gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final. you are wrong. i know it is hard to admit when one is wrong but you should try. the weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the fbi if that isnt a certified then i dont know what is. if someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. i mean you might as well argue that paul mccartney isnt a singer unless he is declared as such. you must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that noroton posted at the rfc calling ayers a terrorist. and you must have missed the point. according to the legal system ayers has never committed a violent act. x put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now. gentlemen perhaps you can have a debate over whether ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page there are a million pages on wikipedia three million really and i dont really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue. on wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him. there are probably a hundred thousand blog pages message boards etc. where you can call him a terrorist to your hearts content. wow you are a flaming liberal arent you? so let me get this straight...in your opinion someone who builds bombs for use against the u.s. government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist. let us all hope you arent in a position of leadership in real life. simply appalling really. ... no what dont you fucking get? nobody is saying ayers isnt a terrorist. just that per wikipedia policies he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. x and the organization which he helped found was classified by the fbi as a terrorist organization. what more do you want? shall we repeal the th amendment and waterboard im a terrorist out of him? ,0

16565, headline text questions and commentsms. barber wrote in a united effort the issr licensed breeders only produce approximately pups per year ms. barberhow many of those puppies were produced by your kennel? what specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?you and those supporting your club/registry have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests while appearing rude insulting superiorminded and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you founded and the other breeders affiliated with your registry. i certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do as i cant imagine anyone with any intelligence and selfesteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.you claim a lot but you provide no independent support for your claims only your own writings on your own website. you claim anyone producing dogs other than you or your registry are frauds yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos you have taken of these dogs and your own rantings as evidence. you claim breeders unaffiliated with you are in it for the money yet you ignore the fact thatyou produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined through your wholly and coowned breeding dogs. your website for this winter alone shows you are producing eleven litters at new zion and through coownership breedings. eleven litters even conservatively speaking could easily produce over puppies and you are planning for more litters next spring and summer you also currently list over stud dogs and over females you are considering for breedingyou charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce $$+and you contractually reserve the right at your own discretion to substitute a puppy from a buyers desired litter to another compatible again based on your own determination litter after the buyer has submitted payment to you. see zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirementsyou require your puppybuyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time of purchase but you also require them to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. you have no stated policy on your website page re your own commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you produce should they become unwanted homeless and/or end up in shelters or abusive situations.your policies and prices make no mention of a contractual requirement or even a suggestion by you with the signed contractual commitment of your puppybuyers to spay/neuter their new pets in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs in general. i could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the u.s. million + including % of which are purebred dogs is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion. your website does not list any references such as recommending/governing affiliations i.e. better business bureau approval ratings i.e. ofa pennhip cerf or other professional organizations to which you belong ie. american dog owners association the the delta society therapy dog training or agility organizations etc. only your own dog clubssdca you own dog registry issr your own literature except some very limited information by dr. padgett and numerous and righteous religious and biblical quotations.you are the chairman of the board of directors for your registrys dog club the ssdca which charges for membership and participation in club activities. there is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override any challenges to your decisions.you control the issr dog registry which charges puppy owners/breeders numerous fees for numerous types of registration papers and other background information not to mention also deciding if/when/where/how any breeders in your registry are allowed to breed their dogs. there is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override,0

16577,wikipediaexternal links and blanket reverting in my edit summaries i clearly explained the removal of each of those links. your mass rollback of those edits without comment is very impolite and violates wikipediaexternal links. please read that page to understand why those links are inappropriate an external link added to an article should provide information specifically about that articles subject. per wikipediaexternal links one should avoid links to sites that are only indirectly related to the articles subject the link should be directly related to the subject of the article. a general site that has information about a variety of subjects should usually not be linked to from an article on a more specific subject.this is why for example we do not link to in every movie article only the subpage of about that movie. cf. templateimdb name.inclusion of such links into a template might be very desirable for the sites owner to maximise the seo/page rank benefit but please note that wikipediaexternal links explicitly discourages links mainly intended to promote a website please do not insert such links again and do not make blanket reverts without addressing the arguments that other editors gave for their edits. regards,0

16598, i found three other sources that use the term. two provide minor coverage though one is about a specific language malbolge while one provides significant coverage of the topic just a brief oneline usage of the term to describe malbolge malbolge is known as one of the most esoteric programming languages. in this paper we prove that malbolge is weakly turing complete. just a brief oneline usage of the term in the references citing this article the following url has some links to the different esoteric programming languages discusses the topic at length. largely verbatim excerpts from a conference paper coauthored by mateas. favors the term weird language but says esoteric is more commonly used. i think mateas and cox are enough to establish notability of the subject. as far as i can tell the term as its used here was invented by editor ... in this article in and expanded in scope later that day by editor ... the definition has been stable since then. the term may have been taken out of context from an earlier website called esoteric topics in computer programming that site used esoteric programming languages as a section name about a much broader set of languages seeming to use esoteric as an adjective like unusual rather than as part of a specific term. none of this is from a reliable source its original research and not suitable for inclusion in the article but it may be useful for others trying to find information on the subject. ,0

16605,how do they pick up the words? you cant use words you dont know. granted its very hard nowadays to be sheltered from swearing and cursing but im relieved that in my curiosity i found that the percentage of those with ts who exhibited this is considerably less than half. because the way the media and others have stigmatized this it makes it sound like people pick up swear words even if theyve never heard them and thats not possible language must be learned. that brings me to my question which i think should be part of the topic. how do those with this pick up the words and why do they automatically use taboo words? like say for instance i know someone with ts who has never heard . he hears it i act shocked and so he figures its taboo. does the part of his mind that says not to say it then turn off or what? further what about someone growing up in an environment where the words are not taboo like some inner cities where every nd word is ? does this person then not say the taboo word becasue where theyve grown up they havent learned it is taboo? all things i was curious about when i looked up this article and probably all things that are far too complex for anyone to include in the article. but i thought id ask.,0

16609,the topic of mutual intelligibility in slavic languages is a bit difficult. for example bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the slavic type and very difficult to understand for most slavs. in czech there even exists a saying speaking like a bulgarian for unintelligible speech. yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar the nonexistence of wordendings the use of articles. you can listen to a bulgarian not to understand a word and doubt if you are actually listening to an indoeuropean language and then you see a bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. so the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. as for the difference between czech/slovak and polish i must agree with the polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation if you try to be patient. so a limited intelligibility would be a more correct term. as for written polish czechs and slovaks shouldnt have any difficulties with a general understanding polish text although quite a few words especially of technical sort may seem obscure and untintelligible. however the closest slavic language to czech after slovak is lusitan sorbian especially upper sorbian. i dont have any personal experience with this language but from the written texts i saw i think that its resemblance to czech can be compared to east slovakian dialects which means that you can understand some passages easily but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words. ,0

16652, response to gnangarra and a suggestion for a compromise introductionthanks gnangarra for your comments. everyone interprets policies differently and this talk page is no exception to that. there are two policies widely debated here which are wpblp and wpundue. i am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page i did not include opinions from blp notice board and individual members talk pages. if i may have made mistakes unintentional in the summarisation please feel free to remind me and i will correct. now while gnangarra pete skyring suturz and yeti hunter think it is wpblp violation mickmacnee merbabu orderinchaos peter ballard chaser lester matilda and carbon rodney dont. gnagarra and orderinchaos believe it violates wpundue mickmacnee matilda and carbon rodney dont.quote from wpblpmy interpretationthe reason why gnangarra thinks it violates blp is because of the availability of only one reliable source. as far as i understand reliable sources in plural do not mean that it needs more than one reliable source. even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by gnangarra we have more than one instance when howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page including the head of a state. please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. due to these reasons i personally think that this does not violate blp as with many others.clarify you are taking my comments out of context you ask specifically what policies was i quoting for opposing the text. it was the lack of multiple independent sources ie one reliable source the abc article though still questionable as its lacking specific details. in this blp is clear poorly source contentious material should be removed. garra quote from wpundue and my interpretationi guess the first quote deals with two different views. an example can be that one view being that the world is round and one being world is flat. in our current dispute i am not sure what we are comparing. are we comparing reports that he was alleged of war crimes and not alleged of war crimes if such reports exists which contradict the abc news reports or are we comparing that he was alleged of war crimes and he never commited war crimes. it is hard to make the distinction here.the second quote says that minority view should not be represented at all except in articles devoted to those views. the content in dispute may fail inclusion as per wpundue because the belief that he commited war crimes are held by a small n,0

16675,wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a dictionary so it has articles about topics not entries about words or expressions. this article is trying to cover an expression with unclear meaning not a topic. thats the fundamental problem.specifically to your diff i agree with the removal of these links. the first is not appropriate here because criticism of atheism is relevant to this article only because it is relevant to atheism and atheism is relevant to this article. the second link target is perhaps slightly more relevant but still not relevant enough to justify such a prominent link from an overall topic to a tv documentary.perhaps you understand the problem better if you think about see also links to psychology of religion and religion explained. i guess you wouldnt be too happy about them. they would be just about as relevant as the other two which means that they should also not be there. adler ,0

16679,i am sorry to have hurt your religious beliefs. seriously are you asking me to find sources when you have none? are you aware that wikipedia is not a democracy? refer to wppoll. i do not see the consensus. i agree with the oldest surviving monotheistic religion part but i completely disagree with the claim of judaism being the oldest surviving religion for two reasons there is no scholarly source making this claim apart from some anonymous jewish? child who has uploaded some pdf file on a website that has zero credibility. are you serious? i still am shocked to see that you guys are defending an anonymous kids high school homework paper as a legitimate source of knowledge to be honorably quoted on the wikipedia. credible sources like encyclopaedia britannica are saying that another religion is the oldest surviving religion. on the wikipedia article on hinduism the exact same claim is made but with reliable sources see wpsourcesamong its direct roots is the historical vedic religion of iron age india and as such hinduism is often called the oldest living religiond. s. sarma kenneth w. morgan the religion of the hindus or the oldest living major religion in the the world. so my question is which page on the wikipedia is to be trusted in this regard? the one with reliable scholarly sources or the one with anonymous selfpublished pdf files? i still do not understand why the name of the authors are not given and they are considered scholarly sources. where were these cited works published? where are the references in the works? these essays are saying god made a pact with abraham... and so forth. how can this be even taken seriously if the article is assuming that all the god pact story is actual historical fact? any way thats the besides the main point. the real issues here are reliable sources selfpublished sources verifiability and original research by anonymous teenage prodigal scholars.now let us examine the scholar noel from texas who wrote this high school homework paper. on the cited source the said scholar claims to be at the time of writing this scholarly article. do we still need to talk about wpv in this regard? the other cited source a music website run by jewish people does not even have a title or name of the author or date of publication or anything except the bold claim that judaism is the oldest religion.please do not take this personally or anything i really wish to stress this twice i just like to see wikipedia as a reliable encyclopedia. is it more about reflecting personal sentiments or providing credible knowledge cited with scholarly sources?in summary i say that the uncited claim of judaism being the oldest surviving religion be removed while keeping the oldest monotheistic religion part and keep wikipedia a serious unbiased encyclopedia. hope i have appealed to your better judgement.... ,0

16693,regular disclaimer on vandal userrovoam dear fellow wikipediansthis ip is just one of a whole army of anon ips used by a wellknown vandal userrovoam who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of wikipedia as the most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in wikipedia so far.this person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous azerbaijan and turkeyrelated entries such as nagornokarabakh caucasian albania artsakh arran azerbaijan urartu azerbaijan azerbaijan disambiguation turkey kuraaraxes culture nakhichevan safavids karabakh khojaly khojaly massacre stepanakert khankendi ganja city baku demographics of azerbaijan .az history of azerbaijan azerbaijani language azeri caucasus history of turkey oghuz turks ottoman empire turks ottoman turks turkic languages turkic peoples mannaeans list of azerbaijanis and even templateeurope removing azerbaijan and turkey from the list.he also vandalized user pages and talkpages including usertabib usertony sidaways user page and talkpages user talkrdsmith user talkcryptoderk talkpages userweyes userdante alighieri userchanting fox.since the person uses wide range of ips it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. in the past hes been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new ip. thats why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages some of them more than once.rovoam started his actions in wikipedia from introducing nationalistic pov edits in nagornokarabakh yet back in february . his aggressive discussion behaviour unilateral unagreed changes to the entry and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors with myself being his major opponent. the conflict was formally decided after arbitration committee placed him under oneyear revert limitation and personal attack parole . however this decision made rovoam even more radical and obsessive as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt wikipedia perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me ?for exposing him and proving him wrong?... this person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. he is not the usual sort of vandal but is rather knowledgeable in what hes dealing with. he could have been very valuable for wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. his edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. as i have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to usertony sidaway usercodex sinaiticus userisomorphic userwho userdbachmann the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.some external links on the issue my post on rovoam in wpani may rovoam and vandalism in wpani users discussion on how to deal with this vandal my report on rovoams vandalisms in wpvip may talkurartu as well as numerous posts in talknagornokarabakh talkcaucasian albania etc. jun utc,0

16734, dear resid i am sorry you disagree with my actions. i did not prevent you from being able to edit your talk page in any way your block allowed you to edit your talk page and i did not protect the page please verify this from the logs of my protections for yourself and indeed i cannot see any evidence that another admin did so. i have not deleted any page you created to date i am afraid i am not aware of the report on vandalism page you are referring to. you can likewise inspect the log of my deletion actions to confirm that i have not deleted any pages that you created. as for editing after discussing i agree but there is no rule that states all edits must be discussed first on the talk page and indeed although i would agree on such a course of action where multiple users disagreed with a particular change it seems clear in this case it was merely you disapproved of any changes being made to the wikiethics page whatsoever. although blanking pages is indeed vandalism the removal of text in the manner of editorial modification is certainly not vandalism. you cannot simply revert changes you dislike i am afraid wikipedia does not work like that. please take this as a lesson as i will be forced to block you again if you continue such behaviour and considering that many other admins apart from myself have blocked you on numerous occasions eventually you may find yourself indefinitely banned by community decision. i would sincerely hope an intelligent individual such as yourself would modify your behaviour to prevent such a course of action being necessary. regards talk ,0

16784, as i promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that i am very familiar with ... i.e. oil refineries petrochemical plants natural gas processing plants extracting natural gas liquids known as ngls and other hydrocarbon processing industries. those industries probably have perhaps % or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation but i am not familiar with those industries.major industrial distillation types the two primary types of industrial distillations are continuous fractionation or continuous distillation and batch distillation. the industrial continuous fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large vertical cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the fractional distillation article. please note that by continuous i mean hours a day for to years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about centimeters to meters and heights ranging from about meters to meters or more.there are many subsets of the continuous fractionation primary distillation type such as fractional distillation vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation extractive distillation steam distillationthe above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary continuous fractionation towers. the vacuum towers require reinforcement provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. as for the vaporliquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers it is virtually impossible to explain bubblecap or valve trays or sheet steel structural packing without drawings or photographs. we need someone who could make such drawings. we also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettletype reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a distillation tower although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces horizontal or vertical heat exchangers bayonet heat exchangers etc..finally if you look at the the simple sketch that i made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the fractional distillation article that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream entry at about the center height of the tower and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. ,0

16787,elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well but i only put it out there for discussion. argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable. these diagrams are metaphors far from exact ones of the imaginary field yet appear in the article. imaginary numbers are not yet points. keith devlin wrote since the complex numbers are not points on a line you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger for the complex numbers there is no such notion. yet he also stated there is however a notion of size of sorts. the absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number. devlin keith the language of mathematics making the invisible visible macmillan .} desmond fearnleysander explains that from a geometric point of viuew complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors. fearnleysander desmond plane euclidean reasoning in automated deduction in geometry nd international workshop ed. gao x et. al beijing china google ebook theyre the clock hand that points to the hour not the hour point. consistent with this logic its better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself. this sidesteps the variability of complex number position its the planes fault if you will. want this grounded in mathematical foundations? look no further than the riemann hypothesis.riemann extended eulers zeta function which euler developed to find prime numbers to define complex numbers. riemanns wanted to prove eulers conjecture which he attacked by solving complex solutions to fzeta = . riemann found x + iy where x lies between and has infinitely many solutions. he proposed they all except negative even integers are of form / + iy. computer tests find the first . billion fz = called zs solutions lie on the line x = / in the complex plane. but inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything and the riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.the only singularity of zs is the simple pole at s or . there is no reason to assume complex numbers are points. i dont believe this is nonstandard. it is profound and documented.brian coyle,0

16812,email to sean black i did not want this text to be publicly known since i still have to contact the professors but in the current situation i see no choice but to put the draft text here. pm . i earlier emailed this draft to rob speer and joe hall for comment and just sent it out to sean black. pm . i noticed that i am also blocked from the rfc page. i have not had much time to investigate what the intention of that page is since i am writing my email to the professors so i dont know whether that page or being blocked from it is important.pm . it is not true that i only editted pages on myself.pm . who hold that contacting a professor would be the same as contacting an employer neglect my earlier comment that i approach the issue from the angle of the integrity of science. the proper reaction is not to neglect it but give the argument why this angle would be improper. pm . on the rfc joe hall suggests that my objective would be to punish him or so. no i only suggest that the professor and he discuss the situation from the angle of the integrity of science. earlier i wrote that this would be very beneficial for him. pm . joe mentioned that hal varian no longer is the dean at sims. thus the draft needs at least one change.pm . i told everyone that i wanted a time out. why dont you respect that wish ? didnt i read somewhere that a truce was also an option ? dear mr. blacki saw that while i was composing my letter to the professors at mit and sims further action on wikipedia about me. there is an rfc which i am not familiar with and now you seem to have been blocking me whatever that is. below you find the draft text of my letter to the professors. if you think that this is threatening and not befitting a scientific community please reply.a few hours ago i already sent this draft text to rob speer and joe hall. with an introductory text that i no longer have since wikimail has no cc. but they might forward the email sent to them.i would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what i can expect.please see also my recent edit of arrows impossibility theorenm.my regardsthomas colignatusdraftto the president of mitprofessor susan hockfieldhockfieldto the dean of sims university of california at berkeleyprofessor hal varianhalmarch dear professors hockfield and variandear hali have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students rob speer at mit who started the problem and joseph lorenzo hall at sims who is interfering in an unhelpful way. the problem is summarized in the appendix.obviously the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. with students they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can and they are only learning the trade. yet students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. when issues of integrity arise it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. in this case these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.in the present case the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet in particular wikipedia. it appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. my reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.it is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. my impression is that this relation exists. firstly they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of mit and sims thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there implying their relation to you. secondly they are active in editing work where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. this is most clearly so with joseph lorenzo hall who is already a ph.d. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. for rob speer who started the problem it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose. in the end it is with,0

16847,rajput is the term or caste introduced much later in the indian caste system. everyone knows about that and their origin created by brahmins from agni chandra and what not because in medieval india they were the rulers and it was the hour of need for brahmins to bring them into varna system for protection and other reason where as saini or shoor sainis are ancient tribe and are yaduvanshi kshatryas. so remove the part that sainis claim to be rajputs. sainis are yaduvanshis. when yadu vansh started there was no such caste as rajput. read the puranas and other history sources. so there is no such thing as sainis claiming to be rajputs. sainis are yaduvanshis and there is no such thing that sainis claim to be yaduvanshi it is a fact that sainis are yaduvanshis. sainis were warriors. also in sikhism sainis played a very important role in the areas of anandpur sahib and chamkaur sahib fought for guru gobind singh ji. in holy text guru garanth sahib ji saini caste is mentioned as the true friends or sajjan or mitar. so sitush stop creating your own stories. whosoever has problem with sainis as rajputs please do me a favor and remove the claim to be rajput part becuase saini is an ancient caste and are yaduvanshi kshatrya long before rajputs were taken into kshatriya fold.,0

16879,clayc thats not a list of evolutionary biologists who dispute evolution nor of ones who dispute it for scientific as opposed to religious reasons according to the website you provided its a list of creationists holding doctorates in science. are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of evolution because creationists arent banned from getting doctorates? thats rather silly indeed.creationism is a personal religious belief it has nothing to do with science. there is no scientific evidence for creationism and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peerreviewed scientific paper. the problem here isnt that youre trying to dispute evolution by linking to a christian website after all christians can do science too rather its that youre trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than mormonism or hinduism or trinitarianism does. it is scientifically and biologically unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons and creationism is a religious movement based on the book of genesis in the bible not on scientific observations. if you think that the book of genesis or any religious movement based on it is science you gravely misunderstand the meaning of science.also thats an amazingly short list considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. and how many people on that list are actually biologists?also a criticisms section is a bad idea though a related article is currently under construction objections to evolution. when its finished it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered. its not a scientific topic however but a social and historical one so it will have little mention in the toplevel article evolution. ,0

16899,let me refresh your memory.pjacobi delete one persons theory not in any way in contact with academic reserach. pjacobi my response who cares how many people wrote it or whether it is in contact with academic reserach? if you want to read about things that are in contact with academic reserach you should subscribe to academic journals. wikipedia is not an appendage of academia and the ctmu nowhere relies on contact with academic reserach to make its points. please lets keep our eyes on the ball here. asmodeus now please read carefully.. most theories are written by one person others are free to utilize them or not in their own work later on down the line as they choose. that others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the ctmu was published. this is not necessarily a reflection on the theory it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working which inasmuch as we are after all talking about philosophy may ultimately lead nowhere. indeed it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. you have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds and that was wrong of you as a wikipedia editor.this leads us to. it makes no difference whether a theory is notable to academic researchers whether or not this is the case. it has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. again citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a wikipedia editor.you have voted to delete an informative wellverified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. in so doing you have let wikipedia and its readership down. please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future. ,0

16942,now that im unblocked i can post my reply to you.you are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago in an apparent effort to censor me and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.immediately after challenging me this last time you had me blocked so that i could not respond. one wonders what you are afraid of. you appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with from ever seeing the light of day on wikipedia. as reported on cnn and abc last month these tactics are why wikipedia has been attacked so much lately and why its being taken less and less seriously as time goes on. such behavior is slowly turning wikipeidia into a bit of a joke and has helped diminish its once significant potential for good.your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper got up early the morning it was to be delivered and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors papers in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that mornings paper.interestingly rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. if you dont like what people with whom you do not agree try to post rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation you try to shoot the messenger.for example in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers you attack me by implying that my screen name allabout means i sell poppers.you are wrong.you also imply that i am associated with again you are wrong. however i happen to agree with those who say that the all about poppers site contains a great deal of credible information supported with solid evidence. ive spent a great deal of time reading the site and digging into the information presented there. i know of other similarly credible popper sites as well. would you say i am associated with them too?as the record clearly shows over the past few weeks you and others some of whom may be one in the same perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge. that is wrong and you know it. i note that today you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the sites history page. this history showed the summary comments for various edits. it now appears youve allowed it back in.you say just tell me if this is all wrong and misleading........i have not said this is all wrong and misleading. there is information on this page which is accurate and theres information on this page which is not accurate. but when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. the record is very clear in that regard. again as anyone can see you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on jan you ask me why did you use this disclaimer. i wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. are you homophobic? opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with? antidrug crusaders? feel obliged to fight sin and pleasure wherever you find it perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? or simply just believe that if you give people information no matter how accurate it may be that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe that people will flock to them and that somehow the end of the world will appear? much as in reefer madness?the disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears. unlik,0

16980,dear mr manjunath i was mearely trying to point out to mr pompus whoever he is that other dravidian speakers especially kannada speakers have had their great empires too and that tamils are not the only empire builders.precisely you were trying to trumpet kannada achievements at the cost of that article which had a totally different angle. your modifications made the article completely absurd. your narrow minded hatred against tamils has only succeeded in vandalizing the article.secondly kannada speakers did not start their litreary traditions very late. they started their traditions later. please correct your english and see the difference in wording.thank you for the correction. probably that was the only change you had to make and you succeeded in totally distorting the article.this was because they were ruled by prakrit speakers in the north and hence kannnada did not get the official recognition as early as tamil. this again has to do with geographical proximity. please be aware of this. just because the satahahanas encouraged prakrit does not mean kannada speakers did not speak kannada they just had to abide by officialdom given to prakrit thats all just like tulu spearkers todays have to abide by kannada being the official language.totally irrelevent to the topic at hand. anyway the studies on dravidian languages is still ongoing process. if the present studies are correct the regions of andhra and karnataka spoke dravidian language earlier than the region of tamil nadu. probably that makes protokannada older than prototamil. but that does not deny the fact that south india was referred as dravida and not karnata. the article was a mere compliation of the records that talked about dravida and its association with south india.i dont see this issue out of place. just as mention of early tamils kingdoms is valid so is the mention of kannada kigndoms to show that speakers of other dravidian languages have had their time in the sun too. get off your high tamil horse.this was the same reason i said you have not understood the content of the article. it was neither a propaganda to project tamils nor to denigrate kannadigas. its just a mere exposition how dravida represented whole of south and that included gujarat and maharashtra where the only dravidian influence was that of kannada kingdoms in the later period.i speak kannada with my mother. therefore i consider myself a kannadiga. thanks for your personal attacks. makes me proud of my kannadaness. jul ,0

17024,as wpoi saysoriginal images created by a wikipedian are not considered original research so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments the core reason behind the nor policy.the published information which is the basis for the annotation i.e. the three letters/arrows is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map and also in a footnote to the maps caption i.e.macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast the location and circumstances of the accident and the location of gages lodgings and harlows home and surgery..thoughts on this? as with the image links ive put the map back so we and others can see what were talking about. a proving a negativethis regards a recent edit to the passage macmillans comprehensive survey of accounts of gage scientific and popular found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes...which removed the word comprehensive.this is a delicate point and i want to come up with something everyone can live with. i think there are two questions here.first was macmillans analysis indeed comprehensive? no one whos been participating have any doubt on that but just in case open the collapse list.first rate example of carefully done historical work psychological reports obstinately searched all possible sources. it seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered cortex fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend lancet even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information... neurosurgery quarterly the definitive account. one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary. science macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding gage is concerned this must be a definitive work. history of the human sciences macmillan has shown that the record of how phineas gage’s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution... new england journal of medicine second do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? imo i think we do because it the analysis assserts a negative which requires extraordinary research just saying macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. two examples from the collapse box macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. it seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered the definitive account. one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary.without such a clear statement we get edit summaries such as this one .actually theres a third question do we need to include a quotation such as the further research is not necessary above supporting the comprehensiveness? i dont think the reader needs that. i had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness in other words the quotation was there for editors not readers and this discussion can take its place.so what i suggest is that the article say macmillans comprehensive analysis of accounts of gage... where cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness but without quoting them. what do you think? ,0

17063,i am writing you because you have been disrupting wikipedia for the past week. im not sure if you even understand how your edits are disruptive so ill try to explain. wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. this means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views. your edits seem to be pushing a christian pov by removing certain articles from categoryjesus while adding others to categorygod. i think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with jesus than in categoryjesus? there is no reason to remove article just because they come from a muslim or jw or jewish point of view. normally if you make an edit and someone else reverts it that means there is no consensus for your edit and therefore you shouldnt make it again. excessively readding controversial content is considered edit warring and you can be blocked for this see wprr. what you need to do in these situations is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles that isnt how wikipedia works. ill also note that because of our npov policy i see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category jesus. if you want to know more about wikipedia or if you want to discuss your changes feel free to ask me or request help from another user. thanks. talk,0

17078,no it only allows a single person to remove someones new edit successfully using the revert rule. a new edit is not a revert and if what you say is true it does give new editors a handicap because as i said it allows a single person to win over the person adding something new. on the other hand if a new edit is not counted as a revert which it isnt anyway then it would take two or more people to cancel out a new edit which would make it truly concensus. if new edits are counted as a revert then i dont see wikipedia going much further then it already has. that is why articles stay the same size and never change. i have seen this for the last three years. the articles only become like figuritive cute little wicker baskets that sometimes have little bits and peieces removes and shoveled around and worded little way different but never change and stay the same little cute backet that it always was. not never informative. ... ,0

17092,dear neil. the first summary is extremely helpful as it summarises the difficulty in accurately translating the term the entry is about. it could be described as sarcastic. the second summary is very sarcastic but still entirely appropriate to the edit questioning several extremely dubious statements made in a context where potential libel is an issue. the third uses the word fuck but is nonetheless helpful as it replies to the question in the previous edit summary regarding a difficult to track down formatting bug. i am prepared to acknowledge that the fourth edit summary represents an inappropriate venting of my feeling about people who use obscure words they do not understand in the place of simple words that they do.,0

17111, drug abuse before i attempt to do a major revision on this article i would like to get your opinion on the title. i notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article? it seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction. what do you think? if you disagree in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go and what topics do you think it should focus upon? i was thinking it could examine the scientific poltical and social aspects. viriditasi believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article which is a redirection to recreational drug use. it could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted npov term and having appropriate redirects.i agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article but then such an article substance abuse should also include information on alcohol abuse which currently has its own page as alcoholism.the drug addiction page has some pov problems. what should be done here is to leave drug addiction itself under the domain of addiction and rename the drug addiction page with all its references to brain chemistry and method of action to drug dependence. anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page.im more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper npov naming even if they are stub articles as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages.my vote would be to make substance abuse its own page talking about substance abuse in general and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances i.e. alcoholism. specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages. im certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages.im certain that some will be opposed to separating the good and the bad of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages consider alcohol > alcoholic beverage > alcoholism but if alcohol is treated that way then other substances deserve the same consideration.if people disagree then id argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined. apr utc,0

17135, unfortunately jafafa hots appears to be ignorant of the facts and engages in pettyminded cynicism feel free to do so as it is the preserve of the fool who cannot deal in rational debate. there are political connotations to using the term british isles when describing the republic of ireland we find it offensive the law provides for it to be called the british irish isles in light of the establishment of our free state in and independence in . so such political connotations exist in calling people of the u.s.a. americans the term exists because every other country in the americas have their own identifiable description and you outlined some of those this left the u.s.a. citizens to be dubbed americans and it is not politically offensive nor is it legally incorrect. you go on to say by labelling us irishmen you mislabel no such word swot up on your english half of us. the million population of the republic of ireland overwhelmingly consider themselves irish and of the . million in northern ireland consider themselves irish leaving roughly to consider themselves british. now the last time i indulged in mathematics did not strike me as half of million so come back to me when you have a little better grasp of the situation and stop making ignorant and idiotic comments on an issue that you have little or no real understanding of. go back to important stuff like contributing to articles on college ice hockey thats where i would suggest you belong my good man. go make a difference. ,0

17175,ccd affecting other insects?==while all this is certainly entertaining the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse mankind will not disappear. wild pollinator insects animals and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches. at this point its not clear yet that ccd only affects bees. it certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder. also the quote may be overly simplified. but the big picture is that without pollinators things are much more difficult. i have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. if you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. wild bees are generally becoming rare in the western world due to habitat destruction. this is afaik most severe in c europe. i agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse. little if anything? the proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with ccd. even in the event that ccd should prove to be a disease diseases are rather specific in what they affect and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects and there are only species of honey bees. its like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals such as humans. that is an unreasonable expectation it most definitely does not stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder the reality is exactly the opposite. the seven species in the genus apis have had something on the order of million years of independent evolution million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects compare that to the million years mammals have existed. the human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. but no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?while it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects bees foremost among them ccd even in a worstcase scenario is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture. ==,0

17178,personal experience since there isnt much to this article or stub i thought i would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut. i use it occasionally for insomnia. in my opinion it is not a long term solution for insomnia. tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use. i have never had a problem with withdrawal but i have heard that is possible but not life threatening just uncomfortable.phenibut does has a long halflife so usage should be spaced out. i would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions then a minimum of two days off. one use a week would be preferable.it does work well for insomnia and tends to produce vivid dreams which is interesting but its usage should be carefully monitored.when used as directed i have heard of no major side effects. it will increase the potency of sedatives so that must be kept in mind.this is just my own personal experience hopefully more people will add to the discussion.,0

17193,i and i alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. i was foolish to think id get a meeting with the president or the nobel peace prize. i guess i had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when i did it. since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. you have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that i intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. are you going to be a part of that? why do i say this? because if i dont stand no honest person will forever thereafter. have wikipedia editors blocked william r. buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks one short one and hes back at it... or blocked stevebaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? no. or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew i did nothing for political bias? did wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker freitas and merkle from this place no wikipedias rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and wikipedia knowingly lets them. this is a media rag period. like any other. there are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. further again if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a boston tea party. get it? its called self defense something you clearly do not understand. the only rule is a fair one and i dont see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. if you did we would not be here. i have not once been treated fairly and i dont see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. you speak of rules then block those that wrongly attacked me first before i even had a chance to play fair. before i stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. dont walk away when i am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all dont drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do mr. media guy. if you treat me fairly you would be the first from larry king to don and mike to the chief of police in prince william county virginia who had me arrested five times knowing i was innocent saying i was crazy for just talking about a selfreplicator even with my patent in my hand gold seal and all and you wont write of that here not fairly. you want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now but you wont. but most of all punish those who start the transgressions not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. and do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.i have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor to answer you that question. do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because i am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me that is all. i dont like wikipedia because the rules are unfair herewoirse than any other media operation ive known.charles michael collins,0

17195,please note that i never called him or any other editor a liar ever. before the last ani i had commented about wees clear misrepresentation of facts as lies about times these are all presented at that ani. after that i toned it down to misrepresent of facts/comments or untrue statements simply because there is no other way of calling it. have you looked at the diffs presented in that ani by wee and me? can you point to any specific one where i have failed to present evidence or the evidence presented was insufficient as to back my claims of him misrepresenting my comments? as ive said other editors agreed that if an editor makes it a habit to engage in such disruptive behaviour it is not a personal attack to mention it. how would you react to an editor purposely and repeatedly misrepresenting your comments in a discussion? do you not agree that such behaviour should be brought to the attention of that editor?it would appear as if you looked at the former ani and took wees word for granted about me casually calling him a liar. let me repeat myself i have not theres a big difference between calling an editor a liar and pointing out that he is simply lying for which i have provided evidence absolutely every time.you say im in the wrong for stating that wee made untrue statements and apparently believe ive not presented evidence for such. how can i defend myself if you dont tell me a specific occasion where i did so? every time i commented on his misrepresentation of facts i have provided evidence for it. how else could i appeal this block if you dont comment specifically on my supposed violations of wpnpa? regards. ,0

17314,for time being let us leave the puppet business aside it is a totally different issue i am suggesting to jimbo privately.back to the important one i can understand your problem which is weather we should include objectionable or controversial issues on wikipedia. but who are we editors to decide that? as long as the information is supported with facts and verifiable resources there shouldnt be any issues and no one can logically object. our job is to give adequate representation to factual data weather somebody likes it or not dose not matter.finally i am really not pressing for goa history on any article. but what is wrong has to be objected and corrected with facts and verifiable resources objectionable or not that is what i believe in. there cannot be a compromise when it comes to information i dont like the idea,0

17326,hi proudbolsahye. sorry for the delay in reply. no problem about patton it happens. in regards to maghakians infobox the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person containing only key information succinctly. the ribbon icons in my opinion detract from the information serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be. i know you pointed out the case of the john shalikashvili article but i think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out which should not have to be the case it should be presented just there. the article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed as you have done in maghakian but not too much information placed in the infobox. as for the service medals as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received and not service medals. maghakian is notable for his awards of the navy cross silver star bronze star and purple heart the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox. if he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here. i think you would be better off expanding the awards section of the article and keeping the infobox succinct. cheers,0

17343,hey there i saw your recent comment on the yom kippur war talk page here and i too share your concern and frustration over the endless reverts by the pov pushers such as this one by romac. i have had issues with him in the past in connection with other articles. i have yet to see him add relevant content or make one productive edit. i have only observed him engage in endless reverts of sourced material. in any event we need to build consensus. currently you and i as well as and favor israeli military victory in the infobox. sherif johnz and romac oppose. the rest seem to be on the sidelines though i believe that and seem to be leaning on our side. in fact hohum actually reverted sherif here and restored my sourced edit concerning idf victory. i think that it is imperative that all edits be sourced. it is also imperative to effectuate substantive edits within the article itself so that the changes reflect and correlate to the result section of the infobox. in any event dont dispair and dont give up. youve made some excellent edits thus far. i encourage you to continue. best regards ,0

17345,heres an addition to the rationale. let me know if this is sufficientto identify early work by the creator profiled in the encyclopedic article. to identify cartoon collection of the creator profiled in the encyclopedic article. the image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary. it makes a significant contribution to the users understanding of the article which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. the image serves as a visual identification of the artists cartoon work. it illustrates an educational article about the artist showing his style and technique. most importantly it is a selfportrait and as such it reveals silversteins selfimage. the silverstein travelogue pages had a unique sketchpad format which is not seen here but could be added if necessary.,0

17352,below i am pasting an email from a historian whom i asked about the correct title. talk the truth is that the english language really has no equivalent to freiherr the title of the ruler or freiherrschaft the title of the political entity because neither or them existed in the englishspeaking world. the loose translations sometimes given baron barony are inaccurate in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction. medieval english barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of durham and a few other historical exotica.the concept wasnt limited to silesia. it existed throughout the holy roman empire and within the hereditary domains of the habsburgs such as bohemia after .it is normally preferable to keep the german term italicized and give a sentence or so of explanation.,0

17362,whatever you do do not leave me a message. est april i keep finding pages that have been deleted. i just added a {unreferenced} tag to a wiki deletion policy page. im sure im not the first person to think of this. what degree of crap will be flung can only be imagined. i undid your edit to ignore all rules as it was not in the spirit of wikipedia. see wikipediado not disrupt wikipedia to illustrate a point.that should be wikipediawhat ignore all rules means. please sign your entries by typing four tildes. have you read wikipediaplease do not bite the newcomers yet? except when you violate the rules about creating articles you said except when you violate the rules about creating articles in which case the page in violation will be quickly deleted leaving no trace of what occurred. even the conversation about it may be deleted forever. this comment like everything else on this page does not cite sources. this comment may also be in violation of some rule.thats an interesting point. several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already. will you be helping out with that? > hi kim. i dont know what looking into even means in regards to wikipedia. i dont know who people are who does what or who created the rules. i dont know what helping out means in regards to your question.my first effort here at creating an entry was put up for deletion in minutes then deleted without discussion by some admin. now i cant find the brief discussion about that. but it led to the realization that many many pages here the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia dont cite sources. the pages dont list authors either. they are nebulous pages that dont follow the rules those pages insist i follow.interesting? damn right it is interesting. ive read a lot of criticism of wiki and defended wikipedia for years. but now well i see a huge flaw in the system. replythe only links i saw in the article the one on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seemed to work fine now. were there other ones you were thinking of? i answered on your talk page. cornfused i tell you heh heh is usernakon some kind of bot? i have no idea what happens on wikipedia sometimes. while reading the als entry due to a friend having been diagnosed with it i followed a link to the als association which gave me that page that says there is no article. i looked it up on google and created a short starter page on it. right after i hit create i realized there was already an entry but it was under als association so i hit edit this page to make it a redirect. it came up as deleted in a matter of seconds some asswipe called nakon had deleted the page.deletion log . . nakon deleted the als association csd a corp article about a company that doesnt assert significanceconsidering there already was a page and it certainly is significant the ultrafast deletion is an example of some kind of fucked up mentality. this idiot has to be using some kind of software to scan every new article and s/he must have spent seconds before hitting some sort of deletion key.unbelievable. this level of bullshit goes beyond anything i have ever encountered on the internet before. if i had changed the entry to a redirect i would have missed the event.i use wikipedia all the time but i spend almost no time editing or creating pages. most of the changes i have made over the years have been fixing minor mistakes or reverting vandalism. having managed to avoid ever being drawn into the,0

17368,apparently the part where i dont take any side in this matter is lost on you. i am not endorsing the current version as better. indeed if i did revert it myself it would imply that you are somehow right because i took a positive action to put the article in your preferred state. i am taking no action. see wikipediaprotection policy where it says when protecting a page because of a content dispute administrators normally protect the current version. i am under no obligation to put your version of the article up any more than i am to put his up. if this is unsatisfactory for you then seek outside opinion at wpdr. if lots of other people who have never worked on the article before agree with you after that process the article can be changed... . ,0

17387,i think that may have just been a typo or an overzealous californian writing the annual report. wnyws own site lists them as foxs flagship as do dozens of other sites. there has long been the concept of west coast flagships though which are generally if not entirely the la stations. in any case it may be sort of a moot issue. i mean come on were talking about the wb and upn here. they could pick a station in new mexico as the cw flagship and it wouldnt really mean anything. theyre all still operated as independent stations that just happen to carry a couple of hours of programming off the satellite in the prime time. what does it really mean to be the flagship of a real network anyway other than that it was either first on the air or located in the same place as corporate hq or both? ,0

17392,so you find that a rightwing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct. there has been considerable study of marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources. the only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians. also they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors time. we have an unsubstantiated claim by jenny marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons. we do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in belgium in . reliable sources state that the french government supplied unemployed belgian workers with weapons in paris and these workers then returned to belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government. we know that marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country but in fact the accusation was false. the types of additional sources that martintg has provided are unreliable. boris nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist writing in not a mainstream historian. wheen and muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream. we just do not know what marx did with the francs he received.,0

17427,you have not cited any sources proving the image is not of godane. all you have done is cited sources using a different image of what looks like the same individual taken at a different angle at a higher resolution with eyewear. what so you are saying that you are right and the united states state department pus the plethora of international media agencies are wrong. well thats just convenient for your pov. uhh sorry wikipedia doesnt work like that. your sources are so weak. you state that he wears women clothes as if this somehow disqualifies the image depicting him. the source credits this piece of groundbreaking intelligence on a somali warlord yusuf mohammed siad. your mention of this is pointless and doesnt help your argument whether its true or not. your second source is also worthless. you take the words of a blog over a the united states state department and some of the most well known media agencies in the world with the deepest connections anywhere in the world through their sources and correspondents... that article was posted in january before any of the major international media agencies had broadcasted that image of godane and even if it was also used prior the words of a blog dont hold any water whatsofkingever compared to the sources already cited against you. let me be clear you havent proved your position with these sources. the position to use this image has been proved with the above sources and many many others . is this enough? i can keep citing more if you want. if you doubt the images authenticity then i suggest you write a nice little email to the rewards for justice email info and ask them. but as far are the facts go the image shows godane and the onus is on you to investigate this for yourself by asking the u.s state department if you doubt them. i find it hard to believe you have been editing wikipedia for years becuase youre an absolute joke. your whack pov is ruining this article and preventing a permissible image from being added. the image will continue to remain and be used in the article until you can provide information from reputable and worldclass sources. continue to remove it and i will be pinging an admin on the issue.,0

17478,im happy to believe that the name blackbeard is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. the issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of blackbeard for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. simply stating that blackbeard is mentioned in a modernday film/book/comic/play doesnt tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. i suspect before we include the fact that blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. i also doubt that the reallife blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of potc> more likely and with all respect to ian mcshane it is likely blackbeard will simply be a large blackbearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says yarr. an entertaining figure no doubt but not one that advances this article which is about the reallife caribbean pirate.i dont mean this to sound snarky so my apologies if it comes across that way. its just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. check out the page history from about a year ago to see what i mean. id prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions even when blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/tv episode. instead and for what its worth i support parrots suggestion of mentioning it at the films article where it has apropriate context.views comments welcome. ,0

17487,your recent edits to the mediation cabal page first off i thank you for you line of communication in the matter. my reasons for editing is that i never sanctioned that my name be inclued in any part of any medation nor did i agree to be inclued as a part of any medation process. the inclusion of my name only with out the inclusion of other is only to distort that he their are other in the dipute yet i am only one that has not allowed this user to or one of a few that has not allowed this user to get away with his pov war that he has instagated to force a merge of articles and to distort the truth and misrespresent the facts that have not only been presented to him but to all useres. unfortanially as is the case with vast majortiy of internal processes here i find them infeffective slow and somethimes corupt and i have very little faith in the internal workings of this system. i will consult on the infromation present but on in a private matter but in the end i can only see this working as an appeasment which will not be acceptable under the current cirmstances. trácht ar,0

17491,i agree that youre being very cautious and i think caution is right as i noted. however i think in the case of the buav images in particular that they are clearly fairly used. you have to ignore their provenance to think otherwise. i can see from your discussion with her that slim was not very successful in communicating her point of view because she interpreted legitimate concern over copyright for a personal attack largely because i think you didnt take into account the source of the photos and their likely reaction to their being in wp. still i do agree that she should ask for confirmation from buav that they are cool with our using the photos but i think you should lay off them and her so long as she has made the commitment to acquire that confirmation. this message copied to slims talkpage for her notice. ,0

17522,warning you deleted in the larry craig article the documented mention of the press coverage of the rogers outing the following three times within the last hours. the section appears to comply with wpblp as it lists mainstream media coverage of the accusation and denial rather than the unconfirmed claim itself. further reverts may result in a block. the section has been called by other names so if that is your only objection you could discuss changing to the earlier name of the section or removing the section name since yeaterday the info was just included under the “personal” section rather than unconfirmed rumor. please improve the article by negotiating npov wording in the talk section rather than by serial reverting. if the material violates wpblp or is libelous so that the rr does not apply then reverts made to enforce this provision are generally not considered contentious. however it can be easy to confuse removing potentially libellous material with an edit war over neutrality issues which are contentious edits. err on the side of caution do not repeatedly remove material you consider defamatory unless it is blatant and seek intervention from others early at biographies of living persons/noticeboard.revision as of october edittbeatty talk contribs wpblp deleted improperly added unverified rumorsrevision as of october edittbeatty talk contribs →unconfirmed rumors blp no place in wikipeida for unconfirmed rumorsrevision as of october edittbeatty talk contribs →unconfirmed rumors does anybody really think a section called unconfirmed rumors belongs in a blp or anywhere else in wikipedia? ,0

17615,this logic is convoluted and general nonsense. the arbitration decision involved a disagreement about content in the khojaly tragedy article. it did not involve a statement i had not yet made during the nonactionable enforcement request. therefore i did not violate the arbitration decision. the wording on my talk page clearly states that i violated the arbitration decision where you said the following to enforce an arbitration decision. you were not enforcing anything via the block but rather making a unilateral decision to disregard evidence i pointed to and block me for accusatory language. i hope that makes my concern clearer. ,0

17636, coup not revolution first off i removed the reference to after yanukovich fled the country. the term fled is loaded and pov. to say he left the country is nonpov... but the statement added zero value in the first place. second lets talk about some english language usage for all the ukrainians on here specifically the difference between literal and figurative languagerevolution a fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.coup the sudden and illegal seizure of a government usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body civil or military.let me explain the difference clearly. a revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures. this clearly did not occur. a coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures. this clearly did occur.there was no revolution in ukraine. there was only a coup. this position is nonpov and sustainable. i recommend maidan coup or ukrainian coup... but the term ukrainian revolution is both pov and misleading.note above i use the literal definition of revolution to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures e.g. the american revolution. revolution also has a figurative definition of wideranging change e.g. the industrial revolution. applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily pov. for example neither the velvet revolution nor the orange revolution were literal revolutions and their names are pov and misleading. in both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents. i recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and having become widely recognized are appropriate titles in wikipedia. that does not change the fact that they are pov. nor does it change the fact that in this case there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such pov naming. i reiterate that the appropriate title is maidan coup or ukrainian coup ... ,0

17644,ec not apocryphal. time magazine stalin was man of the year in its jan issue is rs and fairly contemporaneous to the event. the undesirable classes anecdote comes via novelist gore vidal and is quite likely inaccurate. the version from lady astor otherwise conforms to the time version. as does modern times the world from the twenties to the nineties by paul johnson. as does russias iron age by william henry chamberlin. three reliable sources for the story. and apparently g. b. shaw said that astor was the only person in the world who could be bossy with stalin making the story quite believable. gbs view is quite horrifying indeed. in russia on the other hand extermination was carried out on a scientific and humane basis. well worth having that in the article as well. ,0

17658,my worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. on wikisource you dont have as much history so there are less people watching you. it would be a much more pressured environment for you. can you remain calm in these circumstances? my perspective on wikipedia is much different now. i have enjoyed immensely wikisource where granted the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging so my editing energies can safely go there. i have made close to edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors. i dont intend to get involved in the award culture on wikipedia such fac far or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards. my first interest is fixing up articles that i would like to link to wikisource articles but are in such bad condition that i dont link. secondly i would create articles that are needed for explanations for wikisource articles. i will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor where an editor lists and article under articles i wrote or refers to my articles in posts. i will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. outside the fac/far arena there is not much of a problem i dont think if any at all. i have created over articles in a multitude of subjects mostly to fill in missing links on wikipedia. i will continue with low key endeavors such as that. however at the sign of any push back i will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor or even editing wikipedia for a while. also my misery was generated by a small group of editors. i am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an arcom settlement. — talk ... there are certain people i intend to avoid at all costs i hope they will do me the great favor of avoiding me as well. who are these other people? unless you name names how can they know to avoid you? what if they choose not to avoid you? how will you react then? fatuorum as a followup to malleuss question i did not ask for or to follow me to venezuela articles nor did bishonen ask for at least two accounts to follow her so how will staying away from fac and far help certain people avoid you? talk ,0

17667, possible issue one weird question. the old rumor about the last line of eoe came out as true and in a rather disturbing interview. the line was supposed to be id never want to be killed by you of all men absolutely not but was changed to disgusting after a question from anno. the situation as commented by miyamura voice of asuka is at last anno asked me miyamura just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. he can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesnt. instead he masturbates looking at you when you wake up and know what he did to you. what do you think you would say? i had been thinking he was a strange man but at that moment i felt disgusting. so i told him that i thought disgusting. and then he sighed and said ... thought as much. he said. i thought as much. original text mirror archived now heres the situation. this actually is a very simple analysis one which i am sure even wikipedia would allow but it is of a bit questionable nature. in end of evangelion shinji sees asuka in the hospital ends up revealing her body and masturbates to her. asuka who returns after the third impact questionable prior death notwithstanding makes the comment disgusting when she is laying beside shinji. would simply stating the information as presented be acceptable for the meaning of asukas final line the meaning is so obvious that it is not a synth. ,0

17686,this comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test. the author writes but we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create. of course i and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only some few things the problem is that mike serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants. we do not want society where most people are only allowed to know some few things. we want a very narrow and specific limitation no cheat sheets questions and answers to tests that are used to help people. other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better is that clear enough? we do not advocate that only psychologists know psychology as falsely claimed only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked. its as simple and limited as that. leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the sat or some other test would make articles on those subjects encyclopedic. a democratic sense of equality brought about by leaking psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams why shouldnt everybody be able to practice medicine? lets leak all the questions ans answers... etc. when you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose to examine how well students have learned history. a history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him on the contrary. he just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and its much harder for this to be done if he cant use a test to do it. similarly when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. this makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified. the purpose of the rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. mr. serfas statement that is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful is absolutely false. there is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by james wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even wood the rorschachs main opponent states that the test is not worthless see this article. this controversy can be adequately described and ought to be in the article without including the tests cheat sheet its questions and answers. even wood states that the rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. thus by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder a tool for doing so has ben compromised. people might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given or conversely not be treated for something they have. most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the rorschach in the article. it would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests etc. they object to including information about the test. just not the tests questions and answers. so no psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. theyre just people defending a test used to help people which like most tests gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. its rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position. i hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.some people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the dark ages by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. i invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side? there was a time when common sense indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. the science backed up by thousands of studies is clear that the rorschach works but common sense tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. or that some kind of magic is involved scientists were once accused of witchcraft.,0

17731, i dont get your point. could you please elaborate? are you referring to the verses of hindu scriptures that i added? if so then id like to inform you that the subject of the article is implicitly about the massive animal sacrifice done in the name of hinduism. the article doesnt focus on anything else. i didnt only cite the scriptures but also other sources that purports to tell what is the real story behind the origin of gadhimai festival i didnt claim it as the sole truth either but it provided a food for thought. if according to you that is original research then everything is original research wont you say? if not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to hinduism as a religion of nonviolence? the article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to hinduism. isnt that a sufficient ground to shed light on the religions actual position. besides the animal killings of the festival are associated to hinduism but based on what? isnt that an original research or a subject of personal opinion too? thank you i await your reply. talk? ,0

17744,its already in the policy first bullet and is common practice for literary templates i have created a ton of these but also have seen other people creating them as well. the redlinks link to clearly notable topics that deserve articles and have considerable scholarship thus they are likely to be created. redlinking in general is a good think and encourages continued article creation. this has happened with the jfcooper articles and i am sure it will happen with the trollope articles. moreover a redlink is a useful navigational tool in that it shows people where we cannot help them yet. if you dont remember years ago one of the biggest growth tools to encourage new editors was read links read wikipediared link. but precisely this kind of overreach on policy to make wikipedia look complete and not a wpwork in progress prevents new people from finding ways to contribute and discourages people from making good faith attempts at contributing. please dont let this kind of legalism perpetuate the decline in editorship,0

17761, august utcit is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks though there are some who disagree with that. if when you remove a personal attack you are reverted then do not remove it again. instead seek an outside party to investigate preferably on some sort of public noticeboard. i really do not know the first thing about the ireland dispute and from what little i have heard i dont want to touch it with a foot poll.no there are not different standards for different editors. there is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system and those who do not grasp the intricate details. while wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. knowing the correct form noticeboard or procedure will take you far knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther. it is a bit of a shame that such an advantage is given to those who know the ins and outs but it is the way things end up working here. chillum ,0
17762,when prodding just a friendly reminder to use an edit summary when proposing deletion for an article. edit summary usage is always good but it is especially important that edit summaries are used when proposing deletion. the reason for this is that articles proposed for deletion that later have the tag removed should not be proposed for deletion again but rather sent to wikipediaarticles for deletion. the only easy way to check if an article was previously proposed for deletion is to look at the edit history and the edit summaries people have left before. thanks the article in question was bijon b sarma the edit summary read nn. cheers t,0

17766,please stop being a miserable delete artist i note that almost all of your edits are to destroy somebody elses well meant contributions. certainly we need to keep rubbish of the wikipedia but we do not need self appointed self righteous policemen picking at details. that behaviour poisonous wikipedia. it is hard to encourage new editors to contribute when you just beat them up over pedantic nonsense.in my case you attacked a noncontroversial contribution to an article because of references. not because you disagreed with it or even understood it. just because of the legalistic issue of references. and the article does actually read a bit like a company sales promotion but you would not have noticed that more serious issue.well ill tell you a dirty little secret about wikipedia. lots of good contributions do not have references. particularly about maths science and technology. but just because some well meaning editor does not go to the extra effort cite does not make it original research. if there is controversy then certainly references are essential and need to be good ones. but most of the world is not controversial.just look at your user contribution history. what a miserable tale it tells.so if you must edit wikipedia please try to contribute positively rather than just focusing on picking on other peoples generous contributions.,0

17789,am i sure about what? being a sockpuppet? by wikipedias own definition i am not. i will defer to you about dreadstar personality however in this case he has been out of line. he has been trigger happy. he neither tried to understand the reason for my edits nor attempted discussion. he simply immediately fired off a final warning. i tried to discuss this with him on these pages and rather than join in he just blocked me. and as for resetting modems well you are entitled to your opinion about what doesnt sound right but what i do not think sounds right no make that what is not right is an admin who so quickly blocks editors reverts legitimate edits and does not engage in discussion. admins should remember that wikipedia is nothing without volunteers. these people contribute their knowledge and all free of charge if they are treated as i have recently been the result will be they will not contribute and consequently wikipedia dies. is it any wonder that wikipedia is held in such low regard in academic circles?,0
17790,i agree with some things you say but ive seen them yes you base them on some historical reference but they are very negative for example its obvious why youre attached to stepankert and other armenian related articles armenians have inhabited those lands for thousands of years whether it was under russian turkish roman byzantine rule. also using udis as puppets against armenians doesnt seem right or caucasus albanians for example ive read some azeri scholars about what they wrote. anyway we wont find a solution to this the edit wars would not resume we should at least give both sides a piece of the pie. ,0

17837,wow that discussion is way beyond stupid. nothing but media hype? what the hell is that based on? the wikipedia page on the shooting is over words long and the article on the trial is well over . how can that be if those internet randoms are correct in their dismissal of this as something of little encyclopedica value? and retrolord you dont know what youre talking about. i live in the uk and ive been getting daily updates on this controversy on the national bbc news. thankfully i was able to find the articles without them being on the main page but no thanks to you apparently. it is unbelievable to me that wikipedia can be so ignorant in how it chooses what is and is not important enough to display on the front page.,0
17838,it depends whether we want wikipedia to be cuttingedge. it is clear to anyone studying time cube that dr rays discovery of the ineffable corner truth renders him worthy of the positions of greatest thinker and wisest human he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. the only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of time cube.well i myself am not so keen on dumbing down wikipedia for the stupid and closedminded people although some people do seem to be as evidenced by the censorship of the following materialin late and in the midst of a prolific period of time cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational cubic scriptures dr ray took the cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level by solving the major philosophical question why something rather than nothing? the answer as published by him on his time cube website related to the principle of opposites in this case static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites an important element of cubic geometry between the opposites all things are created. as an entity they exist only as a big zero seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.it appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for why something rather than nothing? so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. thus when the solution is revealed they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the cubic truth which as we know disproves god and exposes religion as an evil wordscam. it seems a pity but in reality great things dont come easy. we must all fight to break the wordshackles of religious and academicinduced corner ignorance and force teachers to teach cubicism above evil cubelessness. humanitys sole hope of salvation lies with corner cubic knowledge.,0
17839, cluttering royalty articles in the article line of succession to the romanian throne you added middle names unsupported additional surnames and whatnot to the names in list of family members of king michael. i empathize with your desire to embellish and decorate but still in my view such details are clutter in an article where they are just small parts of one list. could you kindly refrain in the futire from cluttering articles please. by the way are you not aware that the invented additional surname de laufenborg is commonly laughed at probably as that soninlaws fantasy ideas of his promotion to nobility and king michael has not used it as part of his granddaughters name as far as can be detected from sources of that article. ,0

17896,if you are familiar with mis the churchs membership database youll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. however if their parents are still members their names are kept in mis not as members but part of a family who has a member with the parents until they are . nonbaptized spouses are also included. if i remember the designations for these are child of record unbaptized and nonmember +. they used to have an unaccountable designation as well for those with disabilities who dont need to be baptized although ive not seen it recently no unaccountables in my last ward that im aware of and theyd also be included with child of record in my opinion. church statistics are more accurate than most other denominations estimates and the computer system designates and distinguishes quite easily. the catholic church for example bases theirs on country statistics if a country is deemed catholic then + percent is counted as being catholic even if they are not or if they have had their names removed. see this recent thread and resulting discussion. ,0

17940,hi thanks for email. i deleted your article because it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. sources that are not acceptable include those linked to the company social media and other sites that can be selfedited blogs websites of unknown or nonreliable provenance and sites that are just reporting what the company claims or interviewing its management. your references where all linked to the company no independent sources. the claim that would make it notable the number of downloads has no independent verification.it was written in a promotional tone. articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. the list of features is entirely unsurced and makes unsubstantiated claims like this is one of the most used features in apus launcher... according to apus it can intelligently push useful information like weather traffic etc. to users.your edits indicate that you have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. thank you for declaring your interest. if after reading the information about notability linked above you still believe that your organisation is notable enough for a wikipedia article and that there is significant coverage in reliable independent secondary sources you could if you wish post a request at wikipediarequested articles for the article to be created. see also wikipediabest practices for editors with conflicts of interest. the nature of your edits also gives the impression you have a financial stake in promoting a topic. paid advocacy is a category of conflict of interest coi editing that involves being compensated by a person group company or organization to use wikipedia to promote their interests. paid advocacy is prohibited by our policies on neutral point of view and what wikipedia is not and is an especially egregious type of coi the wikimedia foundation regards it as a black hat advocates are very strongly discouraged from direct article editing and should instead propose changes on the talk page of the article in question if an article exists and if it does not from attempting to write an article at all. at best any proposed article creation should be submitted through the articles for creation process rather than if you are receiving or expect to receive compensation for your edits you are required by the wikimedia terms of use to disclose your employer client and affiliation. you can post such a mandatory disclosure to your user page at user. the template can be used for this purpose – e.g. in the form {{paiduser=employer=insertnameclient=insertname}}. if i am mistaken – you are not being directly or indirectly compensated for your edits – please state that in response to this message. if you are being compensated please provide the required disclosure. in either case please do not edit further until you answer this message. its not the worse ive seen and if you want to try again with proper references ill post the deleted text to a user subpage for you to work on just let me know. you must reply to the query above first though. talk to me? ,0

17946,greetings hi cirt i hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. if you have any qualms with particular edits id love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. id like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. the first is from jimmy wales== you can edit this page ==really you can if you would like to please feel free to do so. make an edit – or even several after all that is what wikipedia is all about.and the second is from neelixs user pagewikipedia is thoroughly inherently collaborative. in the humanities division of academia we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. in the sciences and social sciences we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. on wikipedia every welldeveloped article has many more than three authors. the result is an everincreasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. this objectivity is not the pseudoobjectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. we write better when we write together.i think those principles are pretty neat. and i am certain my editing adheres to them. if youd like to contact me off the site let me know id be happy to share ways to get in touch.,0

17956,it appears to be okay now. i wonder why this keeps occurring. — wikipedia links turn red on occation on wikiversity as well. its like the database splits. main page layout helloim sure this has been asked before but i cant find the information anywhere. can someone direct me to an article on how to remove the title from the article? for example on my wiki the main page always says main page on top and i would like to remove it. thanks in advance.also if you can also point me to where i can change the article tab on top to main page that would be great too. thanks again.i dont know much about this but perhaps its the skin you are using. go to my preferenses then skin and select monobook. unfortunately you can only do this if you log in or create an account. talk this is a technical question about the mediawiki software best asked on wikipediavillage pump technical. its not difficult to do this but it would require code changes. i believe this is done in mediawiki with the following lines of codevar mptitle = main pagevar ismainpage = == mptitlevar isdiff = = if ismainpage isdiff { lastmod sitesub contentsub { display none important } //correct me if wrong but i think all you have to do is add these lines to this would be good to add to the main page faq. talk contribs thanks for all your help. with your input i was able to google search for the very answer to my solution here. basically its like you guys said edit the username page or mediawiki if you want to change it for the entire site just search for that page and append the extra code. my apologies if this posting is located in the wrong area i simply could not find any other spot to leave this message. thanks again. september suggestioni think that adding a link to the sandbox in a prominent place not in the small print will help new users to find a right place to experiment and not carry out trial edits on actual pages. my hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category. any support for my theory? firstly i think its a good thing that random tests can occur in main space. it rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone. the only way for some people to believe this is to try it. secondly even after the header redesign for this page with the red flashing lights many people still dont notice it. but even after my disparigment im not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent where do you suggest? i suggest with the overview · searching · editing · questions · help part the one under the welcome to wikipedia box. with a brief explanation of what its for in brackets so new users know what its for and dont get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of wikipedia. at the moment at x pixel resolution there is no room for any more links in that area. ok...how about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the main page? that way the sandbox is accessible anywhere without having to know what to type into the search field or having to go back to the main page which might achieve my aim better since its less troublesome to go to the sandbox. b,0

17997, if a photo shows that the post office is itself labelled united states post office on its exterior then i would concede would generally agree it could be renamed to that unless there is more weight of sources calling it something different. pubdog and/or bd could you separate off those into one requested move discussion using the multimove requested move option? maybe some other concern here can be addressed simply. specifically i dont see any problem with there being double redirects for existing articles. if theres a redirect to an existing individual post office article and the article is moved that does indeed set up a double redirect a redirect to a redirect to the article. but bots come by and fix those automatically within a day or so. nothing needs to be done this is not an issue to worry about. if a name change is agreed to then just moving the article suffices. and then because of dab style rules the name shown in the dab page could/should be updated to show the actual article name. the county nrhp listarticle need not be changed it can still show the nrhpofficial name and reach the article by a redirect perhaps temporarily by a double redirect but a bot will make it a single redirect very soon. pubdog does that address your concern? more complicated are cases where there is no article and the topic is listed as a redlink in this dab page plus in a nrhp county/city/state listarticle plus possibly also in a local town article. then to implement a change requires finding and changing all of those to point directly to the new preferred name. you cant set up a redirect to a nonexistant article it will be deleted promptly. in these cases i would prefer for a stub nrhp article to be created immediately as that is easier and allows for verification that all the related pages link to the right article. bd will you please agree that we can do that or comment otherwise rather than proceeding some other way in cases where a change of name for a nonexistent article is eventually agreed upon? ,0
17998, blatant violation skag river queen has blatantly violated the rr. there was not yet a consensus. i asked to have the article protected a month ago.main article wikipediabiographies of living personswhen writing about controversies in the lead of the biography of a living person notable material should neither be suppressed nor allowed to overwhelm the blockquotes do overwhelm the article. srq made a unilateral decision to change two quotes instead of the one under discussion. in addition the blockquotes make the article look choppy. brb biographies of living persons must be written conservatively with regard for the subjects privacy. wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a tabloid paper it is not our job to be sensationalist or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about peoples lives. the possibility of harm to living subjects must be considered when exercising editorial judgment.to place such undue emphasis sensationalizes the article re old news making it of tabloid quality. i would have rather the both of us been blocked than the article. that would have left the possibility of someone without a negative pov and intent to harm to reasonably edit the article. to personally make changes because of the violation of the rr and unilateral decisions before blocking it would have been the better decision you said it was close and you are human ,0
