14006~ july utcalthough i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine. i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so. not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles. nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles. however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now. at some point however i will source his/her statements as soon as i find time to delve into the texts just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you. until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this. the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth. but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail. from wikipedia re. abbey road being the final album or notabbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles. although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded. ...after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days. .. just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album. martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be. in their interviews for the beatles anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note.re. the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road but it is followed by her majesty. in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on july her majesty followed mean mr. mustard......etc. this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people. ~0

14015~ august utcdear the hour block that you placed on my account yesterday for personal attacks has just expired and while i must say that i was not happy about the block i harbor no hard feelings towards you. if you check my previous contributions you can see that i have been a productive editor on wikipedia. id just like to let you know that while i was guilty of personal attacks against and i was goaded into doing so by these two individuals. in order to avoid future blocks i promise not to engage in anymore personal attacks and if i am goaded by trolls such as these two individuals i will simply ignore them. was repeatedly reverting a comment which i made concerning statements made in the hugo chavez article which i found to be biased. my issue with concerns his nastiness and uncivility. he is far too possessive of articles which he has created and he becomes very angry when edits are made to such articles. after multiple revisions of legitimate edits which i made to his articles i told him to leave me alone. he proceeded to foul my discussion page with unwanted and unsolicited comments. when i objected to this he goaded me into calling him a profanity.while i respect your role as a wikipedia administrator id like to respectfully request that in the future you exercise better discretion when blocking a user based on onesided information. thank you for your understanding ~0

14114~this needs an additional citation for the first part only refers to him now being labelled a cheat. henry has never been a fair footballer the match has just brought to light the foul play he has always used to get an upper hand even the biased french and arsenal fans realise. furthermore the quote by wenger that he is one of the fairest players i have managed holds no weight since it is a biased view from a man who managed henry for years. it is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at arsenal so saying henry is one of the fairest isnt saying much. in summary i think that the line should be changed tothe incident brought to light the true extent of henrys bad sportsmanship.simon~0

14165~agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. i was concentrating on the polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the czech experience needs to be included. czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s had closer ties with the west than poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was the west politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with poland. that said i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland the baltics yugoslavia or even ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea. while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war i think that the articles focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. after all there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union too who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy. oct utc~0

14175~neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published reliable sources. this is what you have quoted me? unfortunately that is not helpful. i appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion. my frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point. i have clearly laid out why this is not a pov piece and still not a single user has proven otherwise assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long? is that really a legitimate argument or is rjensen simply offended that i have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge.giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held view i am sorry you think i am in the minority. is the same conclusion reached by the world health organization aap cps dermatology associations worldwide and anyone who has actually objectively reviewed the literature and the tactics used by the industry. for people to say that i am in the minority perhaps in the court of public opinion but isnt that how propaganda works? there is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda this is not even open for debate. but these people are seriously compromising the integrity of this website by acting like gods claiming they know more about propaganda than i based on health information and an industry that they dont fully understand. i can by the way generalize about the industry as it is represented by the jcta which is the organization i cite in the article. on what basis cna they do this i ask all of them? and they suddenly become sensitive and cite wp ... and claim i am the one who is personally attacking them?~0

14225~kurdistan?kurdistan is not a geopolitical region. theres a region called kurdistan in iraq. theres a region called kurdistan in iran. theres no region called kurdistan in turkey. thats akin to placing an algeristan in france and making an article that treats it like a country. there are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. kurds are a minority in turkey just like the hispanics in usa or algerians in france. as ludicrous as it would seem to place a mexicistan or algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in it is to list a kurdistan that includes turkish territory. as long as we dont declare san diego mexicistan which mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a rippedup treaty claiming it it is equally ridiculous to list kurdistan in turkey. in iraq a country that was set up by the british merging territories a region called kurdistan warrants an article as the kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. but i call bs on turkey being listed under kurdistan as turkey does not have a region named kurdistan and kurds are turkish citizens not living under a kurdish state like in iraq whom prints their own passports and such. ~0

14244~indeed “learning curve.” i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully off i wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like arbcom’s wiki. that wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path. that took some reading and trial error. mediawiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan. it’s—like—about openness. ♬” the thing is those who don’t care to think about security wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing. however those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by i.p. then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what i did to file. like many things i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki. moreover installing imagemagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using ftp it’s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like templatext template template/doc templatehilite templatenbhyph templatenowrap and templatext. i think i have all the gottahaves now. i was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so i’m fond of them.i can’t complain about free stuff. mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $. i’ll take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day.~0

14253~ trimming sounds fine but where a dispute comes up i would recommend slowing things down. focus on one or two specific quotes and if someone reverts instead of immediately reverting back try to come up with a compromise version. ditto with the other person reverting instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version try to come up with a compromise. with each person changing each others work rather than reverting it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. also use clear calm and neutral edit summaries referring strictly to the article and not the editors. in terms of refactoring what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to. when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or hes just always stubborn then thats getting away from discussing the article content and is veering off into discussing the editors. better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors. good habits to develop though they can take time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your. also avoid naming specific editors in a post as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive and then they may miss everything else thats said. instead when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done diff the edit without mentioning the editor. like i disagree with this edit diff as i feel its a violation of policy/guideline. a better way to handle things would be suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this but i have seen that using this kind of thirdparty discussion technique can work wonders in deescalating disputes. it also tends to make whoever is using the technique sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful even if offwiki they may be hopping mad. it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action. when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute and they see everyone yelling at each other the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong. the admin wont care who started it theyll just address things as they see them in that moment. but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly and one editor being uncivil then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption. caveat just because one editor is being uncivil doesnt necessarily mean that theyre in the wrong. but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all theyre doing is namecalling rather than actually discussing the article then thats a problem that an administrator can easily address by removing the nonconstructive editors from the discussion. onka ~0

14255~i think wikipedia does have an obligation of respect and we do selfcensor quite a bit. we can show selfrestraint and respect and yet show the community what they want to see such as photos of the garments. there are no nude or seminude photos on other religious articles why start here? if a photo needs to be shared let it be current and without a live model or at least a model with a face why are they so ashamed to have their faces in the photos? ebay and flickr more have up to date photos not these from the s or s. this is completely offensive to the bulk of lds readers on wikipedia protecting the page is not the answer to keeping an image on it rather lets find something that the community can agree on and this current version it not it and undoubtedly as cogden stated end up with continuous vandalism of the page. ~0
