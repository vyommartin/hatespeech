2032~i repeat the text was about a minority school these schools were the same for every minority not about the treatment of germans in the public. secondly the weak identity thing is a nice lie because then you have to explain why the slovaks did not have weak identity in romania or in serbia and now there are more of them in those countries than in hungary although the opposite was the case after the population exchange i will answer you because their schools were shut down in the s. thirdly you somehow forget that whether the minorities not only slovak have a weak identity or not the hungarian government unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction you can play with words but that is a fact bilingual schools even if they would work which they did not are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the magyarisation and this aim was successfully achieved. or are you implying that since the minorities had such weak identity the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language?? do you actually read what you write? ~0
2033~xkcdhey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me randall munroe labeling it patently madeup information. understandable and taken in good humor of course and nothing on the page is sourced its more of a stub than anything. but im curious why you were so sure it was fabricated. xkcdi find it hard to believe that a yearold could have been working fulltime for nasa. of course you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe. schreit mich an i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated. i stayed for the better part of a year until late . nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects. its not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.anyway the information is taken from my published bio page but youre right you have no way of knowing whether im lying or not. i guess its probably safest to assume that i am.in that case ill admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place i know very little about science but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area. feel free to readd the info although the impression i got from the original version was more than you werent just a contract worker. if thats not even a valid distinction in the states its increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance. schreit mich an honestly they never really explained to me which one i was. i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots and nasa paid me through a government contractor. when i said i work for nasa no one argued. it was a lot more dilbertesque than you would expect. old echoing tile hallways with quiet gruff middleaged men working at blueprintcovered desks mild office politics lots of presentations and buzzwords and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way. i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work and it was good in a lot of ways but i was happy to leave. xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. actually this thing is new to me. thanks sure thing. the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook. that gets put onto the suggestions page which ill move it to in a moment. over the next few days people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long if it needs sources whatever else. if youre able to respond to those comments if there are any made then your article might get selected. schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what its not easy to do that since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page so i really cant just point you to a page and say here you are. what particularly do you want to see? if youre after examples of the kinds of comments people make just keep an eye on the suggestions page. schreit mich an caucasian ethnicitiessemites are caucasian. or indeed not. see for example semitic which clearly indicates otherwise. they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indoeuropean people who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless theres some startling new research out there i dont think that comment is accurate. schreit mich an im not even going to dignify this with a response. use~0
2034~verbal your pov is showing. i didnt choose the closing admin there was a neutral notice at wpan and jzg while he made a comment in the discussion wasnt involved any longer. it was not his action being reversed effectively but s and he had already recused himself. so lets find out what the actual consensus is if someone else doesnt beat me to it instead of blabbering more. ill be adding an external link and well see what happens. note that we already have an external link to lenr in martin fleischmann and that was heavily reviewed. we should have many more here as convenience links if nothing else. same wiht net.~0

2057~to respond generally to the statements made above its noteworthy to mention tillmans religion in light of the controversial statements made by ralph kauzlarich regarding the familys beliefs and how it relates to the investigation of his death. additionally since this is apparently hard to find the biography by jon krakauer refers to pat tillman as an agnostic and possibly even an atheist. im sure if someone wants to actually read the book they can find a relevant quote to include. on a more personal note this entire discussion topic stinks of religious paranoia....~0

2059~narking ok and that disproves my point how? i said that advisors are stationed in georgia proper buffer zones are un controlled areas of georgia proper so its a georgian mission. you said that advisors are stationed in georgia proper so its a georgian mission. well done xeeron i get . million links when i google south ossetia war. thats english buddy. if only xeeron you read the title security council holds third emergency meeting as south ossetia conflict intensifies expands to other parts of georgia south ossetia conflict war expands as in already expanded it says expands not expanding or about to expand therefore the un knowingly named the war the south ossetia war knowing that it will expand. see how important reading the title and getting the correct title is? my arguments havent evaporated anywhere south ossetia is still locationbased my initial argument it is still where over % of the fighting took place it still has the most important battle tskhinvali my arguments are still here buddy. and xeeron i have pointed to you countless times that might doesnt make right. saying the majority says so does not make it npov. if you would have lived in the south during the civil rights movenment youd realize that might doesnt make right or npov for that matter. ive seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. grey fox i have proof for how the georgia war is biased it is biased because it implies that south ossetia was a de facto part of georgia which as we all know is bullshit because if a region is de facto and de jure part of a country there is no war my russian colleagues may disagree but chechnya was not de facto part of russia in the s it was de jure. and it was called the second chechen war not the russian war . so in other words mr. grey fox and the other two of you you have failed to show my how south ossetia war is npov but i have shown you and cited an example of how georgia war would be incorrect and biased. therefore the title stays case closed. ~0

2088~thanks for the copyedit omg it reads so professional. i appreciate it a lot. yeah i knew that that would be a problem. okay heres the back story to it. danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. during the after party in which the theme was a black light one everybody could see that danny still had paint on him as it hadnt washed off or something. to be sure jack had a black light switch in his apartment and when liz came in he turned it on which resulted in liz having the paint all over her see here. or if whatever i just said doesnt make sense read here and here about the paint still on danny and the black light attack.yeah i thought maybe if people saw that the ga note they wont leave me a message. though that didnt work as a user left me a message regarding an article i reviewed. this has to work in the future. im a have to make it better. i still havent gotten the chance to see it but i have to see it. i need to know what happened and stuff. well after i got the news that he lost i started watching his dvd and telling myself that ill never see his wrestling moves again. i didnt cry i was just sad. the night on raw i lost it and cried. whatever i didnt think that was cool. shawn didnt mind but i did. not really i still dont see that face like quality to him. i think theyll play randy out like triple h you know good with the crowd but still have him heelish. maybe cause all the new people are heel and they need some faces... who knows. speaking of randy todays his birthday turned . well if you remember his first punted victim was shawn so nice to see that he did that to cody... all in the storyline nici. you are welcome for danielson and miz i guess. hit ~0

2103~negatively biased articlethe following was entered into the article text in these edits by ... whomever wrote this wikipedia information has a clear bias and is absolutely against dr. albert rivera. in this biograpgy he is promptly attacked as a fraud before and after stating the life of dr. alberto. the refrences of public magazines where dr. rivera is pointed as a fraud are commentary opinionated and are not mere fact. it is clear that dr. riveras life is quite controversial and to discredit him is the easiet form to invalidate his claims. out of evident knowledge dr. alberto was not anticatholic he only spoke what he lived. it would be quite contradicting to have been not only a roman catholic but a jesuite and then be margined as anticatholic. obviously this would be the best label in order for catholics to reject and discard whatever dr. rivera has said.~0

2139~as far as i know there were no warrants of arrest for thomas jefferson from the british crown. there is nothing in the writings of thomas jefferson that states he was committing treason and could be hung. jefferson washingtion and adams according to ferling believed they were slaves to the british government not having any rights. they did not view themselves as outlaw rebels rather they wanted to be free to make their own laws that protected white people. franklin apparently is the only founding father who mentioned being hung. was jefferson in the room at the time franklin made this statement?~0

2185~ can someone explain criticism to me? this is taken from the criticisms section of the article. since logic is inherently constant and that some things are more true than others it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. an example of a similar phenomenon is the gay marriage debate in the u.s. an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. can someone explain what exactly this means? i do not follow the first half of the paragraph the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me especially this part...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.i do not think thata the majority in question believes that it doesnt apply to them. though im not sure what it is in this context so the sentence may be true. the majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society which of course applies to everybody in that society.b the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views. its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed for the benefit of society it is aware of the effects and does not object to them. ~0

2212~the spelling tacarimba la tumba del fuego santa maliga sacategas lo onto del sol y cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of side by side by sondheim available for rental only. this version of the song however misspells llanfair pg presumably to approximate the pronunciation and has the lyric ...todays the last ill be spreading rather than spending. it would seem therefore that this source cannot be considered canonical. this rendering of the place name does accord with millicent martins recording on the side by side by sondheim cast album however.the published version of the song as contained in the hansen treasury of stephen sondheim songs charles hansen music books has the lyric printed as tacarembo la tumbe del fuego santa malipas zacatecas la junta del sol y cruz and being a printed source as opposed to handwritten as is the vocal score can presumably be considered definitive. linda lavins pronunciation on the original cast recording of the mad show for which the song was written follows this spelling which would suggest that the printed version is correct.as it is a fictional place name however any discussion of correct spelling/pronunciation is an academic one at best.~0
2213~banging your head against a wall hi i see jayjg has been leaving messages on your page with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness. in reality jayjg is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light. along with many of his cohorts.the problem is that jayjg is part of the wikipedia cabal. when there were elections despite massive efforts to the contrary a number of people got a higher vote percentage than jayjg but jimbo wales put him on arbcom anyhow. jimbo has shown his true colors as well.these people control wikipedia. they are all together and attacking you. no one is coming to your aid. this is because they control wikipedia with jimbo at the center and have more or less driven off everyone else. you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up disorted justified etc. anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here.my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative like a wiki encyclopedia that is not prozionist and antimuslim like this one. or if you do continue here for a little bit to spend less time. it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than . eventually you will give up here everyone does. you are fighting a losing battle.~0

2299~hello deacon thanks for the kind words. your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar? but theres no great preference here either way.oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the th century ... have a look at the skene reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way.it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony. northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly mercia and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones. im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons.the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article. regards ~0

2318~ivo banac...a bit of nonteleological historyone of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. for example if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. croatia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river a little bit to the east of the city of split. down the coast from the original croatia we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus the tenthcentury byzantine emperorhistorian called pagania literally land of the pagans zachlumia most of presentday eastern herzegovina with the croatian peninsula of peljesac terbounia the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina with dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs and dioclea the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of presentday albania around lake skadar/shkoder. serbia is located in the hinterland of zachlumia terbounia and dioclea its center around ras near todays novi pazar in the sandzak. bosnia was apparently within this territory but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river where we now find sarajevo and its environs. and dalmatia? in the tenthcentury this was a necklace of byzantineruled roman coastal cities and island territories from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south.moreover modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. thus unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnicas opposed to culturalcontinuity. the croat historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of dioclea a twelfthcentury text from bar in contemporary montenegro and its various translations for example marko marulic which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and dalmatian histories of mavro orbin and ivan lucic ioannes lucius . these works then became material for the croatianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic croatia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of ljudevit gaj and that of postrevival integral nationalists like ante starcevic . curiously the same histories orbins were serbianized through the translations of sava vladislavic which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of jovan rajic and were bulgarianized in the history of paisij hilandarski . the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more selfcontained. it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan notable selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia for example antun knezevic whose book was published between and .clearly something has happened in the span of ten centuries. pagania zachlumia and terbounia have disappeared. the center of croatia has migrated from the adriatic to the north into medieval slavonia literally slavic land with zagreb at its head. this happened in stages. during the high middle ages the heart of croatia was on the una river now in northwestern bosnia. this territory turkish croatia was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia. during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century the framework of modern croatia emerged in two extended shanksone to the north to modern slavonia the other in the south in modern dalmatia. at the same time the zagreb area which was only dubiously croatian in the early middle ages became the heart of modern croatia.the story of serbia is not much different. serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated dioclea. then it moved to the ibarmorava valleys then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia. it reached the danube only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. and its modern capital belgrade became truly serbian only in the course of karadjordjes uprising in . bosnia too expanded under ban or prorex kulin r. into the donji kraji literally lower lands around the vrbas river and the soli literally salt lands for centuries ottoman then modern tuzla and usora in its present northeastern corner. later on at the height of its power in fourteenth century bosnia expanded into hum herzegovina and the drina river valley. the westernmost regions were inc~0

2353~sure theyre subjective theyre rhetorical i was arguing a case. i still think that the single arrival point article to which all others direct should be the most neutral. i believe that that when dealing with periods in the past should be assumed to be the title used in the subjects own time necessarily adjusted for the english language in an e lang encyclopedia here philip the tetrarch. the herod philips have to be there because people will search for them. these pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time and then send the seeker to the historical name. if someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that theologians use ... and historians use ... that would be a welcome addition. this means that all the terms would be in wikipedia they would all be findable and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information and i trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. i dont want to move any pages just tidy up the way of finding them. i dont think this is as strong an advice as you do more of a signpost perhaps a better image than guide? in particular i was astonished when i began this by the confusion over hp i hp ii. evidence for the elder philip seems minimal.~0

2370~history of primal therapy articlei read through the recent discussions on talkprimaltherapy. i also added two more comments to the talkarthurjanov page. did you send an email enquiry? the date for france ds marriage to art is without credibility. after the divorce to vivians great credit she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov. after all he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated. chapter . and according to france d. janovs own admission in the primal centers video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. so its a fact that art married a former patient.my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. it isnt really the place to dissect janovs reputation. i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies but in many cases it has got out of hand. i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article. the conocer piece doesnt strike me as a sound source of verifiable information so i put together some links to articles which can be found onlineif you type emotional intelligence into google the no. result is steve heins website. he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janovs primal center in the late s. you can find his interview notes here labelled cautionary note.janovs bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr. janov’s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr. erik hoffman former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university. you can read what erik hoffmann ph.d. is doing now at hoffmanns website.on this page you can find a transcript of dr. e. michael holdens account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute.carol mithers book therapy gone mad identifies case histories from janovs first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy. simon thanks simon why cant you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page? i dont think the history idea will come to much there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingolds latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. i have already read the michael holden swan song twice sad case. you seem to be applying two standards of evidence. the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janovs books alone which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. last september i wrote in the primal therapy talk page will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbachers method or the international primal association or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the s? there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article for a start two books about the center for feeling therapy erik hoffmanns bio and the transcript of dr. e. michael holdens audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in . the books by carol mithers and tomas videgård are already referenced in the main article. i have a copy of videgårds book by the way. also professor steven rose wrote a onepage account of his research with arthur janov in lifelinesas janov had hoped it turned out that before therapy the quantity of these particular receptors in his clients platelets was considerably below normal. within six months of therapy clients depression had lifted and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for normal nondepressed people of the same age and sex.further down the same page he addedi obtained similar biochemical results when a couple of years later i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other less dramatic forms of psychotherapy so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.having participated in the editing of articles in t~0

2377~ recap i decided to withhold further comment until i had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. i am delaying a trip this morning so that i can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.your supporting statement for deletion is as follows the result was delete. the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic and i have counted those opinions as being from userjulie dancer. kevin talk as for the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm... in reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance. within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by at that other algorithms exist namely examples of relevant works are a fast bottomup decision tree pruning algorithm with nearoptimal generalization and an efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees. which are capable of performing the function the article title namesif this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.in anticipation of these other algorithms being added i immediately changed the body of the text to read the algorithm used for this purpose... to one algorithm used for this purpose... since i do not now have access to the articles history as the result of your deletion i can not give you the exact date and time. however it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. incidentally it has been suggested by a professor at cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.normally as a wikipedia user i would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the wikipedia was setup this way. the wikipedia still claims to be ...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. the impression i have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. they simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. as for ...references not supporting the notability of the subject you can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted. all of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which i deferred. just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. i know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.as for the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... this shows you did not read or comprehend the response i made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. i explained that each of the user names were created so that i could track the use of my own resources better similar to the need on the part of the wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots but currently i am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the wikipedia and mining it off line.since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w~0

2382~ why will gwen gale not read the sources? on august i posted a section on talk death of adolf hitler titled “random questions” which started “i am not a scholar i read wiki but would not think of editing it. but i was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so i am asking some questions. perhaps someone else will read and address them.” the section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with “as to sources the last books i have read are the murder of adolph hitler by hugh thomas sort of shaky and the last days of hitler by anton joachimsthaler english translation i buy much of this.”gwen gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at she replied with ”as the article lead says...this said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. i say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought up...dodgy. gwen gale talk”by this reply it appears that gwen gale is not familiar with the work of joachimsthaler who i have just referenced and thinks that i am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one. at that time i apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions.at i posted” if i had read kershaws nemesis chapter note and epilogue note i wouldnt have wasted your time. you cant get much clearer than that. should be required reading. perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article. thank you for your time.... talk”at i posted “i would like to direct people to the work of ian kershaw hitler nemesis isbn . chapter and the epilogue relate to this article. please pay attention to his notes and sources. be warned his book hitler a biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....the source joachimsthaler is basically an english translation of a germans analysis of s postsoviet interviews of bunker survivors. the original transcripts must be available somewhere. there are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree. wm talk“since those posts i have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which gwen gale has disputed. much of the material i have posted i have later deleted often because i felt that the endless conflict between gwen gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. anyone who is wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. was i sometimes rude and argumentative? absolutely. was i making legitimate points which related to the article? i thought so. did i receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? i think not but you judge.my main point was that joachimsthaler had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which kershaw backed. i repeatedly begged anyone especially gwen gale to read joachimsthaler and kershaw specifically two footnotes i even told the pages of the footnotes. gwen gale clearly had not read either source. i posted under the heading “question for gwen gale” the following ”i lost you but i’m confused myself. it appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.my very low budget suburb is in a system which serves people with million titles numbers approximate thanks carol. kershaw joachimsthaler thomas trevorroper beevor shirer ryan toland eberle/uhl lehmann/carroll o’donnell victor petrova/watson. vinogradov hit a snag reordered. these are books which i have had in my possession and read parts of since aug . i can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but i think that should be addressed. if someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressed...i know that this is p.o.v. and that i am personally involved. but i can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s talkon gwen gale posted “for starters the russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule. gwen gale talk”. by this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either joachimsthaler or kershaw that gwen gale is still not familiar with either work. joachimsthaler was first referenced by me at august and kershaw was referenced by me at august and i believe that they were both on t~0

2410~i think it is both a khmer character and a tamil character then. the problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly but that it did not represent the sound w like the other characters in the logo. the khmer character does not represent w either. talk according to wikipediawikipedia logosalphabets represented in the logo they do represent the letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the english w as in wikipedia.however according to nohat at user talknohat/archive trouble in all the logos only some of the symbols were selected to represent wikipedia— others were chosen at random. and threads at user talknohat/archive say the same thing. angela says the same thing in metatalkmain page/archives//error in the wikipedia globe. zocky repeats it at talkmain page/archive wrong devnagari symbol for wi in wikipedias logo. the only remaining tiny flaw i can see in your logo thue is the topright piece klingon r is lacking any depth there should be a black edge to the piece but instead we see the grey of the inside. not very important at all though. ah i and the person who reported the problem with the tamil/khmer character thought that all the characters should represent w. but that is obviously not the case. imo the klingon r is within stylistic freedom so i guess the logo is correct now. when at first you dont succeed redefine success . talk acousmatic hi there you suggested a merger but you did not start a discussion i think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. instead i would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to acousmatic sound so that the page can function as a subsecion of acousmatic music which is a particular form of electroacoustic music one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. the acousmatic sound article might focus more on schaefers and chions theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context. ~0

2477~ december utcyep. lol the reformist party serbiareformist party is having another go the th very last on the parliamentary election winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned. by the way heres something very little people have figured out the new constitution of serbia has been brought to enable kosovo secession. the constitution barred that as a possibility and after the kumanovo militarytechnical agreement was signed between nato and fry the srs broke its coalition with sps and the government collapsed causing new elections because that was unconstitutional as an act of highest treason enough to be tried from maximum sentence which the radicals demanded from then to his death to have a trial in serbia and to be tried for treason among other reasons. this constitution releases the authorities from that weight and they wont have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in kosovo. ~0

2490~ hu administrator apparent libel and abuse report to a chairhello this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for mount hood done by administrator hu. toward the bottom at the issue stems from as youll see in the articles history section my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for dan howitt with the press article references.hus postafter going through the google results a disturbing education of sorts there appears to be a long line of aliases for dan howitt posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. it has been removed. id suggest that dan howitt read the following wikipediawikipedia is in the real world and law of unintended consequenceshumy replyplease remove hus libel and vandalism above and please report this users abuse to wikipedia administration. also hu of the google results you searched most are in support of dan howitt with tons of his official summit photos on rainier adams hood shasta and listings of his timing officials. you strangely give weight to the abusive chatsite gossip and unsupported libel and your own post above is of that nature. chatsites with this sort of conduct are sad. im reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki talk note hu cites a link above as support for his allegations of dan howitt. in reading the chatsite thread and note its a mere chatsite and has a lot of personal attacks gossip unfounded content libel etc you will nevertheless find considerable support for howitt including climbing record photos timing officials names etc. hu emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases and this is gossip and unsupported.~0

2496~skookum nd note about the above. theres situations again with somena mentioned elsewhere where the people and government are somewhat indeterminate and well as indistinguishable in the somenas case because theyre not a legal government but one of the ancient social divisions of the peoples of the cowichan valley what we might call a chieftaincy but thats an imposed concept if you read the somena page youll see what i mean....i think. bottom line is frankly were imposing a rational order based on our concepts separate concepts of ethnicity language and government in some first nations culture thats a lot harder to do so the somena are not a first nations government in the white mans way of thinking or even in the thinking of the union of bc indian chiefs which is an organization of whitemansystem band governments and tribal councils created by the indian act the reserve system and government agents et al but it would be touchy to exclude the somena from equal status in a template say with their neighbours/kin the quamichan. all too confusing for a cultus whiteman at this hour of the night so im going to bed now.... ~0

2521~after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in the angloirish physicist g. johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity. he was able to estimate the value of the charge e of a monovalent ion by means of faradays laws of electrolysis. this means that chemistry is part of the definitio if the electron. the value of charge was equated to faradays laws of electrolysis. there should be an section in the electron article on chemistry. and if your going to mention obscure virtual electrons why not mention chrystal fields because that is fundamental to chemistry. if your going to mention quantum physics why cant you mention quantum chemsitry because i think chemistry is just as important to physics if not more important. and i think there should be a section on electrolysis.~0

2529~replacementplease do not edit below this note. the whole suprasection will disappear again once i am able to post on the article talk page.this includes you shell. had you not blocked me i would have been able to place my answers there. this will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.because shell falsely blocked me i cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. hence i will save the entire page minus the archived sections here. pov concerns im surprised this article isnt being called antisemetic because its has a few traces of islamic perspectives in it. you know as opposed to being a piece of zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.this entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. it is well documented the banu qurayza were executed for treason. that is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason. the quarash and other tribes the muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. but the qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy. this article contains soo much jewish propaganda that youd think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim. here is a great example. look at this citationaccording to stillman muhammad chose sad ibn muadh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the banu qaynuqa and the banu nadir sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. furthermore stillman infers from abu lubabas gesture that muhammad had decided the fate of the qurayza even before their surrender.this author is norman a stillman a zionist jew who is very biased. why is he being used as a quote in an islamic article? and further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if its a fact?there are articles for criticisms of islam where the jews and others can write whatever they want. but they should have no hand in editing islamic articles. because i looked up the jewish articles and i noticed they dont allow dissent there. you cant put a muslim perspective on evil acts commited by jews without it disappearing instantly. so the same standard must be applied to islamic articles. islamic articles must be written from the islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of islam articles. if not i will personally edit the jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. and i will find a nonjewish admin to arbitrate over the islamic articles.good day. please read this talk page specifically all of the places where treason or traitor is mentioned and if you still believe that we need to mention treason provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it. it is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all povs but it does require that people like yourself participate. we work from academic sources not personal conjecture. changes by devotus and issues with themdear devotus i have still issues with your changesbat yeor and ramadan while i appreciate that you dont try you shift the balance removing a book from each side i do not agree with your removal. bat yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial she is not beyond the pale currently she doesnt serve as a reference in the article but if she did the controversy would be noted. as for ramadan i have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section we would have to remove him from the article too in which he serves as a reference. this is due to the insistence of userbless sins. he will certainly not like such a removal. we cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.while your first version was needlessly verbose it is to be noted that the new one endorses that view by paret/watt. the article now says that the bq were not killed for religious reasons that is not a fact since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the siege and demise e.g. the claim about attacking m. in the rear.also please abide by the one resolved conflict. we fought hard and long about words like massacre and execution and neither should appear unless unavoidable.the common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s~0

2574~ silesians andrew i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia. i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project. assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. i inquired about silesian/polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist. good luck with the article. olessi thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion. you are right that the work of a person is most important.however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace. if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up. to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist. i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition. seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german/silesian/polish guy. it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well. so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement.with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned. for some to hundred years there were under german governments. they had bad time as you possibly can imagine. many of them married with german and were/are of course confused who they are. you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued. finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. there in poland was complete disorder. soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way. “national” government just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. polish borders were shifted. we lost some % of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland. you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people. they spoke different polish dialect also. on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately i am. this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally. thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much. i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans.now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations.finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often naïve. not many realize that politic need caution. those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers. i am also convinced there exists something like national character. you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own.returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column on polish terytory in addition.sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich i still have with ge wiki. they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. that sucks.sorry and thanks again. feel free to contact me any time you need.best regards andrew december~0

2589~ work in comparisons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions first ill say thank you for helping me in the the article ive been out of wikipedia and didnt had much time to work on. second despite the good points you added to the subject i fear what you added may not be accepted by the pronuclear side. i can live with that it contain all info i need and for me its fine. unfortunately you cannot put antinuclear studies in evidence and put all the rest in others section. if you want the pronuclear people accept what you did you have to put at least pronuclear study and antinuclear study.thanks you again for your help. ~0

2591~article revised for flow and minor correctionsi have made a start on editing the article’s minor errors of grammar syntax and flow. i hope this is acceptable to the other editors who have already done such a good job here. although i have changed the order of some of the information trying to lead from the general to the particular i have not removed any so far as i am aware. i have added some details about the attack on the cornerstone ceremony. i have also revised the numbers of aggressors and victims in this attack in line with those in the existing cited sources. i’m not sure where the article’s original figure of serbs came from. have i overlooked a reference? if so i apologize and ask that it be restored. anyway this change may well be temporary if someone can find other equally or more reliable souces.if the established editors here are unhappy with what ive done please feel free to revert.i think the article could use quite a few more cites.~0
2592~tbmai think its very unfair to compare my edits with those of tbma/ymb first i have been the main contributor to this article i have seeked the sources/ disscused in discusion all in line to improve this article this is not the case with tbma/ymb who just last week consider the whole article a hoax also today i really displined myself not doing any of the previuslly acts of misconduct so i think your crttisism of me is utterlly talk july utc~0
2593~thanks for that. ill take a deep breath and have a go at an intro tomorrow. i identified the source of the phrase london over the border and showed that the boundary is contested in the footnote. ive clarified the diaspora section and will justify the statements by reference to the victoria history articles on west ham and east ham. hopefully ill struggle to a justification without substantially changing the outcome of the previous discussions. then move onto to standardising the references probably section by section.~0

2602~de jure simply means in law literally regarding law. according to law the queen is head of state in the commonwealth realms and in the united kingdom. de facto means in fact that is for all practical purposes but not accordingly to law. a de facto head of state would be one who governs practically but without due process of law such as the leader of a coup or a usurper. even when a country is presided over by a person acting as a regent such as the prince regent george who became george iv or a governorgeneral in the commonwealth realms the reigning sovereign remains de jure head of state. please let us not resurrect the awful discussion about who is elizabeth really queen of. it took up pages and created a lot of heat and bad feeling.~0

2613~kenneth tennysons reckless behavior in other forums==as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors here is an exerpt from a book review on founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement never studied under a legitimate teacher or any martial art teacher never set foot in asia completely disproven shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson et al. was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and ill enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what exstudents say at him a propaganda liemaster. the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsportwhile putting others down kenny brags or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare peoplehmmm... well kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera alot of jumping and posturing and a lot of religious themes to it. i guess it depends on what martial arts youve trained in to determine whether i can kick a$$ or not. lets see... im a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. ive got to start learning about grappling though. freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist. here are some excerpts from users from other forumsthe armchair analyst asia times forumi see. however you sounded like a racist.no i have no south asian sensitivities. i am no nationalist/jingoist. i consider myself above it all. all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness. it may be in a narrow anglosaxon way but not in a gandhibuddha sort of a way. get it?civilizations such as india actually even china until today have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.you have generalized indians to be bigots etc. i agree that some not all are. but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist. yes it does rocky asia times forumwhat inaccuracy are you referring to? if brits came to india and got rich was the wealth indian or british? besides looting what exactly did british accomplish? while your bias is clearly visible with this statement what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?isnt it quiet evident that even in yr it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass why on earth would anything written by anglosaxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? thats just a couple of the many others. however i do not want to clog up this page.i have also noticed that kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites i know that i am not the only one who knows thisbrahman martial arts planet forumi really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning. bliss asia times forumthats not from a social studies journal you fraud thats a copy paste... rocky asia times forumi believe kenneth probably picked up a website of some tourist board~0

2707~the marvels and mysteries of cite web hei sorry i didn’t respond earlier. was through all the material on using and the time got away. only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet herr professor omberg for breakfast and then on to do what must be done for the day. but now that there is time to write this is what i understand using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent and apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into webcite to request a permanent archive. somehow – should the link rot as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from webcite and repoint the reference so it is still live if this is a correct understanding then using is a virtuous thing to do and i will do it. for this insight thank you skål ~0

2728~the fact that azeris are mixed turkic speaking people that sprung from the turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear. they were and are in the location that was arran that consistent of albanians and iranian tribes. furthermore the fact that the entire area was called arran then for some reason was renamed azerbaijan is another indication that azeris were not a turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the caucus next to the sakas. no one said azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other iranians in fact iranians are a multiethnic multi lingual group much like the kurds in the west have a different language/customs as do balochies in the south. what happened to iranians in arran intermittingly in which the turks invaded their tribes and the albanians were driven out and imposed their language on them via elite dominance does not change their original ancestry. you have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the azeris came from why they even appear/are part of iran even today and why these ethnic groups even have a persian culture? in all you can concentrate on their differences but fail to explain where did azeris come from? it is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts and write pages of texts about germanic peoples in an article about iranian peoples. i think i’ll stop at that.~0

2737~nihonjoe in my understanding of your role as one of tenmeis mentors approved by the arbitration committee youre supposed to help the air of any discussion between tenmei and others. of course if you have concerns about my presentation skills i would be gladly accept your criticism if you leave that comment at my talk page. i think your above personalized comment is not very helpful for the discussion. as for your assertion of wpotherstuffexists the method is already used by tenmei with the three nonenglish wikipedias. im bit worried that you dont see that. everyone can challenge the trustworthiness of wikipedia projects and as stated wikipedia is not a reference. how can you prove that the argument that the title used in the three wikipedias are more neutral and usage of wpenglish based on what? we dont know where each title at each wikipedia follows wikipedia naming convention rules correctly. i think the mention of oei invasion is a good comparison for tenemi to see how he treats similar subjects differently. also i totally disagree with your view on the tenmeis mentions the nonenglish blue~0

2743~ vfs max size this may sound random but wikipedia led me astray on my home work and i should try to prevent it for others. the given max size inthe actual maximum was bytes with singlyindirect blocks and doublyindirect block pwb/unix .s variant had singlyindirect blocks making the maximum bytes or half a mib.is incorrect.according to the version manual the max size is but cannot be larger than bue to only storing bits of filesize info in each inode rather than . the number obtained above was the result of calculating it with byte addresses which is obviously incorrect given the definition in the manual. ~0

2755~jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a rightwing force? as far as im aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all. the consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin hamish mcdonald roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show.the only dissenters im aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. for example even the foremost scholary expert on fascism and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy renzo de felice doesnt try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status. this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini. ~0

2822~hi i just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. i think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. also none of the information under applications is cited. if this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. under references reference list is misspelled. also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. if you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. the analogies in the hologram and holonomy under theory overview was very helpful to understand the concept. ~0

2850~the sims expansion and stuff packs listing together? since the good article review suggested that the sims expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing my question is this if we decide to split the sims games i.e. core game with expansion and stuff packs onto one listing should we remove the sims stuff packs article and merge it into a new article with core / expansion pack / stuff pack article listing? i think the core / expansion pack / stuff pack article is wise and thus eliminating the stuff pack article in my honest opinion because we dont need two lists of stuff packs. so this is a public vote and note the good article review is in the archive article page see archive list above for link. sundogs talk page sandbox~0

2860~re tigerdirect has always relied very heavily on rebate marketing and this has been true in the least for several years and their failure to honor them has made them as big as they are toda. that is baloney. that statement reflects pure bias. you can go count the number of rebates on and youll find less there than you find on amazon or newegg or any of other competitors. regarding the attorney generals complaint you also have to note that in response to the complaint tigerdirect argued that its not true. if you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and ce reseller in the country.what is clear is that a whole bunch of editors have a hard on for tigerdirect. those who cry about others povs and bias are usually the same ones who will stop at nothing to spread their ownwelldisguised under the heading of facts ~0

2866~to expand on one aspect of that wikipedias three main content policies arewpneutral point of view which peridon mentionedwpverifiability all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable published source... the threshold for inclusion in wikipedia is verifiability not truth—whether readers can check that material in wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source not whether editors think it is true.wpno original research the term original research or is used on wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts allegations and ideas—for which no reliable published source exists.the last two mean that content based on your extensive participation in two of the three events making me very knowledgeable of what occurred both in public and private with a bare minimum of conjecture is not acceptable as a basis for additions to the article. i hope your question is adequately answered so i have turned off the helpme please add another if you need more advice. regards ~0
2867~i think theres little doubt that there is taking in both directions here. more than likely the world golf hall of fame used the wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website. unless the earlier wikipedia article copied from another source which they later also used. she was inducted into the world golf hall of fame in and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point. but the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in this evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in august it was sources probably circularly to the wghof and the snippet of their text pasted in.meanwhile not all but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with wpcopypaste. for now ill clumsily address it with quotation marks. talk~0

2901~so i hope you will oppose any version of fr that would not have prevented this case as not being fit for purpose. in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have % prevented the ted kennedy incident.i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all. i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare. why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? and any interested observers please stop before you say it these valid concerns with what fr is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant advantage of fr of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles.and to further address the specific example you give maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim when it was added to the article along with another sentences which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax and at worst screams delete me now for being total wpbollocks. we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is % complete bollocks? even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. a systemic failure perhaps?and finally as an admin perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now blocked irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. incidentally the now famous bad account on ted kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article. another systemic failure?im all for criticla analysis of cases fr would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer about the whole model of wikipedia never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations. ~0

2936~pretty much what i said the first day this was posted. now i have neither a problem with the cabals decision nor in the cabals logic as deamon does. my concern is why a vote that basically said i dont know means it stays at burma. by the cabals conclusion...if the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation and we had the same cabal it would now be a myanmar article. i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy. however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision? you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma. husond is right where does this end? when i first looked at this mess i said and posted that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. there are good points for each argument. im in the burma camp but that is how i see things. so im looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. choice just doesnt look that appealing. ~0

3004~ narciso yepes please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. yepes collaborated with ramirez not bernabe to invent his guitar. bernabe an apprentice of ramirez later formed his own shop and yepes subsequently played a bernabe string. as for your comment about yepess hands this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of yepes. i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available depending on what best served the music. do you have these proofs??? no. so please stick to what you actually know. fyi yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first strings d together with the low g on the th string by using the left hand thumb. again we have the proof of this. it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions. —preceding unsigned comment added by ... your discussion at narciso yepes first you added information that was not correct except for the reason you gave for yepess death. and it is not constructive to to add biased unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious...second it is a wellestablished fact that ramirez and yepes invented his tenstring guitar. as i said bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then but the first yepestype tenstring guitar was a ramirez guitar. moreover ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra damor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar. this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical. it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way c a g f alongside the normal strings. you want a verifiable source? here ramirez iii jose. . the tenstring guitar in things about the guitar. bold strummer. pp. . isbn third i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings f or g are very often played fretted rather than open i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant unconstructive remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar. furthermore yepes frequently uses the th fretted because it is the lowest string but not frequently the th as you mistakenly claim which is a minor th higher than the th string. moreover these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by nonguitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string except in the edited versions. being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepess entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though i will add many tenstring guitarists today who are secondrate guitariats in general have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. this has nothing to do with yepess own performance practice on his instrument. as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepess leading longterm students as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations i can safely say that i know what i am talking about. yepes even frets a and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations which exist only in your imagination you know nothing.~0

3010~bjp +confirm?~1
3011~i disagree. the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if cameron were to die/resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt. clegg may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.~0

3060~ removed pov i removed undo criticism of secretary boutwell and pov. wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. the following has been removed from the article.boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation. intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. he believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception henry adams wrote in a muchquoted analysis in . he believed in common schools and not in political science in ledgers and cashbooks but not in adam smith or mill as one might believe in the multiplicationtable but not in laplace or newton. by a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.henry adams the session north american review july p. . but in a very corrupt time it spoke well of boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his cabinet post either for himself or his friends. living within his salary he lodged in a boardinghouse throughout his tenure. his only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money. chicago times march . he is an inaccessible man uninfluenced by fear favor affection or hope of reward and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred a new england politician wrote his brother. henry f. french to benjamin b. french march benjamin b. french papers library of congress.boutwells financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments but while boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of washington remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.~0

3069~good information going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible should we then create a different article for the gong baotian and xie pieqi styles? rather than dilute the style information of each style my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm. perhaps one called xie pieqi line yin style baguazhang and another gong baotian line yin style baguazhang. for each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources splits from the main article seem to make sense to me.~0

3073~ defence of peacful schools of thought against wahhabi jihad continues. quote from allama shamis raddulmukhtar about the first wahhabi wave the state of the followers of ibn abdul wahhab was like this they rose from nejd and attacked our holy cities mecca and medina in hejaz. they killed everyone who did not confirm to ibn abdul wahhab. then allah send the armies of muslims to push them back to nejd. rest assured it seems until oil runs dry in saudi arabia the second wave of violent wahhabi jihad against peaceful muslims would continue. ~0
3074~ the less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is british irish isles. believe when i say that the manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the u.k. as a protected and supported territory republic of ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the u.k.did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the british isles. place names reflect current realities thus we have istanbul and not constantinople. a better example would be the aegean coast of turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the greek coast and all the islands were greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the turkish state has jurisdiction the only islands which are now greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of greece. if you were to rebut by saying that british refers to something more than a political term but rather than an ethnic or geographical one then the same argument or even a better one can be made of greek. the greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient greece e.g. southern italy sicily turkey armenia etc and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated greek are ethnically and linguistically greek but live in the state of turkey and therefore the islands and coast are turkish. thus you could not refer to the island of ireland as british.~0

3105~paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized. however the term fossilized is not a very precise term. there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil. one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc. and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc. talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned.the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in? experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue. the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains. flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working. much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains. yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.~0

3108~your serious mental illness and addictionthis is the most contructive thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here please stop and think about the depth of your sickness sitting there with your face glued to your computer screen uncompensated day after day week after week for years tinkering with the biographies of people you dont even know who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction. you have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely selfdestructive addiction and illness which has been at the expense of living your own life. the depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you. i know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness. its something of an inside joke and i guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless. thats not right either and id ask them to please stop that and try to help you. dont laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters. that lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. something is very wrong with him/her and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem we should pause to help with advice. please share with him/her what we all know. its only humane to do so. i will do so now toojerzy or whatever your name isconsciously concealed im sure to keep your illness as private as possible please consider some uncomfortable facts years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep deep sickness and obvious addiction. please dont make excuses for yourself. you cannot go on like this any longer. you need to stop and you need to stop today. reject this advice and i worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life. please stop. its over. enough. move on. i do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously. it will be the first and last time i share it and i hope you know that i share it only with your best interests in mind. its sad what has happened to you but i wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful. but please take itand do so today. you cannot go on like this.~0

3113~well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wpdbad here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here i mean the talkinternational recognition of kosovo page. as far as the wprm if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure im still not sure that there is one. moreover im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed. persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wparbmac probation this article is under the scope of. concerning the closure of proposal. im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wprm. actually i find wprm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wprm but then i might misunderstood something. i might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter. hus as a formalist as i consider you at the moment i must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. i suppose i pointed out one might consider ive used irony i apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least. maybe some other place exists which im not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself. not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action ? / . sorry for that.ijanderson you asked why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia? well actually i do consider this title is biased also. but personally i consider the irok more globally important not just to me as one might think it is. if the bias is dealt with this issue irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also. and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place > maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea.all the best. s talk ~0
3114~ frederic bourdin. hey jimboyour bbb did not step back instead he asked a friend admin. calling him to help him with this matter against me. you have a open door policy right and when i came nicely explaining what the problem was and that i would be very happy to end it even though i did not feel it was fair it seemed to me that you really wanted to help. but i got blocked again and again for nothing. let say im not very happy about that because its obvious to me that the bad guys are winning. you know i cant be blocked for long though since im a pretty good brain with computers thats not why im mad. im mad because you lied to me. all the people involved against me here are biaised so of cpurse unfair. and i wont let it go and no matter what i will have to do i shall do it. your actions have been unfair and unwarranted. and even the great jimbo is not going to stand up for some fairness. well see then. good night ... ~0

3119~accusation of plagiarism =ynhockey you have made a rather serious accusation plagiarism against me .however plagiarism occurs when someone elses material is misrepresented as one owns work. how can my edits be plagiarism since i clearly referenced the source material haaretz? i think you have confused plagiarism and copyright. from plagiarismplagiarism is not copyright infringement. while both terms may apply to a particular act they are different transgressions. copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder when material protected by copyright is used without consent. on the other hand plagiarism is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing authors reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship.contentsyou wil find that using the sentences in question fall under fair use.regardless plagiarism is a serious and in this case untrue accusation to make and i consider your behaviour a violation of wpcivil.~0

3187~hey i tried to leave a message on your discussion page but it was very confusing it was different than the last guy i talked to. anyway if you see this the criteria that fits is that it is on a reputable indie label with reputable artists. john jared bowes a.k.a maybe me has been published in reputable magazines. and both ultra sonic edukators and the billions have been played on any national radio station...i put a link to one of the national radio stations that the ultra sonic edukators are currently on rotation on. there is more stuff that i could dig up...but i feel i have already qualified by the criteria that is given on here. john jared bowes is a very confusing guy thats why his article is confusing...also if get bored...check out my blog and click on satellite bowes...its pretty funny.~0

3247~departments or states? i am confused.are the departments of honduras defined geographically like the states of mexico or the lands of germany or even the states in the united states?when can one department of honduras exercise authority over another department of honduras?does the constitution of honduras subscribe to any theory of jurisdiction when it comes to organizing its departments and is the jurisdiction of one department explicitly limited by a specific border or boundary with another?if an individual or his property is taken into custody in one department is there a hearing before a magistrate as one would expect in a civil code country before he or the thing he has an interest in is extradited to another department?i think the main article could be improved by explaining when one department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular department and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority....~0

3262~is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent? dont answer the questions beyond thatwell the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here. first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean really. second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand. id is just making up their numbers. finally your example has a>b where b was deliberate design. thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown. your a>b example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him. you dont have that with life on earth. you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test. so in that sense a>b is not scientific if youve never actually observed b. btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed. so in that sense no it isnt science. ~0

3282~edits by keraunoshi keraunos. i see you added to and rearranged some of this article. i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. but actually that isnt physically accurate. the universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy. where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear i.e. the universes taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. hence i went ahead and cut this edit of yours.if people read further into the body of the article under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free. you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.i kept the ressurection link. i understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar. the term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means. you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to tipler will occur between x ^ and x ^ years from now in proper time.one should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of artificial intelligence ai as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate. hence im changing this to from that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term.i also removed your quote of tiplers estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his book the physics of immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on. so tiplers current estimation is different now. for more on that seef. j. tipler the structure of the world from pure numbers reports on progress in physics vol. no. april pp. . see also here. also released as feynmanweinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything arxiv. april . you added the section criticism from string theory.i kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. i changed the section title to implications from string theory since brian greene doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to tiplers omega point theory in greenes book that you referenced.this section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under wikipedias rule concerning original research. as its written its a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction. you moved the see also section to underneath the references. you also added a number of links therein.based upon wikipedias featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously before the references. hence i moved it back. i removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce~0

3294~ the journal of the society for psychical research has been published continuously since promoting the societys aim of examining without prejudice or prepossession and in a scientific spirit those faculties of man real or supposed which appear to be inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis. the journals contents reflect the wide range of our contributors specialisms and interests and include reports of current laboratory and fieldwork research as well as theoretical methodological and historical papers with a bearing on the field of parapsychology. quoted from the spr website all papers submitted to the journal are strictly peerreviewed. so your accusation is not based on any facts goblin face. obviously the ip address you cite is different from this jamenta ip address so again you are coming up with a very spurious and inauthentic accusation here. i prefer to remain anonymous as you have for obvious reasons not the least of which is false accusation and libel.~0

3367~it should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including muay thaiwhich mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper bodyboxing as it is calledand many other martial art techniques not exclusive to maui boran or maui tha etc... women are not considered true martial artists anyway. that is because the arts are designed used mastered and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. a womans training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. this is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. it is sad what has happened to karate and tkd in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practionersby way of parents unconditioned elders and women. but that is another debate. regardless female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. like it or not gender is of the physical mental and in my opinion the spiritual as well. play to its strengths not its weaknesses. it is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.~0

3390~responses i was not referring to this only your posts on wikipediocracy recently. i was not referring to these events dating back to it does not appear relevant to your actions now. i am sure people can refer to the arbcom case for the facts if they wish. i did review the situation with a sitting arbcom member before starting rfa as you are aware. this is the first time i have heard about it. it seems a bit late to be digging this up now. i know nothing about this your page was not even on my watchlist until today. no i was not even aware of revenge nominations. if i ever commented in a dr related to this it was not as part of any pattern and i do not recall ever doing so. i do not watch everything you do on commons nor did i watch everything russavia did. i am not russavia nor do i take responsibility for his actions. if you wish to have my help on commons please leave me a note there. i briefly looked at s contributions to assess if he was active as an otrs volunteer on commons. the copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes shocking for an otrs volunteer granting verification tickets to images. this was selfevident even looking at the first thumbnails some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review it is not like i was deleting them on sight i am leaving the review to others. if you wish to discuss ktrs uploads to commons i suggest that happens on commons.your responses appear to avoid the central issue which is how you are now using wikipediocracy to hound me. you appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. if you have allegations to make please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then i can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.again you are digging through history some of which is years old and the most recent is now years old. it would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud most of which i have forgotten as i have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.thanks ~0
3391~im sorry you are wrong on both counts. northumbrian is a different dialect to geordie as you have said. the other dialects from the area are makem and pitmatic. northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of northumberland. i being from northumberland myself actually know what i am talking about. if you live in rural northumberland bearing in mind that the shire as northumberland is a shire county is mostly rural you would have a different dialect to someone from newcastle prudhoe or gateshead as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a geordie accent. also no serious linguist would call all these different dialects geordie. i have heard them grouped as northumbrian dialects but not geordie dialects. calling them northumbrian is correct for two reasons one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as northumbria that is northumberland durham newcastle...etc...on the other point you are mistake. england though not the whole uk can be rightly called a germanic nation. it is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say though it is connected in some ways however traditions language laws and history are england was of course founded by...you guessed it germanic tribes whether they are the predominant dna is besides the point. these tribes were the angles saxons jutes and frisians. you cant deny this as before the english kingdoms england did not exist. our language is obviously germanic though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries it is still west germanic. most of our common traditions such as yule yule itself is a germanic word derived from the norse jul are germanic the eating of a christmas ham mistletoe christmas trees yule logs...etcare all germanic. many of our laws come direct from anglosaxon and danish laws though i agree many were modified by the normans who though descended from norwegians are not culturally germanic.as for selfidentity i would say that the english identify themselves with germanic culture albeit in a subliminal way for example the fact that they use anglosaxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. they are identifying with tribes that were danish and northern german and thus germanic so on that score yes the english are a germanic people.and as you bring up dna casually then firstly i will point out that it isnt proven either way whether the anglosaxon dna is more prominent or whether the british used in this sense as preanglosaxon is. different surveys have different results and none have actually been accepted by all experts. and for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the north east of england the germanic percentage is higher than the british thus the predominant dna is germanic the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is anglosaxon or danish viking blood but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is germanic. i dont care whether the modern english have british or anglosaxon blood as i am partly norsegaelic and partly english...thus being a mix. i just do think that the anglosaxon blood is prominent as do many experts in north eastern england.either way germanic blood or british blood...the english are ethnically germanic.note i am not going to lie and say i am not proud of germanic culture as it is obvious especially by my username but i do consider myself british as the uk isnt about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and i am proud of that also. and by the way there is a good case for northumbria being one of the more germanic parts due in a large part to its folklore especially its creatures that include dvergar which they are actually called...they are dwarves and álfar or more correctly ælfe as they are in old english who are known by the common english word elf but are the older and if i may say more correct type. ~0

3398~speedy deletion of phi rho eta a tag has been placed on phi rho eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. for legal reasons we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material and as a consequence your addition will most likely be deleted. you may use external websites as a source of information but not as a source of sentences. this part is crucial say it in your own words.if the external website belongs to you and you want to allow wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement i name am the author of this article article name and i release its content under the terms of the gnu free documentation license version . and later. you might want to look at wikipedias policies and guidelines for more details or ask a question here. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ~0

3421~no i will make sure that will be removed permanently. i will not do this for awhile to avoid violations but hope that someone else will consider and agree. there is no reason whatsoever to put the late in front of his name i will list several reasons and although i think that is somewhat pov there are other reason as to why i remove the infoeveryone dies sometime does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put the late in front of everyone that has died?poor writing its just sloppy/filler writing to put the late in place. would you ever see anyone referred to as the late in a print encyclopedia?recentism wp has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective. would it make sense years down the road to still refer to him as the late? lets make things as static as possible.precedent at one point several dozen articles referred to steve irwin as the late steve irwin now this is the only one that does by doing a search and there seems to be consensus about that.knowledge of his death lets face it a vast majority of people especially those that would look for this article know he is dead and the few that may not be sure can click the link. maybe people dont want to know that hes dead or be reminded of it and putting that acts as a spoiler. even anna nicole smith had a few the lates put on pages of hers and those have all been removed a few by me a few by others. saving a click is not a valid reason for this we should assume that the readers are smart and things like that can go to the simple english edition.irrelevance why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming? his shows will probably be reran for many years to come and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.well this is my case i would also like to point out wpown which i feel has been violated in these reverts. i also am starting a discussion on wpwords to avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that i am doing the right thing. i am supremely confident that i am and i look forward to improving the peta article in the future. ~0

3442~ok obiwan. youre starting to make me suspicious. what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions? own up. either way you did not answer my question directly and i also suspect you know it. does this mean that wpo is not useful to you? but you did answer it indirectly. so you get an even more direct question in return why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? for one you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. if you dont mind im going to take this straight to the source wpo peeps what the dealio? ive asked people on wp to put up or shut up. ive asked the wmf to walk their talk. in fact ive staked my rep several times now and im not done yet. now im asking you why dont you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? onwiki or off obiwan certainly isnt the first to question your selfrighteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia. i for one have been wondering for a while now. so lets see what you can do besides making snarky personal comments. heres a pot and heres a kettle. need i mention what color they are?onwards with obiwans points. i dont believe in nasty people. deciding anyone is bad nasty etc. has only one purpose one can feel better about being bad nasty etc. to people theyve so judged. i dont think this is particularly productive. in fact imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides or more often others have convinced them that they themselves are bad people. we could talk about this more in another thread but weve got to get back on topic here so. . . you know that the wikipediocrats are smart. you have spent more time there than youre willing to admit directly. i immediately wonder if its just in reading or in writing too. they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoningwise that ive met so far. but emotionally. . . less than average. how do you think many of these smart mer fers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? a lot of them fell from grace not because they werent an asset to the community but because they didnt seem to know when or they were completely unwilling to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. thats one part of the answer many of them are banned or blocked whether rightly so or not from editing on wikipedia. also its normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. youll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. frankly we could speculate about these peoples motives and methods til the sun goes down. lets be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here. what we as a wikipedia community cant do is ignore them away. and even if we could were doing a pisspoor job of it because i almost always hear about whats been said on wikipediocracy from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site. ultimately i go back to my old standard i dont give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are alls i know is that they are saying something interesting and i appreciate the fact that i dont have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it. obiwan no use playing coy. you know exactly what im talking about. d ~0

3452~==street gang==mr. davisthanks for your note on my talk page i really appreciate it and its an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book. as this articles creator and main editor im sorry that you thought the review section was so negative. please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book. in my rush to get the article published i did a google search and those are the reviews i found. also please understand that this is a wikipedia article and the article as it now stands will never be complete. its a work in progress. i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there. i am by no means a professional writer so im certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors. i wouldve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work. i appreciate your feedback something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor. if you are aware of other sources that i wasnt able to locate please send them my way on my talk page. ill repeat this message via your webpage to ensure that you see it.you should also know that ive taken it upon myself to improve all sesame streetrelated articles on wikipedia. its a big project and a great need. for example sesame street at one point was actually a featured article but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons. its an unfortunate state at the current time. your book came out shortly after i took on the project so its been a boom for me. i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start so your book has been a valuable resource. ive already started working on this article history of sesame street and if you look at the reference section youll see that ive used your book extensively. its also a work in progess and no where near finished. my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame streets th anniversary in november. i cant tell you how much your book has helped me.on a personal level i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book. it was a fun read and immensely interesting. i was brought to tears many times especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air. see im turning this year which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it. i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized they did all that for me i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly and now the life of my own children who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do. i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia and ive taken it upon myself to help accomplish that. if you as the ultimate expert could assist me in that goal i cant tell you how valuable that would be. again thanks for the feedback and communication. ~0

3508~ may utcprince felix of schwarzenburg is at the right location. his uncle and then his cousin was the fürst while felixs position all of his life was that of a prinz this distinction is tougher for families where all used fürst like wrede and also titles like herzog and graf but it is easily determined. i am as certain as you are about alfred iii because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals other than the heinrichs reuss were the heads of houses and families. friedrich johannes jacob celestin von schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway he was zu not von. he was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also the prince john adolph ii. i dont mind leaving the german von or zu for princes of territories if the title isnt used. for instance felix zu schwarzenburg and prince felix of schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. adolph von auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source i have gives adolphs title as fürst which wouldnt make sense. i would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. prince karl of auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the fürst but again i would ask on the page. charles ~0

3529~ the first reference is a dead link your second and third references use a different name than the current title. which means i count zero sites using your suggested name. you may well be right but im not about to make a change to a name and call it uncontroversial when i havent yet seen a single example. as i said before and youve simply added confirmation the seem to be several variations of the spelling of the station name. thats a good reason for posing a question in getting feedback on an article talk page. this page isnt the right place to carry out that discussion. if you are convinced that i miss reading this and think it is still uncontroversial go ahead and reinstate the template with the desired move and perhaps someone else will take care of it.talk ~0

3611~comment hi there in spite all my effort i don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the english version of the article about alexander voytovych. therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. i’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. wikipedia says “sources may encompass published works in all forms and media and in any language. the art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press ukrainian media academic institutions as well as poets writers and publications use his paintings drawings to illustrate books. the artist takes a part in a busy art life in the ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions art projects. having said that i see that there is no enough evidence for one????? tabbodnar o./боднар о. — л. тайнавтілення. — ужгород карпати . — с. —. — fоtо с. tabgavrosh a./гаврош о. тілолучниці. — л.піраміда . — с. — ілюстрації о.войтович. isbn tabdidyk n./дідик н. fundamentals of composition. — ужгород мистецькалінія . — с.. isbn tabkosmolinska n./космолінська н. art chat on green sofa // fine art. — . — № . — с. — . tabchervatiuk l./черватюк л. womens image in the ukrainian modern art. — к.навчальнакнига . — c. — tabshumylovych b./шумилович б. women paintings and allegories in high heels. // образотворчемистецтво. — . — № . — с. — . if one convinced that the article has to be deleted than do not hesitate to do so but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. what is the difference between the article about alexander voytovych and for example the herb roe’s article why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? i must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page one awards us with thenoticeboards. regarding selfpromotion which was mentioned a few times i’d like to make it clear the artists is a ukrainian and naturally all sources are ukrainian and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. the ukrainian and russian versions of wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it which says a lot.i had in my mind to present more ukrainian artist however having such an experience i’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. thanks for cooperation. from my point of view this discussion is exceeded feel free to delete the article ~0
3612~i agree with and commend all of that except for the phrase not symbols. the clear truth of the matter is that most of us east or west who are cognizant of modern history and the use of symbols herein would run a mile before agreeing to the use of swastikas/fylfots for our favorite social movement. the politically restrained people of contemporary china are somewhat in the unfortunate position indicated by the old saw beggars cant be choosers.~0

3644~ tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and u.s. jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. i appreciate that the situation in the u.s. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech. to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city. in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas. saying that dla has has offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china ... would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research. i do accept that dla with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible. ~0

3652~bagration attribution ==hello. i have reverted your edit to operation bagration again. the point is not whether zaloga got his numbers from krivosheev or not which doesnt seem to be the case given the large discrepancy in the numbers. the point is you cannot attribute a claim to a particular author and then cite the claim to another. if you attribute a claim to one author you must cite the appropriate work by that author. if you want to include krivosheevs figures then add a sentence along the lines of g. f. krivosheev however places the soviet losses much higher at killed... moreover you cant just remove a valid source because you think its wrong. all information by reliable historians should be cited especially if there is disagreement on a particular issue which appears to be the case here. == ~0

3658~the edit you pointed out as a supposed example of povpushing was not povpushing at all. i removed a reference to steve stockman running in the republican primary against john cornyn. i removed it because there were two other references to stockmans primary challenge to cornyn already in the article. also in the next edit that i did i added a better reference for the primary run. i was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the cornyn article in the first place. see if it baldfaced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble. you are a pov warrior in the first order. you attempt to slander people that dont agree with your editingjust like you are attempting to do here to me. you have zero evidence for allegationsjust made up baldfaced lies. i am not in seattle and i am a sock of either of those people. i am not a sock of anyone. you edit in bad faith and the way that you have been treating me in an example of your bad faith editing. i dont have anything to be concerned about in relation to your sock allegation. ive known that all along. i said it before you did. i did not need you to tell me. your apologies are out right lies also because when you apologize you come up with five or six more allegations against whomever you are apologizing to. all of your apologies are fraudulent just like your sock allegations. please just stop responding to me because youre fake apologies just embarrass you further and make you look worst. stop it. go away.~0

3661~a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies phylogenies i.e. dictomously branching processes are processes that involve things that is objects and as such have to be modeled by objectoriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria. now as an objectoriented model the model actually represents two consecutive objects i.e. two objects in a row by each of its internal lines i.e. lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node the former belonging to the category i.e. concept objects after nodes and the latter to the category objects before nodes. if the model includes all objects of a certain category then both of these make up this category. in summary phylogenies consist of two categories i.e. concepts of objects objects before nodes and objects after nodes and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category then these two categories make up this category.cladistics or cladism as i prefer to call it confuses the concept objects after nodes with the concept objects before nodes by defining lines between nodes as single things thereby confusing category with object that is kind with thing thus confusing conceptualization itself. the approach is actually a return to a prescientific stage this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. if this approach could ever be proved to be correct then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. luckily einsteins discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach i.e. claim and this it did even before the approach was born. cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged. consist presently at ... ~0

3681~ npov dispute just so this isnt lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article. in my interpretation the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrases usage and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. also generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov. the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version we should go through the diff line by line. did someone ever justify those massive changes? though some of them were good. t ~0

3685~changes to this page open discussion ==since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a démenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris. i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors. i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page. i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there. this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved.the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page. the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window. the same for paris history or paris fashion. here i am but repeating what i have already written below.in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages. my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own. this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity. my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own. just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have. with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt. in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary. please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all. addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here > please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out== ~0

3687~ mediawikiduplicatedefaultsort do you realize what a wonderful thing this is? when you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created? i hope not because i have been although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under s and t while i finish l and do m through r i will not complain.when i stumbled across the category there were pages in it. by the end of today there will be fewer than . my goal is to get all the nontrivial items resolved by the end of next week so i can start on the pages in categorybiography articles without listas parameter a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life. because i am resolving the conflicts in the first category i have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks like you who know why the banners work as they do. i have also leaned what items can set the defaultsort. as an added bonus i have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts i did not know before and i have become almost addicted to preview.the absolutely best part about the dupds is that the category it has created that i will continue to monitor on a daily basis is a safety net for me when i mess something up on a page in categorybiography articles without listas parameter. the easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it wants it and will throw a fit if it is not there.thank you ~0

3728~ suggestions to improve readability hi guys the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read at least thats what i read in the reader comments. i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing. before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money explain the intent of the system missing right now. sthg like it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party that can dictate credit worthiness or price of transactions as in banks or paypal etc.then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description ive read is when a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. bitcoin miners scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger. by morgen peck in ieee spectrum feb a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. another faq from a washington post blog is here and an article days ago about the death of the mt. gox bitcoin exchange by morgen peck was on science friday today is herebitcoin was also discussed on point last november in conjunction with the senate committee hearing about it. ~0

3744~midwest accenti see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the general american accent in the article midwest which quite wrongly implies that general american is owned lock stock and barrel by that region. its nonsense. the general american accent is spoken all over the north from seattle to connecticut. you are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the midwest before ikk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. it certainly is not unique to the midwest a region which was not even settled by english speakers until barely years ago after the northern accent was known to exist in places like pennsylvania and upstate ny and connecticut. it really bugs me to see the midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the northeast. the original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. anybody from my region the syracuse ny area formerly albany ny knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the midwest. i challange anybody to put a group of midwestern speakers sidebyside with upstate new yorkers and tell which is which. its impossible its the same accent utterly and completely the same. and weve been speaking this way since before the midwest was even settled so its nonsense to say its a midwest accent.~0

3819~ utcas a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers. swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here. i can well understand how fennoswedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin. august ~0
3820~ hie dvdm. i was writing what follows while you made your edit. i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example.thanks johnuniq for your advice and input. concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s early s. adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats. but thats not the really important issue here. the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there. btw in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out. at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved. there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for. cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place. throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute. so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length. ~0
3821~i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth’s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. i think that the img reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty. i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teethbut bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article. i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by offriorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth’s biography. perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which i suspect should not be difficult—that it can be reincluded? i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment. actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle. ~0

3846~to cool hand luke i ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. from the wikipedia deletion guidelinesdeletion process main article wikipediadeletion policydeletion of articles from wikipedia occurs through one of three processes. . another quick method is the use of proposed deletion simply add to the top of the article. this is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. a proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the tag within five days and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full afd process is required.i thought i complied with this policy it seems to say that any user can contest the proposal by removing the tag. it seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. beyond meeting the criterias specifics the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.i believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of wikipedia and that the proposal to delete along with the reasons given which i believe are not in good faith therefore violates various wikipedia policies.the evidence for this belief includes the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion the users prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of as demonstrated by his reasons or comments to the subject of the article proposed for deletion the fact that i have worked on this article in the past the fact that this user on or about the same day and time in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me proposed two other articles that i have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before i or anyone else had a chance to object wikipedia is not a full time job for most users who only visit the site from time to time and note also the stated policy that there are no emergencies on wikipedia the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass redirected the article to another article effectively deleting the original article. in fact the redirect was effect as i was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay and when i hit save the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost he gave me three rapid succession warnings in bad faith for what i believe were good faith acts on my part and had me blocked before i could make a response to his warnings it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.it seems quite clear in light of the above and further facts that can be marshalled in support that this users intent is not supported by facts or policies not in good faith in retaliation and therefore in violation of wikipedia policy.recognizing this i communicated to this user that i would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement by not making any further comment on the talk page of tort reform. i had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not as the user had made the dispute personal.as for my being blocked by you as per the revert rule i must point out that i do not believe the rule applies to what i did because i was making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a users his apparent violations rather than reply he deleted the warnings and requests to stop did so more than three times in violation of the rule in bad faith turned the rule on mei did not delete anything and technically i did not revert anything either i think but was adding to previous posts and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a new post.other indications of bad faiththe user asserts that i committed vandalism to the entry on sonics rendezvous band by removing the delete tags. my reply is i did so in accordance with policy it is not vandalism to remove~0

3872~well to respond to your question directly i would mention editorial commentary .. are rarely reliable for statements of fact. or the reporting of rumors has a limited encyclopedic value. but be it that or be it mentioning wpbiased was here more for the form i have never really understood the foundation of this being here. my question therefore would be why are you opposing the correction of an unsourced unsigned and incorrect as per its own definition piece of information? it can not even be referred to as a controversy since it is absolutely not a state of prolonged public dispute or debate... so what is the reason you would find this is a correct encyclopedic information?~0
3873~ new image problems you again uploaded several images with dubious copyright claims. you said they were from hindu newspaper and licensed under the gfdl. what made you think the hindu publishes images under the gfdl? if you simply invented that license in order to have a way to upload the images here then please say so now so i can quickly delete them. if not i expect you will provide proof within the next days showing where and how that newspaper placed the images under that license. if you do neither you will be blocked. ☼ ~0

3908~regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada my reading of his csr transcript is exactly the opposite. he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five stolen? canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan.regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to khaldan for years? i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team. but if the camp had been a college i think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer. a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted. az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training. and once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones. he had helped grads slip into bosnia during the civil war there. i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp. his location was a secret for four years. he was found in a libyan prinson in april by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him. and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide. i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version his pretorture versions of what the camp did.~0

3911~your source states about the black–white difference in iq which at the time was about points the neisser et al. article stated there is not much direct evidence on this point but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis. that conclusion stands today there has been no new direct evidence on the question. see rushton jensen a b gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black–white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.please stop lying. ... then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no. do you see the problem here? ... question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view? the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars. yes. ... question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist? the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology. the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article. no. nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having virtually no chance of being true by a reliable tertiary source. ... ~0

3960~you know what forget it. the guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why except of course to start shouting has reported me for not being civil. how ironic is that. rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better ill simply point out that in the current version even after you read the entire first paragraph you still dont have a clue why this article exists. you do find out what marco rodríguez does for a living though. so yay for that. i guess once you get to the end you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal but thats assuming you havent fallen asleep or shot yourself having read the same four words brazil germany biggest loss and their million variants multiple times. seriously if people here think whats currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. its not quite garbage but its not good. and please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are unencyclopedic frankly you couldnt be more wrong. theres no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match both now and in years time. if you dont want it to be in this one please think of a better reason than unencyclopedic if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.that said on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article heres what the opening should look like if youre trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.brazil – germany was the shock result of the first semifinal of the fifa world cup mens international football tournament played on july at the estádio mineirão in belo horizonte brazil. it broke brazils match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to and equalled their biggest margin of defeat tied with a – loss to uruguay in leading it to be described as a national humiliation. the game also saw germany score the most goals in world cup history their overtaking brazils . their second goal meant germanys miroslav klose reached world cup goals overtaking brazils ronaldo as the tournaments alltime record goalscorer. the game was subsequently referred to by the press as the mineirazo evoking the spirit of the maracanazo in which brazil unexpectedly lost the fifa world cup on home soil to uruguay.~0

3969~bi you said you wanted to talkat the bottom of the lead section you have writtenits promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials.regarding in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materialsthat statement appears to come from ref on page . the full quote isif the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payloadthen that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringlyfeasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible inthe near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higheroperational temperatures.it then goes on to sayas we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastoltethers needed. the primary message we want to leave with the reader is“we dont need magic materials like ‘buckminsterfullercarbonnanotubes’ to makethe space tether facility for a hastol system. existing materials will do.”so it would appear that you misread your reference. the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem. systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials.to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report statesthe fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept istechnically feasible. we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that willallow hypersonic airbreathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning spacetether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth intoearth orbit. for more than one hastol architecture concept we have developed a designsolution using existing or nearterm technologies. we expect that a number of the otherhastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected todetailed design studies. the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drasticallyreducing the cost of earthtoorbit space access.regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general the nonspinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts..the full quote ishyperskyhookin zubrin proposed the “hypersonic skyhook” as a solution to the mismatch betweenthe attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers.since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu~0

3988~cairi noticed your comment on another users talk page who in turn spoke to me. please do not encourage povdriven participation and do not make unfounded allegations of povbias. please take note of wpagf wpnpov and wprs. information in an article which can potentially be called slander if unfounded needs to be supported with highly credible sources. too much of the information youve readded are unsourced others are supported by sources that dont speak to the content youre adding. do not use content from sources and then draw your own interpretations of what they mean. also bear in mind that sources that come from editorials or opinion pieces need to be represented in the article as opinions not relayed as fact. this is particularly the case when the source has a clearly partisan allegience.~0

3995~ no moar dramah tom morris i wanted to commend you for your post on the wpnpov wp administrators noticeboard. adding to the motivation for that discussion i have to wonder about your motivation for getting on your wpsoap soapbox making your statement this might lead one to think that didymus judas thomas is a paid advocate working for burzynski. or not. youre entitled to your opinion but your opinion is not based on facts but just your inaccurate speculation. i would suggest that if you have to put or not after it it probably was not worth bringing up in the first place because wp doesnt need moar dramah no i didnt mumble when i typed that. thank you very much. didymus judas thomas //~0
3996~no wikipediaconsensus says “consensus is typically reached as a natural product of the editing process generally someone makes a change or addition to a page and then everyone who reads the page has an opportunity to either leave the page as it is or change it.” therefore there was nothing wrong with me editing. chuck marean~0
