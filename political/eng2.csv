2002,2002,there is no such clear consensus and as is also clearly stated this process is not a vote but an unbiased consideration of arguments. the notice at the top of the deletion page clearly invites anyone to contribute yet you say their arguments should not be counted because they are single user accounts? from your statements you are clearly under the impression that this is a voting process and i suspect you did not even trouble yourself to consider the arguments involved also given your reluctance to provide a short report on the matter. yes i have now filed such a deletion request.,0

2029,2029,undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. see archive . the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign . hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. the relationship if one can call it that between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright. many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but obamawrighttucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life. if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article. there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also. picking out just hagee to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight. this article is about mccains whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant. if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about mccains campaign which has a couple paragraphs about hagee. in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut. right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on mccainfeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s as compared to more about hagee.,0

2035,2035,alex thank you for your reply.i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion.regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat. that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later. there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page.the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland. it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion. and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine. note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep. i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system. 連絡 見学/迷惑 ,0
2036,2036,i found a better reference.in page theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women. of these only the first is common.and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous and per cent for monogamous unions.the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either. this had been sitting on the shelf for over years deep in the recesses of the basement. murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.,0

2086,2086,further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede . since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards. sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it. ,0

2107,2107,kenneth tennysons reckless behavior in other forums==as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors here is an exerpt from a book review on founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement never studied under a legitimate teacher or any martial art teacher never set foot in asia completely disproven shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson et al. was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and ill enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what exstudents say at him a propaganda liemaster. the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsportwhile putting others down kenny brags or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare peoplehmmm... well kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera alot of jumping and posturing and a lot of religious themes to it. i guess it depends on what martial arts youve trained in to determine whether i can kick a$$ or not. lets see... im a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. ive got to start learning about grappling though. freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist. here are some excerpts from users from other forumsthe armchair analyst asia times forumi see. however you sounded like a racist.no i have no south asian sensitivities. i am no nationalist/jingoist. i consider myself above it all. all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness. it may be in a narrow anglosaxon way but not in a gandhibuddha sort of a way. get it?civilizations such as india actually even china until today have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.you have generalized indians to be bigots etc. i agree that some not all are. but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist. yes it does rocky asia times forumwhat inaccuracy are you referring to? if brits came to india and got rich was the wealth indian or british? besides looting what exactly did british accomplish? while your bias is clearly visible with this statement what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?isnt it quiet evident that even in yr it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass why on earth would anything written by anglosaxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? thats just a couple of the many others. however i do not want to clog up this page.i have also noticed that kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites i know that i am not the only one who knows thisbrahman martial arts planet forumi really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning. bliss asia times forumthats not from a social studies journal you fraud thats a copy paste... rocky asia times forumi believe kenneth probably picked up a website of some tourist board,0

2111,2111,hmmm. i was actually writing a response as you sent yours. oh well. for the record my response was thisresurrecting articles is frowned upon yes. we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change to...the game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article.making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders. certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start. i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article i.e. not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works. if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan. i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same. i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though. the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as – manchester city f.c. season/spurs city or however the subpage is actually named given the / in the name.yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category. i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic. better to do it ourselves i guess.sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and...well better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed. hopefully i addressed all your points. ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak. having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in. generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy. yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play. to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup? in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it. talk ,0

2139,2139, july utcalthough i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine. i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so. not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles. nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles. however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now. at some point however i will source his/her statements as soon as i find time to delve into the texts just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you. until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this. the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth. but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail. from wikipedia re. abbey road being the final album or notabbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles. although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded. ...after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days. .. just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album. martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be. in their interviews for the beatles anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note.re. the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road but it is followed by her majesty. in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on july her majesty followed mean mr. mustard......etc. this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people. ,0

2148,2148,at bat edit warring at matt joyce baseball juan encarnación terry tiffee ian kinsler craig breslow matt guerrier etc.==please dont change at bat to atbat. atbat just redirects right back to at bat anyway. i agree. i agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated. in addition pls stop edit warring at matt joyce baseball ian kinsler craig breslow etc. and add to the list matt guerrier. it is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record. there is no reason to delete it other than your penchant for disruptive edits. kindly desist. it has also been explained to you with proper citations that the plural of rbi is rbis. pls stop edit warring this point. see juan encarnación and terry tiffee. that is vandalism. run batted in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis. obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info.its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  t / c danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap. both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler either make it a subhed or take it off seriously.oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky. in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in. rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint.either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. jackal again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch. as to rbis as xlee pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseball/archiverbis. plus is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention. yet jackals reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s as though the s is incorrect. he has done the same with at bat which he insists must be hyphenated. etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits. it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits. if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits. there is enough good work he could perform instead. well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do . as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one. regarding what uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue. in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists. allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked. jargon overrides grammar. to say that a batter flied out is probably not good grammar either but its proper baseball terminology. i think this needs to be discussed at the project page assuming anyones watching that page anymore. userbaseball,0

2152,2152, legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. the source reads the european union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. lets have a look at the law itself. framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences ... public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group. in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case. whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal. as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredis the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court? ,0

2234,2234,matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title. witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics ashkenazi hebrew cantonese linguistics american english sephardi hebrew etc etc... arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or arvanitika language are out of the question. i dont want to use arvanitika albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title. therefore the only options are arvanitic or arvanitika. they can and should be used. arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used. what is wrong with it? it is neutral. it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica etc aree wrong. macedonian and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect. if britannica or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such. no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. why should they be treated as such. every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title. arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies. what unesco britannica etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor. i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will. are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english? no so stop that straw man argument. arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy. the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia. we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them. regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies? that is what you are asking me to do,0

2298,2298, utcas a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers. swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here. i can well understand how fennoswedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin. august ,0

2329,2329,hello deacon thanks for the kind words. your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar? but theres no great preference here either way.oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the th century ... have a look at the skene reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way.it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony. northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly mercia and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones. im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons.the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article. regards ,0

2332,2332,troublesome sentencepaleolithic europeans seem to have been a homogenous population possibly due to a population bottleneck or nearextinction event on the iberian peninsula where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation and then expanded into europe during the mesolithic periodthis is false. i cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that palaeolithic europe was genetically homogeneous. if there is one it would require inline citation. i think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. the studies have rather shown that mesolithic europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. the bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.,0

2376,2376, im not even sure what you mean when you stated just trying to help make you piece sound better. do you mean your piece? if so this isnt my piece. its an article written from the contribution of many editors. i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify. secondly you didnt just change a phrase. you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting. if you read the entire sentence its somewhat redundant to add that. and finally theres nothing unprofessional about the term railroad. in fact its actually a better fit. if you look up the definition for railway youll find that its often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances. we have no idea if thats true or not and therefore railroad is actually preferred. ,0

2394,2394, european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not .as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version. now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable. i contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she thinks it is the most neutral one. i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the eu. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included. i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages. ,0

2402,2402,a poor start sorry. the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. first of all no common twonations table is possible patent nonsense. second i object the followingthe passage from the russian table speaking of the kievan rus. as someone suggested earlier that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between kievan rus and modern russia. this is the main disputed claim commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian usersregardless of any ukrainian military table none of them may include the red army. this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states with very formal postwwii exception but also significantly antiukrainian. for instance red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and antisoviet guerillas. creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users. for instance see earlier alexpus passage on trading the truthgiven all that id suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising. i thank you an innocent editor for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue. ,0
2403,2403,an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the passover holiday. the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover according to tradition.some jews currently live in iran. the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years. while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. so seems to be the way to go. ,0

2420,2420, more description of location please? hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is? i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful. i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. what do you think? any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful. i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you. thanks and best wishes ,0

2436,2436,changes to this page open discussion ==since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a démenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris. i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors. i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page. i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there. this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved.the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page. the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window. the same for paris history or paris fashion. here i am but repeating what i have already written below.in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages. my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own. this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity. my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own. just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have. with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt. in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary. please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all. addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here > please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out== ,0

2451,2451,official christian death ® this page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish which simply need changing and then leaving alone.i have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which i wish to place on here knowing full well that minutes later the fools that wish to write things they know little about or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become cd will desperately alter the content. the article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts. people that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them. but the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow. rd party discussion regarding valor or rozz should be eliminated in favour of the christian death biography.message me at to have discussion about page.article i propose is thus text only i will alter the page to format correctly and alter the main page add feedback to this after my discussion in thread called editing talkchristian death® comment not inside this.christian deathbiographydiscography in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth. then christian death turned it upside down.historyofficially there have been over musicians involved with the band. therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.formed in los angeles and fronted by year old vocalist/lyricist rozz williams the band released the first album “only theatre of pain in . a dark sinister style of punk rock. the album gained local success. a year later the band completely broke upsinger rozz then joined the band “pompeii founded by singer guitarist song writer valor.rozz took over vocals leaving valor to focus on guitar. before rozz joined pompeii the band had already released their fist album “look at yourself” to much acclaim which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. the pompeii had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their french record company to merge pompeii into a new version of christian death which after some debate was agreed upon. thus began the new christian death and the first pompeii tour became the first christian death tour.part way through the tour the band stopped in wales to record songs some of which were originally intended for the next pompeii album. the fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “catastrophe ballet”.like the first pompeii album catastrophe ballet had an apocalyptic theme however the music morphed into something not quite pompeii and nothing like the first christian death album. after the tour the band returned to la to later record the rd christian death album”ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. after confirming the nd tour in singer rozz quit the band. valor returned to vocals the band embarked on the nd tour. in italy the band recorded the mini album “the wind kissed pictures” a surrealist view of a mystical past. almost immediately work began on the th full length album “atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of world war ii and the connection to future shock waves. while continuously touring in the band released the th and now classic album “the scriptures” the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today. brought us the release of “sex drugs jesus christ”. this was turning point for the band. the cover depicted an image of jesus shooting up heroin. this was a full frontal attack by valor against the church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized christianity. the band then found themselves confronted by protesters riots and bomb threats these events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of nine inch nails korn marilyn manson type o negative every goth band on the planet and many others. saw the release of the double album epic “all the love all the hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death day and night man and woman black and white.in came the release of “insanus ultio proditio misericordiaque” with its theme of an ancient dream state.late in after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting christian death rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in los angels under the name christian death. on the same day christian death was in europe performing in paris france. assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash as explained to valor,0

2470,2470,the very long discussion over st wpscn project talk page i have read a lot of the wpscn pages and the very few have neutrality tags. some have or tags but the majority seem to be npov. so why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three scientologists from what i can make out have scanned all three user pages and a lot of comments are unsigned about how the project is biased against elron? would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging npov possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out nonnpov statements on the talk pages of those articles? after all xenu is fa status so the npov cannot be too far off. as for unsigned the comment you left after my first post was unsigned and there were a couple of more during the discussion.,0

2478,2478,nor have i made a legal threat. first i am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the blm protest. i have never known any of these people. i would not be the offended party in any case. ive never even lived in minnesota or been there in over years or so. i made an airplane connection through minneapolis in about as i vaguely recall. i am not saying there will be any sort of legal proceeding i am merely saying that to cite this claim heard the nword risks running afoul of being libel. i think wp rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody heard the nword is problematic from a wpblp standpoint. if multiple blm protestors claim that they heard one of the white visitors say the nword and it was cited from some reliable source that would probably change my opinion. can you see why this would be a different situation? ,0

2482,2482,im in twothree minds over this proposal. as regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic ive seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a wprs is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards. on the third hand we do get some nohopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as nonnotable. in the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking thats why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as i can tell. andemu ,0

2492,2492,parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know betterdear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing. she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it. i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section. she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike. not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you.to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in. then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version. is that soapboxing??to use another example closer to home. lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail? like he clearly said here under the desperate? heading heeeeelp. and then he also bizarrely? asks gregalton help him delete references to like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism? can you believe it? i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this. the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll. he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. it made me realize that were going around in circles. we improve the articles to the point that they look great. then they get screwed up again. so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery? it could help people who arent educated...the idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his. the guy is mad. if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation. then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing. zenwhat is clearly a piece of work. check out the dudes talk page. in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana. so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking. what a comboseeing this i ponder my options. i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better? versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions. for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the eight? people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page. it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing. is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines? this is like watching evolution in reverse. i carefully construct a page with the help of others. it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos?. instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0

2517,2517,verbal your pov is showing. i didnt choose the closing admin there was a neutral notice at wpan and jzg while he made a comment in the discussion wasnt involved any longer. it was not his action being reversed effectively but s and he had already recused himself. so lets find out what the actual consensus is if someone else doesnt beat me to it instead of blabbering more. ill be adding an external link and well see what happens. note that we already have an external link to lenr in martin fleischmann and that was heavily reviewed. we should have many more here as convenience links if nothing else. same wiht net.,0

2528,2528,frankly this is a waste of everybodys time. it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again full in the knowledge that you will not accept them. your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole. you have consistently failed to assume good faith and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article. you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was. yet you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy. we havent moved on significantly.if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us. wpucs is a guide an essay not policy. in any case common sense dictates that on controversial articles material is more likely to be challenged than on noncontroversial ones. this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us. the material has implications for npov. these are the facts that are relevant here. a long circular argument on talk helps noone. talk ,0

2561,2561,just to make the point that im not making this problem up heres the abstract of who are the canadians? changing census responses canadian ethnic studies journal spring by monica boyd doug norris at the close of the twentieth century canadian has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group up from . percent in to nearly percent in and to percent in the census of canada. from what groups did this indigenous label draw in the five years between the and the censuses? using unpublished tabulations from the and canadian censuses this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the canadianborn age in and age by . we find that most of the increases between and in canadian ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in british origin responses. between and increasing canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the british and french ethnic origin counts. in some provinces notably the prairie provinces of alberta manitoba and saskatchewan shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups. ,0

2573,2573, talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you. peter iii of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin? your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. the reasons to prefer the coin areit is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w/ a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese kingin your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. srnec the problem is that we have different criteria.you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information.i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. the two representations have the same chance of not being % accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other.if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing. but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time. i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary. do you have an argument? why are your criteria better than mine? really? when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons. but i do not want another long discussion with you. i offer consensus. would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? both of those are improvements over the thcentury image but not over the coin. at least one other editor agrees with me. sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. this discussion is already too long. both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life. either both seem right. imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. you are not allowed to impose your will. both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles. they were reviewed by several editors. stop with your edit warring. lecen is aware of the threerevert rule. are you? youve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours. you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.,0

2576,2576,regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada my reading of his csr transcript is exactly the opposite. he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five stolen? canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan.regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to khaldan for years? i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team. but if the camp had been a college i think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer. a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted. az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training. and once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones. he had helped grads slip into bosnia during the civil war there. i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp. his location was a secret for four years. he was found in a libyan prinson in april by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him. and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide. i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version his pretorture versions of what the camp did.,0
2577,2577,as i suspected complete nonsense. your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is. you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided. i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption. i am not a stupid person. i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick.you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability commentby the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.heres a few points for you to think on.wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.then lets consider the arbcom an article. what then is this articles content?hmm lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of? why members. so that means the content of the committee is its members. so an election is a decision on the content of this article.so.members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.you dont like that?wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.but arbcom is not an article. it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions.is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership? if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid? would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder? if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing? can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? the questions were politely put. they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom. they were not deferential. which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully. do not try to bully me.finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here. ,0

2694,2694,for daniel casehi daniel. the block is extremely odd. imo there is no real discussion of my activity in that an thread in connection with a siteban. jehochman whom i have some history with floated the idea of a siteban. durova who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of cirt generally badmouths me about abusive sockpuppetry etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by ryulong. i agree to it. then ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. blueboy a new admin that improperly blocked me an established editor as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom i blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. he is supported by guess who jehochman durova and athaenara whom i also have history with and whose wprfa i made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. i can provide diffs for all of this but i want to show you one thread now over at wikinews. durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin luckily takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom here. i invite a neutral admin to do the same here. i have to run now. please let me know how you would like to proceed. thanks.,0

2705,2705, i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world. you still prefer previous title i.e. united nations statistical divisions to the current one i.e. united nations geoscheme?if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones. google this statistical divisions site the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments. google this statistical divisions sitetherefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m. . un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical. i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping. natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country. i use it quiet often. it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as un geoscheme. try google book search and you will find at least the followingthe best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia. as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories....the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region ....country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification....were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme /unsd/methods/m/... that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme. in fact ...i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc. have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research. this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better. although it is not official term or a technical term un m. i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m. . moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm. of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidence/citations here before i bring it to rm. comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ,0

2717,2717, redennis browns final warning i didnt mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. i didnt violate the final warning curtisnaito did multiple times. the exact wording of the warning was if either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility bludgeons a discussion violates wpidht acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of hours. at no point did i push the boundaries of civility bludgeon a discussion violate idht act in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. curtisnaito displayed the exact same kind of idht behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions and when told explicitly that he was violating dennis browns final warning he kept doing it.your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual when nothing i had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning was an offtopic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.i understand you dont like me but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly? 聖やや ,0

2759,2759,fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in . by the name fc citizens vardar the club won championships from till . about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together. each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal. how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup. the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents. the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as republics but yet without a nation those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions . in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and vranje prvinces. these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships. in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for the ww the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league. after the ww the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in . the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s macedonian republic league was transformed in to macedonian first league. so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level. its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side. serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues. they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league. they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition. for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information. second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship.,0

2771,2771,hello barto. i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it? as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left. these are terms both i and ron himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights. i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details.however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article. i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr. gostick. the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him. this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridges document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for.i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself. i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him. i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs. there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense. an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gosticks page in case he didnt know it existed. be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later. one was a recent highlevel member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it. living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone. feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish. do you have a wiki email or a private one? ,0

2804,2804,hey. it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. you have to change this attitude on your part. your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. you guys are of course wrong. you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine. your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia. i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason. it is just plain innacurate....,0

2819,2819,first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste. one refutation is more than sufficient. second your rationales appear to be shifting. originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements. now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable. be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy. given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source. i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy. consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues. this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy. this means no specious claims. and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues. can you abide by these conditions? ,0

2832,2832,deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists. so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert/yorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environmentfrom a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two. if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy ? this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.this scenario is dennetts and to some extent everetts. since the question doesnt even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. you might conclude that this question doesnt make any sense. but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not. in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy .to give an example of actual or and synth ill go beyond dennetts example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective. for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later. what is the subjective experience? from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? boltzmanns brain is a similar idea. ,0

2855,2855,yes you got it the govt lied. see the talk page for cselr ok im lazy and not typing current page name. they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from. i have provided the link to the index of papers produced mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw so you can confirm that the business case was never provided. there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary. some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and posttfnsw publications such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are % lower.. i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about. that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language. the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions. the terms of reference open to the public to see for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this. i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past selfproclaimed senior executive of tfnsw. so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group. = link to index of docs produced for st call that is why there was the nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at. by making the nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the st call they made it public. the outcome they expected was what ended up happening.,0

2862,2862,i agree. i certainly agree that the last paragraphs should be removed as ive argued above. im agnostic on the rest but agree that a full rewrite should be undertaken by a knowledgable editor.,0
2863,2863,i disagree. the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if cameron were to die/resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt. clegg may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.,0

2870,2870,getting what specifically? so far busby has been right about most things. his detractors are from the nuclear industry. he is a recognised expert and not as far to the extreme as you claim wphonesty wpnotscandal. i am dismayed why you continue to attack this man especially when your identity is known this leaves you wide open for proceedings as busby has apparently started to do. nuclear and its radiological effect are now understood busby has significantly contributed to internal emitter debate this the central argument of second event theory. modern research has now accepted this damaging form of exposure as it was previously ignored. you could say in fact that busby was ahead of his time and received much criticism for it. ,0

2872,2872, thank you for pointing out that anne of świdnica wikipedia wiki has only hits not as many web pages mirror wikipedia content and not all pages acknowledge that. allowing the further propagation of such or terms is clearly unacceptable.when looking at google scholar anne of swidnica has at least one hit compared to none for the diacritic version or the polish name and that refers to the book medieval germany an encyclopedia already mentioned above which on page uses inconsistent naming by two different authors while elsewhere preferring schweidnitz. google scholar with hits for anna von schweidnitz shows that this is the proper name used internationally by scholars.   discuß   ,0

2888,2888, dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. this isnt a list of people who kinda sorta theres a small chance maybe are transgender.the ones who crossdressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it. the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is guan yin. the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something e.g. military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered.the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too? also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact.and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to ed wood? you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them. that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.maxwell klinger wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army. anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality. whats the association between the two?also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here. ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. june utc,0

2893,2893,==street gang==mr. davisthanks for your note on my talk page i really appreciate it and its an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book. as this articles creator and main editor im sorry that you thought the review section was so negative. please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book. in my rush to get the article published i did a google search and those are the reviews i found. also please understand that this is a wikipedia article and the article as it now stands will never be complete. its a work in progress. i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there. i am by no means a professional writer so im certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors. i wouldve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work. i appreciate your feedback something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor. if you are aware of other sources that i wasnt able to locate please send them my way on my talk page. ill repeat this message via your webpage to ensure that you see it.you should also know that ive taken it upon myself to improve all sesame streetrelated articles on wikipedia. its a big project and a great need. for example sesame street at one point was actually a featured article but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons. its an unfortunate state at the current time. your book came out shortly after i took on the project so its been a boom for me. i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start so your book has been a valuable resource. ive already started working on this article history of sesame street and if you look at the reference section youll see that ive used your book extensively. its also a work in progess and no where near finished. my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame streets th anniversary in november. i cant tell you how much your book has helped me.on a personal level i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book. it was a fun read and immensely interesting. i was brought to tears many times especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air. see im turning this year which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it. i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized they did all that for me i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly and now the life of my own children who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do. i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia and ive taken it upon myself to help accomplish that. if you as the ultimate expert could assist me in that goal i cant tell you how valuable that would be. again thanks for the feedback and communication. ,0

2900,2900,its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement. there was a recent newspiece a quote by putin times of israel putin first soviet government was mostly jewish. apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact. in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article.,0

2902,2902,you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources. this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions. brian krebs a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog krebs on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up. ... then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer ... and ... iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions ... proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics. it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided. and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company. contributions talk ,0
2903,2903,jung and einstein in albert einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in aarau switzerland. in after school in switzerland einstein renounced his german citizenship. carl p. jung was born in in the swiss canton or county of thurgau. while jung worked on wandlungen und symbole der libido psychology of the unconscious tensions grew between freud and jung. frank p. geyer continued to serve as a detective until august when he resigned. he had been transferred to the th police district in the united states. detective geyer had arrested james anderson whether this is the same anderson mentioned in detective geyers work is nondeterminable. in tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. in albert einstein acquired swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper obtaining a teaching position at school in schaffhausen switzerland. the fbi file on einstein came to light in when robert alan schwartz wrote an article on the subject for the nation magazine. between j. edgar hoover and john hutchison democratic rights didn’t stop with mccarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of socalled notorious j. edgar hoover. yet for years zeropoint energy according to hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. john hutchisons claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are like nasa. the fbi should do an article on nasa and their nondeterminable webers.i do not find it too surprising schwartz once more wrote about not only frank geyer but albert einstein with not too much said about carl p. jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.,0
2904,2904, msa garratts hithe idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error. that is understandable as the subject is complex. the wagr first imported the m class garratts in . these are very important locos because they are the third class of garratt to be built and the first main line garratt showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated. so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. both classes were built by beyerpeacock.the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops. apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.the story does not end there but moves to victoria. the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. outside framed garratts are very rare even in the smaller gauges. but wait there is more no not steak knives. the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g.so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed.personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients. some work would be required to hunt down variations though. so yes i think it does deserve an article.please feel free to use the above if you wish.cheersmichael.,0

2923,2923,controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip. in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology. in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around. so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy. mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw. i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw. rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means. i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for. however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine. the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines. the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable. agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines. the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips. just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that.what i suggest is a compromise. i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or. mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use. do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated? without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage. im thinking something like this....clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however mw defines it as such.this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated. i think this is fair. note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here. im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly. ,0

2978,2978, april utc the game is an abstract mental game the objective of which is to forget its existence. there is no point in calling the game a meme the majority of stuff on wikipedia is a meme. a meme is simply any idea or concept. i think what this refers to is a common misconception of the word meme basically meaning a fad. the game has some interesting memetic properties but these should be described elsewhere in the article if anywhere. whoever wants the meme version up should read the meme article first. ,0
2979,2979,i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteattempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape. if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader.i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do. to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal. and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway.further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists? paperclips? light bulbs?some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out.am i missing something? p.s. what do you mean about wpciv?,0
2980,2980,none beefart repliesthanks for you comments. few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles. i disagree with you about none. the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one. in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one. it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs. it has to be no one is a dinosaur. here are two examples from the oed e.j. howard except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable. p. rose people sought her... but none was a companion. however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from graham greene who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited. this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight. maybe i ought to as well . there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. e.g. none of the increase is due to.... here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing. i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase... ,0

2984,2984, the truth about the sinn féin ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party. how he broke the sinn féin constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn féin membership. and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. in section b. of the sinn féin constitution read as follows“no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. the adams leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis. its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle.b. shall not draw their salaries for personal use. parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser’s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as followsthat section b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the ard chomhairle. obviously motion infringes section b. section b. was in effect at the time this resolution was presented. its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure. he should have sought a majority decision to amend section b. in and returned in to propose entering leinster house. trying to amend section b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist county parliament” in the same resolution was a logical impossibility. can anybody say that the wording“that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle?clearly adams was in breach of section b. and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution .brian feeney in his book sinn féin turbulent years puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section b by introducing a motion in allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the sinn féin constitution. this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section b in any way. to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. in fact the line adams added in was superfluous as the sinn féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.of course its not illegal to amend or remove section b. section b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies. it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority. the reason for doing so could be many. perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic. in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason. but you,0

3017,3017, on the way forward consider this before posting here i would much prefer it if certain people did not post on this page. so before posting please consider whether you might be described as a tendentious canvasser or drama seeker mischiefmaker advocate misrepresenter someone who piles on without clue or someone carrying over by association the disputes that they have with contributors elsewhere. if you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you and if you are an admin chillum comes to mind then find another. im not keen on this because it restricts collaboration but hey people like that basically just seem to vent poke or offer weird advice when i am the subject of their attention. im human not a saint while my ability to tolerate the types described above is not bad it is also not infinite.id be pleased if the time that you would have spent here is expended instead on editing indiarelated articles. but bear in mind that you will need to be able todeal knowledgeably with touchy and repetitivelyraised issues such as hindutva religious and casterelated povpushinghandle completely clueless newbies on a large scale many of them encouraged to edit by an illconsidered wmf initiativehandle often largescale sock and meatfarms and masses of copyvio and blp violationstake copious amounts of general abuse pretty much dailyface all sorts of physical and legal threats both on and offwiki as well as reallife stalking over prolonged periods by multiple peopleall with little or no support from the wmf and large swathes of the community who are more interested in the neverending tendentious discussion of meta issues among them policy honor and the creation of a wikitopia than actually improving content where it matters most.and when you need a break from articles that relate to per cent of the worlds population and which suffer grossly from bias systemic and otherwise go chill by creating a ga or at least a bclass article more or less singlehanded. do all of this and youll make me a very happy and surprised man. do it for kish edits without getting blocked on spurious grounds or otherwise then youll be really quite remarkable.im not saying that i will be back but if i do return id rather not see stuff here from the types of people described above. thanks. ,0

3043,3043,i asked you to ensure you were accurate because if you were wrong wpspade i would accurately call you a liar. userbullrangifer made a comment that my alleged use of unreliable sources ... doesnt exactly help your credibility. however this statement was not true at all and has no basis in reality. it was fabricated simply to damage my credibility. he says this despite the fact that i had not used any unreliable sources on the page. his poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. when asked for clarification of his accusation he produces four links. of the four two were posted after his offensive comment was made. therefore i assume he was taking about the first two links that i had already provided when he said it. the first two links both of them were from of newspaper articles from the washington post . yes both of them this person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce more reliable sources that damages his credibility not mine. im calling bullshit on everything he said. for the reasons above i am calling userbullrangifer a liar. chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy. he got his lame comment in before i posted the second two links. those links were for the associated press and government of canada but lots of other reliable places have this stuff. he didnt back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. for this reason is also a liar. thats not all. this person must be the brains of this operation. right here on this page puts forth the argument that and none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory. i think his credibility was lacking prior to his comment about me. its pretty obvious that logical thinking is lacking here too. previously ive called his position the dumbest possible argument for anything ever. ,0

3131,3131,again i disagree. scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness particularly for the question of the roma and the disable. in fact as you go through modern academic literature the last years holocaust more and more includes nonjewish victims. just an example alex callinicos from york university the holocaust isfor good reasons i need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. all the different kinds of domination fused together in auschwitzracism directed at jews slavs and roma the economic exploitation of slave labour the oppression of gays and women the persecution of dissenting minorities such as communists and jehovahs witnesses. or slawomir kapralski identity building and the holocaust roma political nationalism. i have already mentioned sybil milton who was a senior historian at the research institute of the us holocaust memorial museum and henry friedlander a leading holocaust historian in the usa is another important voice. this increasing consensus has had an impact on common language as well on political bodies. see this press release from the un for instance. it is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist mordern project and the common fate of the victims. the famous pictures of mengeles twins are of roma children. the technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the t. the tactics of eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of poland against polish leaders. i have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of jews in the holocaust i have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.if this is not enough let me try in another way by deciding to describe the holocaust as an exclusive jewish event wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate i could say on the declining side of an ongoing scholarly debate. this is not holocaust denial with no legitimacy in the academia and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes. at very least wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead ,0

3201,3201, ufc afds those were never transcluded to the afd page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing. im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the afd banners from the articles ill delete the afd pages when i get the chance. i havent been able to spend much time on wikipedia lately. looks like theyve been officially listed as afds. ill leave them alone for now. jake bostwick ive only nominated a few very obvious mma people before. bostwick was deleted via afd discussion. a speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied. to me he still fails wpmmanot but im in no way a mma expert. what do you think? at first glance it appears that bostwick hasnt fought at the highest level of mma as required by wpathlete or whatever the guideline is these days and wpmmanot. if i had an interest in having the article removed i would afd it again. hello it has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. can i first point out that jake bostwick is a former ucmma middleweight champion and currently the ucmma welterweight champion? ucmma is along with bamma and cage warriors the biggest mma promotion in the united kingdom. secondly after glancing over wpmmanot and wpathlete i see that they are indeed guidelines. now i may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in afds as the sole reason why to delete any article. thirdly i have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page i have found very strong sources from websites such as the sun the mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called party wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a wheel clamper only strengthens his notability. the very sources on him alone helps him pass wpgng which is all you need to pass a page on wikipedia in my opinion.i would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion i find is a bit disrespectful towards me however i fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now i have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more. userpoundpound since you filed the spi i wanted to update you that ive reversed the block. i requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation. i had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however i fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case. i completely see why you reported it i did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here. just wanted to update you. ¢ © join wer alpha chi national honor society copyright i made changes and enhancements to the alpha chi national college honor society page including citations to sources. the director of operations contacted wikipedia granting permission for material from the website to be used by wikipedia. she received a reply indicating that it was safe to move forward with the edits. nearly a month later you removed the edits. is there something im missing here?a copy of the email sent to wikipedia and the replydear lara noahthank you for your email. our response follows your message.// lara,0

3227,3227,anyone have any thoughts on the addition of bernard lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians? since augustine aquinas are listed and lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers i thought he would be a good addition to the list. his work is wellregarded in th century philosophy he certainly has the credentials and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle augustine and aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see insight a study of human understanding. there are lonergan centers at boston college university of toronto seton hall and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. im quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable.my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so thought i would throw it out there. ,0

3230,3230,speedy deletion of indian association of special libraries and information centres a tag has been placed on indian association of special libraries and information centres requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. please see wikipediastub for our minimum information standards for short articles. also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the articles talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0

3234,3234,thanks for replying. off hand im not convinced that investigating your reply wizard and how it works would have speeded up this conversation.i checked the deletion log before querying this with you. it merely refers to criteria f invalid fair use claim without any further explanation of exactly why as you have now given.in this instance the stamp image is not used simply as an illustration where as per policy an alternative illustration for example by scanning the covers and creating a similar collage could have been created. it also makes an important contribution to the discussion of the series by demonstrating that it is sufficiently important for a stamp to have been created depicting the series as a whole. the existence of the stamp itself is noteable for a mention in the article.i note that criteria .. is not a wiki policy but merely a guideline and is stated to be one example of acceptable usage not an exhaustive list. the policy above states that usage must follow the spirit of the policy at the top of the page not the guideline list of examples.regards.,0

3239,3239,well in case anyones interested in following up on this further using the la trobe university online search engine a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ truncated to allow for various inflections leads to bjt record hits at least of which are in the pali canon. heres the first page of the search results with links to the subsequent pages as well . of course this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term nor what this term means in the context of various suttas since multiple records can be part of a single sutta. similarly this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term etc.. fwiw a quick review of these results potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words e.g. netti peta one in the abhidhammas kathavatthu once in the visuddhimagga and times in the pali histories. if nothing else this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by peter and myself might possibly be among? the core texts. with metta talk ,0

3248,3248, as daft as it sounds yes if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wptruth wpverifable wprs wpnor and wpnor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. talk contrib as it says on my talk page i prefer to have discussions all in the same place. i am watching this page so please reply here. to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here. so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either youll insist on a source for that too? seriously you are mistaken on a few points. i think you need to read wpverify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace including everything in articles lists and captions must be verifiable. all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. emphasis added jeh note the distinction. you wrote if it cant be verified it gets removed. but first the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified. not only is it part of the definition of the term the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. so no we dont need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. and second except for blp issues wpv only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. this material didnt need a source and even if it did it isnt required to remove it right away. even for claims that really should have a citation to a wprs the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template. see templatecn. this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someones edit rather than simply reverting it. i suppose you could say well since i removed it its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source. yeah fine. so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs thats already there and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. no its not much work but consider does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? was it the best use of yours? and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future? also in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices. in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to sic. well that is true but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article nor even claim that such were wrong. so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. finally i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. after reading wpverify you should probably look at wpvandalismeven if misguided willfully against consensus or disruptive any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. edit warring over content is not vandalism. careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial detrimental but wellintentioned and vandalizing. mislabelling goodfaith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wpagf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it. in sum please be careful about undoing others edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wpverify. consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material. please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism. and you should never have intentions of editwarring so the statement that you dont have any here is troubling. why would you need to state such a thing if not for the possibility that you might have s,0

3280,3280,xkcdhey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me randall munroe labeling it patently madeup information. understandable and taken in good humor of course and nothing on the page is sourced its more of a stub than anything. but im curious why you were so sure it was fabricated. xkcdi find it hard to believe that a yearold could have been working fulltime for nasa. of course you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe. schreit mich an i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated. i stayed for the better part of a year until late . nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects. its not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.anyway the information is taken from my published bio page but youre right you have no way of knowing whether im lying or not. i guess its probably safest to assume that i am.in that case ill admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place i know very little about science but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area. feel free to readd the info although the impression i got from the original version was more than you werent just a contract worker. if thats not even a valid distinction in the states its increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance. schreit mich an honestly they never really explained to me which one i was. i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots and nasa paid me through a government contractor. when i said i work for nasa no one argued. it was a lot more dilbertesque than you would expect. old echoing tile hallways with quiet gruff middleaged men working at blueprintcovered desks mild office politics lots of presentations and buzzwords and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way. i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work and it was good in a lot of ways but i was happy to leave. xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. actually this thing is new to me. thanks sure thing. the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook. that gets put onto the suggestions page which ill move it to in a moment. over the next few days people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long if it needs sources whatever else. if youre able to respond to those comments if there are any made then your article might get selected. schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what its not easy to do that since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page so i really cant just point you to a page and say here you are. what particularly do you want to see? if youre after examples of the kinds of comments people make just keep an eye on the suggestions page. schreit mich an caucasian ethnicitiessemites are caucasian. or indeed not. see for example semitic which clearly indicates otherwise. they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indoeuropean people who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless theres some startling new research out there i dont think that comment is accurate. schreit mich an im not even going to dignify this with a response. use,0
3281,3281,i dont want anything in this article that isnt specific to rushtons book including generic comments by gilwhite that dont address rushton in particular and certainly not his book. just because gilwhite mentions rushton elsewhere in his book does not justify putting a completely separate criticism of race theories in general in section to devoted to criticism of his book. if you insist upon putting in generic critiques against race in general ill insist on putting in references that defend race in general. people come here not to read about the race debate in general but about this specific book and the response it got. i have no problem with the native american argument if it can be cited as a critique against this book but for now its an orginal argument composed by wikipedia editors.,0

3303,3303,history of primal therapy articlei read through the recent discussions on talkprimaltherapy. i also added two more comments to the talkarthurjanov page. did you send an email enquiry? the date for france ds marriage to art is without credibility. after the divorce to vivians great credit she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov. after all he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated. chapter . and according to france d. janovs own admission in the primal centers video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. so its a fact that art married a former patient.my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. it isnt really the place to dissect janovs reputation. i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies but in many cases it has got out of hand. i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article. the conocer piece doesnt strike me as a sound source of verifiable information so i put together some links to articles which can be found onlineif you type emotional intelligence into google the no. result is steve heins website. he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janovs primal center in the late s. you can find his interview notes here labelled cautionary note.janovs bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr. janov’s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr. erik hoffman former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university. you can read what erik hoffmann ph.d. is doing now at hoffmanns website.on this page you can find a transcript of dr. e. michael holdens account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute.carol mithers book therapy gone mad identifies case histories from janovs first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy. simon thanks simon why cant you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page? i dont think the history idea will come to much there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingolds latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. i have already read the michael holden swan song twice sad case. you seem to be applying two standards of evidence. the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janovs books alone which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. last september i wrote in the primal therapy talk page will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbachers method or the international primal association or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the s? there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article for a start two books about the center for feeling therapy erik hoffmanns bio and the transcript of dr. e. michael holdens audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in . the books by carol mithers and tomas videgård are already referenced in the main article. i have a copy of videgårds book by the way. also professor steven rose wrote a onepage account of his research with arthur janov in lifelinesas janov had hoped it turned out that before therapy the quantity of these particular receptors in his clients platelets was considerably below normal. within six months of therapy clients depression had lifted and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for normal nondepressed people of the same age and sex.further down the same page he addedi obtained similar biochemical results when a couple of years later i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other less dramatic forms of psychotherapy so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.having participated in the editing of articles in t,0

3322,3322, yeah i think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors arent just mere repetitions of the authors statement and dont elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. also ill like to point out these mistakes in your comment per eliade approximative understanding partly of apparently nonarabian rites so not mucheildae never says it was nonarabian. shes talking about monophysite rites and monophysite was the largest branch of christianity in arabia. per watt details that may be surmised by close analysis muhammads lifehe also argues that these verses might be attacking christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. also in the final ill like to say again the subject of the article isnt about quran and its historicity and interpretations. so adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text. ,0

3344,3344, trimming sounds fine but where a dispute comes up i would recommend slowing things down. focus on one or two specific quotes and if someone reverts instead of immediately reverting back try to come up with a compromise version. ditto with the other person reverting instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version try to come up with a compromise. with each person changing each others work rather than reverting it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. also use clear calm and neutral edit summaries referring strictly to the article and not the editors. in terms of refactoring what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to. when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or hes just always stubborn then thats getting away from discussing the article content and is veering off into discussing the editors. better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors. good habits to develop though they can take time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your. also avoid naming specific editors in a post as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive and then they may miss everything else thats said. instead when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done diff the edit without mentioning the editor. like i disagree with this edit diff as i feel its a violation of policy/guideline. a better way to handle things would be suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this but i have seen that using this kind of thirdparty discussion technique can work wonders in deescalating disputes. it also tends to make whoever is using the technique sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful even if offwiki they may be hopping mad. it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action. when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute and they see everyone yelling at each other the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong. the admin wont care who started it theyll just address things as they see them in that moment. but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly and one editor being uncivil then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption. caveat just because one editor is being uncivil doesnt necessarily mean that theyre in the wrong. but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all theyre doing is namecalling rather than actually discussing the article then thats a problem that an administrator can easily address by removing the nonconstructive editors from the discussion. onka ,0

3353,3353,it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre but i was trying to correct and add some information about him. i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a prolefebvre position as well. i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre. the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that. both men tried to derail the second vatican council and fought both john xxiii and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way. i dont know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george iii was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant. and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council. why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church? it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity. i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while he didnt exactly what his grandfaters reasons were but he said it probably wasnt hard to guess why.even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article. thats why i added the tag because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction. jun utc,0

3444,3444,csd aokay sorry about that i was just really confused as to what they were pertaining to but i now see that there is a main la liga article that does provide context. thanks. sorry that was my mistake i misunderstood it. thew user i know its this guy. the article clearly should be deleted and an afd would be pointless. if i were an admin i would block him right away and delete his stuff. well blocked isnt banned. repeated block evasion might result in banning though. moreover i actually deleted an artcile of his per wikipediaarticles for deletion/quantum ring theory. that mentioned some naveen dankal so the latest account might be also be likeminded person. ill give him a welcome page and then well see. oh youre an admin? i thought there was some sort of rule that admins had to say so on their user pages.he might not be technically banned but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were. i dont know how else to deal with this. not sure about the rule but i actually forgot to restore my user page after latest wikibreak.for the moment i assume the two accounts are not the same. if not well certainly notice and can take action. heisenbergs scientific method naveen dankal with due respect to heisenberg and his contribution to science i don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidual.i have only stated some of the limitations of heisenbergs works with due references and just brought out a fact how heisenbergs method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way lopesidedness of our universe.i just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia. on the other hand i also disagree with the block you received resp. the unblock denied and have raised that point. thanks for unblocking...appreciate your step...will try to keep wiki rules in mind may well let me know once you have further concerns or questions. naveen dankal i am making a few changes in the article on heisenbergs scientific method.i would like to know wether any refernces to banned members works jeopardizes the articles chances of getting hosted or such refernces can be incorporated without any hitch. moreover before hosting the articles can they be emailed to the administrators for a review so that the users are not lead to the worries of being blocked or banned?there are two different issues. the . while that doesnt mean they can never be cited it is unlikely to go without discussion. your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations. what is missing is the intermediate step what reliable sources have written about e.g. the mystery of the scarcity of the dineutron or limitations of the copenhagen interpretation. without including such secondary sources it will be a wpsy,0

3456,3456, north korea actually gained approximately km² from china in the treaty. and heres a th century book by chong yagyong titled koreas northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by peter hacksoo lee a long time ago the area north of the tumen river was the land of the sushen people. it has not been under our control since the time of the three han. the southern slopes of mount changbaek where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters lay within our territory but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. however emperor kanghsi in the final years of his reign ordered area commander wula wula tsungkuan muketeng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. as a result the border between those two rivers is clear as well. emphasis mineheres another study of the usnorth korea border in by the us dept of state which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain. and another which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in . the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border and of course a few ultranationalist sites but please enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. on another rather amusing note it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits and which prefer to judge a book by its cover and lash out emotionally. should be made in a new section on the talk page. no further edits should be made to this section. the result of the debate was no move. requested movechonji → tianchi – the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus for pov reasons cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean its on the border between china and korea. another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well. however a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi and and less than each for chonji and cheonji. thats two orders of magnitude in difference. the preceding was quoted by yuje surveyadd support or oppose followed by a brief explanation then sign your opinion with support for the most common name. searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake. the use of chonji as a clear common name doesnt apply because its not common. support — per yuje. naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. oppose per visviva and my previous comments. like i said before we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china. as shown chonji is nowhere near common. chonji barely shows up any hits therefore isnt a viable alternative for a clear alternative name. oppose look at my reason below. comment the proposition seems to be flawed... given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else perhaps tianchi changbaishan or even heh heh tianchi paektusan but then again maybe tianchi jilin... if we must have a straw poll it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is. comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldnt be ignored. thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi disambiguation page. either one is a reasonable alterna,0

3464,3464,please consult the article ball culture which states drag queen or transgendered. wpor does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together. as well the term femme queen does not have an article so the term is currently of dubious usage as its a neologism which wp policy suggests to avoid using. you state a source tgmsmnet however neither this page nor the mainpage refer to such a reference. from the way you talked about it i linked it to the mstsw reference. in the future if you could could you please site resources on this page by using this form? that way it shows up like this and one can simply click on the resource rather than search through the article for the reference itself. your data is backed up there as well. however we still have issue... how would the cdc consider a postop mtf living in stealth as anything else but a female... the mtf would obviously not admit to being a transsexual and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female. i wait for further evidence that tg/ts is caused by biological factors and thus the term biological male/female becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with cais is biologically a male... as well i understand the point of not using wp as a soap box... however in talk pages im still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having urap... ,0

3506,3506, utci dont think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written . the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others for a direct and definite compensation wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.for instance in the light of holocaust in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention but was taken to a tragic extreme. likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker if it is a profession has shown to conducted wholly for business gain i.e. higher profit larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain often to the detriment to the business e.g. accountants in the enron scandal. i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition and one that is couched in more modern language. talkcontribs november,0

3517,3517, disruptive activity please stop your disruptive editing. if you continue to vandalize wikipedia as you did at paracetamol you may be blocked from editing. 🍌 email yeah so i add two interesting and important new relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the paracetamol page. these are removed because you guys dont like primary sources? this is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with wikipedia. my wife is pregnant. i for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. i would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the first do no harm idea. the fact that you wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. ive continued to run into this kind of thing. you would think that academic journals have taken over wikipedia. the idea that i have actually improved the article with my additions and that others can improve it further has completely escaped much of the wikipedia culture these days. wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. you guys are disgusting really. you are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created wikipedia in the first place. the fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply. im sorry that ive upset you but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. that is why weve written wpmedrs which i pointed to when i reverted you. there is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at wpwhymedrs. the fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results cant be transferred into clinical practise. medrs is no catch all but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. i would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically for example by having fda warnings automatically added.i understand it may feel as if youre being reverted by a faceless mass but i assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive. 🍌 email this isnt about my feelings it is about your behavior. you revert me with no reason then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. this is why wikipedia is dying cannibalizing its editors and edits in a kafkaesque farce. congratulations im sure your nodoubt proper and uplifting zyzzyxrd will be cited upon its demise. you may want to try and comprehend your own actions and not my feelings. see . ,0

3519,3519,you resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile binksternet.for starters dating back to the original discussion back in december while the user optigan liked financialnorth he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo to which no including paulh or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. as im saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed no decision was made and the discussion ended. paulh or you did not say anything. if he wanted the photo then why didnt he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? i wouldve left it at that then but instead he and other editors remained silent. i didnt restart the discussion because i assumed that the editors simply lost interest or didnt have the time.furthermore i did not slip in as you disgustingly dishonestly facetiously say. i only added that photo because i noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in january. again no one did anything for months. you and paulh cannot claim you didnt see the change because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.again paul did not form a consensus prior to the change or continue the discussion where it had left off. once again he instead changed the photo got a consensus from binksternet. the ip editor liked the photo but quoting the editor againany of the photos in that section federal reserve band san francisco.jpg except would be fine as a replacement and even the cropped version of is better than the one currently there now. thoughts?... talkim going to replace it with and see what happens.the crux of it was that paulh made the change before even binksternet approved it or i or other editors could respond.binksternets abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. despite my reverts i at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were. paulh did not and binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. i dont see binksternet asking the ip editor in question or other editors to the sf article including optigan have their say either in this. he is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus something that at least paulh did earlier. only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me ,0

3533,3533,ivo banac...a bit of nonteleological historyone of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. for example if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. croatia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river a little bit to the east of the city of split. down the coast from the original croatia we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus the tenthcentury byzantine emperorhistorian called pagania literally land of the pagans zachlumia most of presentday eastern herzegovina with the croatian peninsula of peljesac terbounia the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina with dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs and dioclea the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of presentday albania around lake skadar/shkoder. serbia is located in the hinterland of zachlumia terbounia and dioclea its center around ras near todays novi pazar in the sandzak. bosnia was apparently within this territory but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river where we now find sarajevo and its environs. and dalmatia? in the tenthcentury this was a necklace of byzantineruled roman coastal cities and island territories from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south.moreover modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. thus unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnicas opposed to culturalcontinuity. the croat historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of dioclea a twelfthcentury text from bar in contemporary montenegro and its various translations for example marko marulic which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and dalmatian histories of mavro orbin and ivan lucic ioannes lucius . these works then became material for the croatianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic croatia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of ljudevit gaj and that of postrevival integral nationalists like ante starcevic . curiously the same histories orbins were serbianized through the translations of sava vladislavic which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of jovan rajic and were bulgarianized in the history of paisij hilandarski . the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more selfcontained. it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan notable selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia for example antun knezevic whose book was published between and .clearly something has happened in the span of ten centuries. pagania zachlumia and terbounia have disappeared. the center of croatia has migrated from the adriatic to the north into medieval slavonia literally slavic land with zagreb at its head. this happened in stages. during the high middle ages the heart of croatia was on the una river now in northwestern bosnia. this territory turkish croatia was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia. during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century the framework of modern croatia emerged in two extended shanksone to the north to modern slavonia the other in the south in modern dalmatia. at the same time the zagreb area which was only dubiously croatian in the early middle ages became the heart of modern croatia.the story of serbia is not much different. serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated dioclea. then it moved to the ibarmorava valleys then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia. it reached the danube only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. and its modern capital belgrade became truly serbian only in the course of karadjordjes uprising in . bosnia too expanded under ban or prorex kulin r. into the donji kraji literally lower lands around the vrbas river and the soli literally salt lands for centuries ottoman then modern tuzla and usora in its present northeastern corner. later on at the height of its power in fourteenth century bosnia expanded into hum herzegovina and the drina river valley. the westernmost regions were inc,0

3535,3535,editor review hey thanks for your review of me at er. i was previously aware of the naming conventions debate. it is a tough topic obviously. i support a fairly common sense approach to the subject. if it deals with politics name it by political entity if it deals with geography name it by place etc. ill stop by the chinese naming conventions page later today and catch up on the recent discussion.i didnt know previously about your project to clean up chinarelated categories. cleaning and reorganizing categories is one of my favorite gnomelike tasks to do on wp. what specific changes did you have in mind?i really should help out more at fac. sometimes i just dont want to read all the way through an article. lazy i know. ill look into conflict mediation too.as for my translation of the chinese redology page i kind of got frustrated because my chinese ability is not quite good enough to do a good translation. english is my native language im only a thirdyear student of chinese. someone else seems to have translated some of the material and put it on our redology page. thanks again for the review hope to work with you soon.,0

3557,3557,skywriter i have tried to be civil with you. i would ask that you return the favor. remember i didnt even write the old lede i picked that as merely being most likely to be noncontroversial. also note that on every single edit page theres a big statement saying if you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it. part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing. its nothing personal.if you see no evidence that kinzers book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran then you did not read the book or the reviews.amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is merely how good one is. but whatever you didnt include a direct mention in the most recent version so lets just drop this. and for about the billionth time since you mention in my edit summary that im criticizing kinzer.... im doing no such thing. im sure the book is very good judging from the review given by the cia history fellow. but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself. people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong so this was not a new revelation.aggression aside snowfire the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address. if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording feel free to bring it here for comment. i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede and now its a windy analysis. got it. but aside from sniping you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing. it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede. there are a million and one possible sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede we have to pick which ones. i have no doubt that your text was sourced it doesnt mean its automatically appropriate for the lede.yes and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. fast and loose with factslet me say it again are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup? do you realize what references are for? its to confirm facts. this fact is obvious and supported by every source including your own so it doesnt particularly matter what it was referenced to. if you want to source it better have a blast but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts.albrights apologyyouve got a point that the linked nytimes article doesnt call it apology. remember i didnt write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than wed like.the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup. however the cias accounting published in three years after the publication of kinzers pathbreaking book must be weighed against the cias destruction of most of its documents related to this coupwait the cia destroyed the documents so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it? that logic doesnt flow. more to the point the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source. i havent read all the shahs men but from your linked book review the one by a notable person not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that too i quote..eisenhower and his secretary of state john foster dulles were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscows machinations.kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen.by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. lastly mossadeqs naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh partys efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions. he seemed almost blithely unaware that prosoviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe. by not reining in irans communists he fell on washingtons enemies list. ....yeah. as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source. also note that dulles is described as moralistic i.e. interested in stopping the communists not greedy / interested in oil. squares with what i know of dulles anyway.the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol,0

3571,3571,thanks very much for the restored toungoo map. borders its close enough but i wish its possible to use increasingly lighter shades. e.g. youve followed the presentday border more or less for the chinese border which i suppose is a reasonable representation of the line of control. but the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. anaukpetlun and thalun controlled some of koshanpye campaigns on top of presentday shan state and east of bhamo though not as extensive or deeper into yunnan as did bayinnaung likewise all the sawbwas in modern kachin state and sawbwas in northern shan state also paid dual tribute. but since its not technically feasible i guess well just have to provide an explanation on this. a number of locations are offsome by a lot. chiang mai ava kyaukse nyangshwe pegu and kale. also please add the cities of nan and chaing saen in lan na. nan was the easternmost possession. chaing saen kyaing thin was the capital of northern lan na. the burmese divided lan na into two.again thanks very much for the help. regards ,0

3610,3610, obviously there is some antiamericanism in canada. this means nothing necessarily with regards to the structure of this article. i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans. and i asked for another side of the story and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. your response here is confusing. as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article not making additions to the article. several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim antiamericanism on the basis of involvement in the middleeast... that doesnt mean its a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries. as far as your sources go you did not comment on the obscurity of them. you have still not properly defended james tagg yes that was me who removed that a year ago. i dont see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or rather inappropriate to add. i read that source left you detailed comments and you said something like dont pov push and reverted my edits. you are not making an argument here. re culture clash in archive again there are two sides to every story. please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed and why do students opinions have so much weight by the way?. but there likely wont be many sources to support this because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldnt exist for a counter argument. nevertheless ill take a look...one last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality and onesideness breaching neutrality. i am not trying to say that what youre saying is not true at all. im sure it is true the the extent that it is. but how much is that? the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article that they should be immediately moved.,0

3643,3643,so i hope you will oppose any version of fr that would not have prevented this case as not being fit for purpose. in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have % prevented the ted kennedy incident.i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all. i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare. why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? and any interested observers please stop before you say it these valid concerns with what fr is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant advantage of fr of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles.and to further address the specific example you give maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim when it was added to the article along with another sentences which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax and at worst screams delete me now for being total wpbollocks. we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is % complete bollocks? even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. a systemic failure perhaps?and finally as an admin perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now blocked irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. incidentally the now famous bad account on ted kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article. another systemic failure?im all for criticla analysis of cases fr would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer about the whole model of wikipedia never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations. ,0

3651,3651,kanes secrecy?quote from the articleif the allied campaign were to be completed in red alert the allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of red alert . it should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original tiberian dawn manual which states that nod is an african group in its origin making no mention of the soviet union whatsoever.if the instruction manual was written by gdi then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of nod were. maybe kane planted information stating that it was from africa or maybe it really was from africa and kanes attempts to drum up support in the ussr were unsuccessful. regardless it doesnt seem to conflict especially if it could be established that the manual was a gdi document and therefore biased and uninformed.... please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime. either by clicking on that hyperlink or by visiting an online dictionary. the sooner the better to be perfectly honest. as an aside the changes to the section you indirectly are proposing would translate to a classic example of original research. the sections current content is sourced through the referencing of several different publications and statements of various c development teams rendering it fully verified. ,0

3680,3680,reverting to last known edit by me. the article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. if sysops examine the network log files they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from / truth sites and the vast majority of exit links go to / truth sites. therefore removing that information was damaging wikipedias reputation. visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that jones is currently involved in which of course includes everything relating to / that was on that page.using the ct term to describe / theories is ad hominem and also not npov and therefore not civil. anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not npov and ask them to not edit the / pages.as the zogby poll shows % of america believes the government is covering up / and % want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.for now on any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using wikipedia protocol.also even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation i do apologize for them. anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. i expect anyone and everyone to be civil.,0

3683,3683,i know derex very well. he has been stalking me ever since i wrote the campaign finance article months ago. i tell him if he finds anything incorrect in what i write to help himself and fix it but he then ignores me and i find comments of his later on talk pages with vailed insults about spamming pages and calling me a zealot. he is clearly a stealth idealogue who has no intention of making constructive edits. his only goal appears to be stalking other constructive editors.as for your statement that i am placing a relatively long fundraising scandal section into this article hogwash. a short two sentence paragraph with a link to the main article is not a long section. wikipedia rules clearly state we are to link relevant articles to eachother. as the dnc was fined for illegal fundraising and many of its fundraiser were convicted of crimes this page is the most relevant page to link my article to. an article by the way that has featured status and has been showcased on wikipedias main page. i am putting the info back into the article where it belongs. i am not waiting months for some imaginary discussion to take place here. no one reads talk pages and the few that would actually stop by will be partisans. if you continue to delete factual referenced history from this article i will report you to the moderators. good day ,0

3690,3690,as far as presenting sources are concerned the book the life and exploits of alexander the great sites much more sources in detail than source which i think refers to some sources already referred by others. as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps perhaps not. as far as the author is concerned in my understanding he himself suggested that the story of alexander that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat to these countries then we must not look for the original alexander story. similarly we must not look to the states of greece for it because at the death of alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. one country only could be the birthplace of the alexander story and that country was egypt... i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the alexander story from egypt as authentic which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding. this according to me forms one of the essence of the alexander story and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i dont have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins. at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the alexander story from egypt and not his fanboy fantasies from greece to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.,0

3697,3697, i already know the map from john speed but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoye/suraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors. the deutschen dont call themselves germans germanen or alemanes alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word suryoye/suraye was mistranslated into assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists. do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the th century and in their own words which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity? the syriacorthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate suryoyo with oromoyo in their own words. interestingly the arameans from maalula who are either christian melkites or muslims call their aramaic language/dialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoythaaramoytha which is a result of greekchristian influence on the arameans. the word suryoyo which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites catholics or melkites. nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. even if the word suryoyo derives from assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name. ,0
3698,3698,managing the content of articles when a plant product whether food or other is not in a relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem. here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach theres bound to be some overlap with genus/species articles. this article seems to me about right in its focus on what englishspeakers normally mean by banana namely the food where it comes from what it is how its grown etc. it would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to musa genus perhaps with some crossreferencing so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic but this would be a marginal change. ,0

3713,3713,== unblock requests =={{unblock reviewed=sorry for my blurb here i went in detail elsewhere. if an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology they will notice that ive been patient while i had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. that creates a very stressful situation. please see here for outside opinion. i did not use the same kind of language against hrafn and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while i added content to the article. i was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it even before the afd process. i noticed it was a stub and started to add content. how am i being disruptive to other there when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? i even listed potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be an editor of astrotheology and add content. hrafn on the talk page even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. it is obvious he was against something but that something wasnt me like he thought and he couldnt believe otherwise or choose not to. somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment i got from hrafn to where durova stepped in and it went directly to arbcom. she did ask about pastordavid but i looked and i left evidence on an/i of why i didnt accept his offer that is not a refusal to dispute resolution that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an afd. i felt another mentor/mediator would be best. personal attack/comment redacted by if you look however i did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to hrafn about rs/n over the physicotheology book... he didnt answer at all to that question but he went on to despise me instead with more egregious misintrepretations. as for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that durova noted those werent because of disruptive editing. i never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. if you seriously think i did it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. the previous mediation was recommended by a mentor comments redacted by i hate the show the mistakes she made also we arent allknowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? the computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why i got blocked before. after unblock the consensus continued and it still sustains today. if i truly was trying to disrupt like durova claims dont you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. comment redacted by it would be a test to see if she requests unblock but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again i really doubted her olive branch. i deleted a section here on my talk page of her vanish forever bit. i simply did not reply to her comment redacted by you can argue all you want that i changed the section title which policy does allow for neutral view comments redacted by when arbcom said this is obvious i truly dont think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help offer to help mediate. i saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides pastordavids. however i sent an email to ask her why... why.. why..... but now she is calling it obscene and offers to show it to any admin. if you read itcomment redacted by like i said on an/i...decline=reason — not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words the gd word primarily to his opponents. i see no reason to unblock. the consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle and the community has handled. june ,0

3799,3799,well there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarnos words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia uk etc. but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the gs forces and those loyal to suharto. im of the opinion that the period of combat was brief and that after jakarta was seized by nasutionsuharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence why the pkis central committeein exile called it just a white terror. but of course however the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to maos peoples war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict. hence i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations.by i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to reestablish the party. unfortunately it is without copyright information printed this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the u.s. cold war. i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war. at any rate toodles. ,0

3826,3826,great but what i meant about weakest link is that i dont see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources ive seen have you got a source that places something called postindustrial in the context of the history of noise music? im presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the post tag.unless the sources are good on this its too divergent in my opinion to include right now. some of what might be called postindustrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesnt warrant inclusion. you might as well do a section on deathmetal and its precursors but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music.personally i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music or any composer/artist that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making and i dont think that is what should happen with this article unless the claims are sourced and thats why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. we now see a number of artists for example jeff mills being redefined as a postindustrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now. i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic. ,0

3861,3861,ahh yes. by mormons in this instance i do mean members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints. i can see how youd read that section in this way. perhaps we can clarify what do you suggest? it is not that the doctrines changed but rather that what smith emphasized changed. what is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and as you likely know has always been the case. many things that church members believe to be doctrine is not but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members. in any case the teachings of smith and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate or that he changed doctrines or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters. we have to balance this to be historically accurate with what is believed and taught today. not an easy task. im open to suggestions in how to change wording. lets discus here and then make the changes. suggestions? also id invite you to join wikipedia. we always need newcomers. registration is easy ,0

3889,3889,i was requested to provide an opinion here by comfykem. everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both and thats sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. however theres no reason in principle why each cant have an article as long as there is sufficient distinctive reliably sourced material in each to merit that. this appears to be the case here just about though bloating the lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful. if we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species as plantdrew suggests it would probably be best to have it at the species name as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.,0

3926,3926,i understand the confusion. you would think that since a primary source is a firsthand account it would be the most reliable. however the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. also there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. thats when a secondary source comes in. a secondary sources author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion evaluation and/or conclusion. furthermore secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. it helps us avoid original research. one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions whether intentionally or not which would be considered original research. you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wprs and wpsource. ,0

3963,3963, proposed page move volleyball at the summer olympics – mens tournament → volleyball at the summer olympics – mens indoor tournament volleyball at the summer olympics – womens tournament → volleyball at the summer olympics – womens indoor tournament beach volleyball at the summer olympics – mens tournament → volleyball at the summer olympics – mens beach tournament beach volleyball at the summer olympics – womens tournament → volleyball at the summer olympics – womens beach tournament– volleyball in the olympic context seems to refer to both volleyball in general and indoor volleyball specifically. i think we need to clarify this and create a uniform pattern for the names of these articles. since both indoor and beach volleyball are presented in volleyball at the summer olympics article and the sports are basically the same the prefix bit should be uniform hence this proposal. when this issue is decided we can go on with the older olympics tournaments which follow neither of the above name patterns. ,0

3970,3970, explanation dear edjohnston and bearian i am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in wikipedia pages.here in ust global wikipedia page i update the latest information regarding ust gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category. under corporate milestones company achievements needs to be listed. the link may have the recent major information about ust global but the top part of the page that mentions about key executives is totally wrong. two people and their postions who are not part of ust global is being mentioned here. ust global is a company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key roles/posts during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this company related records but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with ust global. this is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policyplease advice me if i am wrong in my understanding.thank youchellappa.m ,0

3979,3979,to respond generally to the statements made above its noteworthy to mention tillmans religion in light of the controversial statements made by ralph kauzlarich regarding the familys beliefs and how it relates to the investigation of his death. additionally since this is apparently hard to find the biography by jon krakauer refers to pat tillman as an agnostic and possibly even an atheist. im sure if someone wants to actually read the book they can find a relevant quote to include. on a more personal note this entire discussion topic stinks of religious paranoia....,0

3986,3986, january you currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a hour period. additionally users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule. if you continue you may be blocked from editing. please do not repeatedly revert edits but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. if necessary pursue dispute resolution. do not continue removing reliable sourced information from the article purely because you disagree with its validity. the only proof of it being false is the personal belief of a handful of editors which does not invalidate the information.  talk · contribs ,0

3989,3989, thanks for the edits. i am not aware of any split in the us between higher doctorates and others. the phd dphil not awarded here in my experience is typically a or year degree but as that time period often includes mslevel classwork it seems parallel to your phd. when awarded in the us the dsc is the precise equivalent of the phd. the ranking you list divinity laws or civil law medicine and letters and above music is at least not well known in the us. it would be helpful to include the degree names in the above list since i certainly dont know them all. md is as you say a professional degree as is drph in public health. i think the general attitude is to regard all doctoral degrees as on par and honorary degrees as strictly honorary and not pertaining to academic work. this is something of a mess isnt it? talk ,0

3994,3994,danny your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again. as the wikipedia page says . . .you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets this does not provide as much information to readers but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website and none of the watchtowers multiple links no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. as for the links to quotes websites they are extremely encyclopaedic and the page has no commentary but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage rather than just a few selective quotes. they are all given their source publication date and page numbers for proof and reference. your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing. you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesnt suit your agenda not dissimilar to your religious organisation. i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months you feel the desperate need to hide accurate comprehensive dated quotes direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society? if you can give all the publications from the watchtowers website then im sure many here will be only to happy to list that link but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on . you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site merely saying its not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality and your desperate urged to manipulate the public. posted central august ,0
