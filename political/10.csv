18000,another common theme of the financial media is to claim that japan is a source of liquidity to the world. low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans and thus money isnt available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans. the money supply in japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs and assets of all kinds have been bid to skyhigh valuations. thus it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in europe and the united states and not by the shrinking money supply in japan.the bottom line is that i dont feel this will have a happy ending for the united states. the dollar has dropped .% in the past week which for the worlds largest economy is pretty much on the threshold of a currency crisis.,0

18017,re your claims about the census firstly there is solid evidence that the romans required a census every fourteen years because thats the interval between recorded censuses. one such census is known to have occurred around the time that the birth of jesus would have occurred. secondly galilee would not have been exempt since even virtually autonomous cities like apamea in syria were not exempt despite having almost complete selfgovernance. thirdly a roman edict from g. vibius maximus concerning a similar roman census says explicitly that citizens were required to return to their home town just as it says in the bible. fourthly the same edict says that each man had to bring his entire family with him just as it says in the bible.,0

18021,i take personal offense to the term antiscience religious propaganda fluff piece. that sir is borderline hate speech in the context you have attempted to use it in. cadedral is a personal friend residing in an entirely different country than i. he happens to also believe that all facets of paleontology should be represented in the paleontology article as properly cited pieces of evidence. and censoring the documented instances of fraud and scientific viewpoints of millions of christians and yec is irresponsible and only perpetuates the widely revered opinion that wikipedia is a liberally biased engine. what you are doing is injecting your personal preference into science. which is again irresponsible.,0
18022, bush and jfk the recent th anniversary upsurge in kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in has caused many conspiracy theories to be reexamined. more often ghw bushs name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy. his favoring of nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory as does the depth of nixons corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.i feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of ghwbs career especially as both bush presidents were such avid warmongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the militaryindustrial influence that eisenhower warned the nation against. bushs attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the vietnam war.,0

18110, operation northwords listing operation northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of conspiracy theory that this article gives. if a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a coordinated group which is or was secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities then operation northwoods does not fit the criteria. first of all the cia does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. it is a known agency and the plans of operation northwoods are no more a conspiracy theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the cia plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. secondly operation northwoods was not a conspiracy within the cia either. not one cia member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. it other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. and because of that fact it was shot down the architect of the plan was fired the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the freedom of information act. this is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory. conspiracism the section conspiracism saysconspiracy theories are often not taken seriously because so many conspiracy theories almost by definition lack readily verifiable evidence. this phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words often taken not seriously has anybody made a statistic? many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence how many? and it happens almost by definition?? what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence??? if nobody has nothing to comment about that i will delete the sentence above. i disagree with the above sentence and for sure it is not neutral but guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them vide the / passport i dont want to argue was it fabricated i mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated. sequence of sections and bias the way this article is set up suggests a very very strong pov and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. first problem is the examples for one they shouldnt be the second thing since its mainly a partial list. this should be towards the end of the article. also there is the descriptionsthe john f. kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman lee harvey oswald. oliver stones film jfk is based on this premise.while this is a conspiracy theory one i think is somewhat likely it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by cuba or the soviets. the ufo conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. some theories are that the u.s. government conceals an alien presence because theyre afraid of it causing a scare which sounds more reasonable than to be used for war and other ideas mainly towards the new world order.also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. it seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. this section also is half of the actual article with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. for instance there are legitimate questions about such as the $ given to atta by a head of the isi. there are also allegations that the commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. in every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. for instance one is that the administration is trying to cover up connections between pakistan and/or saudi arabia and . this w,0

18121,if you read the oohashi paper you will see the trouble they have gone to to source ultrasonic music from gamelans special playback equipment special tweeters etc .... everything checked from source to speaker system. meyer moran does not even seek to be a test of ultrasonics. it does not pretend to be a test of ultrasonics. it does not claim to be a test of ultrasonics. if you wish to assert that meyer moran is a test of ultrasonics you will have to formally prove that each and every one of the elements of the chain passes the ultrasonic test. so lets check it out. source material this is discusssed at it turns out that the vast majority of source discs used by meyer moran were recorded in the s s or s ... they are cd quality masters and therefore do not have ultrasonic content. summary source material fails ultrasonic test. the playback equipment used by meyer moran has to be able to reproduce ultrasonics. the source equipment used by meyer moran is listed atthe principal equipment consisted of an adcom gtp preamp and snell c/v speakers.you can find the specs for the adcom gtp preamp herethe specs are listed as hz to khz. fails ultrasonic testthe specs for the snell c/v speakers are given herethey show massive dropoff above khz. failsummary the playback equipment used by meyer moran cannot reproduce ultrasonics properly.grand summary meyer moran is not a test of ultrasonics. meyer moran do not claim it is a test of ultrasonics. the only person claiming that it is a test of ultrasonics is you it is your own original research which is a violation of the wiki original research provisions. worse your claim is completely flawed and erroneous at every level of the chain from source material through to speakers.ill leave this up for a day or so for some discussion. if you cannot prove your original claims then ... out it goes.p.s. your lehrman reference is just a quote of meyer moran it also has absolutely nothing to do with hypersonic or ultrasonics. you might want to take this to the cd advocacy page but it has nothing to do with the ultrasonic effect. out it goes. ,0

18170,i just think its interesting how many revisions this has gone through ... heres the original gutenberg encyclopedia article that i pasted here originally that has had the socalled islamic bias removed. i do know it needed editing revising expanding and to be brought up to the times. just something interesting to think about.allah the arabic name used by moslems of all nationalities for the one true god. it is compounded of al the definite article and ilah meaning a god. the same word is found in hebrew and aramaic as well as in ancient arabic sabaean. the meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful cf. lanes arabicenglish lexicon p. and the oxford hebrew and english lexicon pp. ff. a previous version of the allah article included the followingallah was also the proper name for the preislamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic arabic tribes. the name and has no femminine or plural forms. allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods such as the goddesses allat? and manat?anybody know why was this removed?it seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. it appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man robert mory in the last years.well insofar as allah doubles as the name god in arabic were up against the problem solved in english by capitalization capital g for the monotheistic god of the jews and christians who prefers that we not use his first name versus the gods with a small g. allah was undoubtedly used about all sorts of deities and thats where the moondeity argument falls down. and watch out about publishing the femaletrinity bit isnt that what got salman rushdie in trouble? michael tinkler.i authored the paragraph about the moongod theory. i read about this in islam by jamal j. elias a muslim author. the book is an intorduction to islam from the pov of a liberal muslim scholar. as elias is associate professor of religion at amherst college massachusetts and he writes on this theory as if it were fact it seems there is more to this picture than the poor work of one scholar. therefore i have restored the paragrah with a note on its contoversy.i also authored the bit about yahweh that was taken out. critism accepeted it belongs in its own article. so i have put it in yahweh. it does seem true that allah was the name of a moon god and that mohammeds father had allah as part of his name. but the name does have a feminine form al lat. it is not clear the connection of the moon god to the muslim god.ok first of all allah does simply mean the god rather equivalent to our capitalized god. hence any major god like this moon god apparently would have very likely been called god. i did some admittely internetbased research on this topic just now and clarified a few things in the actual text. let me know how it reads now.heres a question. wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a dictionary so its articles should be about topics not words per se. so is the allah article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the islamic concept of god? my initial thought would be yes.but arabicspeaking christians would use the word to refer to the christian god. does that complicate the issue? maybe. but one might argue that the wikipedia is in english this one at least and in english the word allah is generally used to refer to god specifically with reference to islam. right? so the discussion of the islamic concept of god should be under allah. does this make sense? anyone disagree?another question do muslims take allah to be the personal name for god or just the arabic language word meaning god. this could be tricky since by way of comparison some christians take yahweh to be the personal name of god while others see it as just another description i am what i am if there is only one of a class i.e. one god why would he need a personal name?well. in the listing i have that is based on hadith the teaching tradition of islam allah is listed as the first name among the names. the names read more like titles the compassionate the merciful etc. but the tradition is that they are names. ill add the list as an entry. michaeltinkleractually we already have a page under ninetynine names of allahninetynine names of allah.regarding discussion of the islamic concept of godi personally think the discussion of,0
18171,i dont know the original basis of this style but its a fact that it is the style presently used on wikipedia. one problem is that at least some of these are only proper nouns when applied as a specific title rather than generic noun itself for example as of this month congressman smith is the congressman who represents my home town. again im not agreeing or disagreeing with specific usages merely noting how this are done at this time. i see on your talkpage that another editor has already told you a good place to discuss it with a group of wp editors who deal in this area. ,0

18182,actually what is happening is wikipedia editors are doing what they should not be doing trying to apply their own opinions and what is essentially original research. watkins is referred to as a pedophile by multiple highly reliable sources. all of these sources are referring to him as a pedophile per the clinical sense one who is sexually attracted to children. it is not our place to accept or reject this information. are there reliable sources anywhere that are arguing the man is not a pedophile? if that were the case i can see why this would be up for debate. but its not nobody is claiming the man is not a pedophile. additionally before you argue that we dont know whether watkins is sexually attracted to children i highly suggest you actually take a look at the facts of the case and all the activities he has been involved. if you cant be bothered to do that because it sickens you then fine but dont claim that theres just no way for anyone to know. yo 😜 ,0

18206,your make a good point. let me first address it from the perspective of marshall hodgson.civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term often narrowly defined by language. this obviously has its limits. on the other hand the more broadly you define a civilization the more subgroupings it must include. eventually we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand. and ultimately civilizations like religions are selfdefined.hodgson considers the lands of islam to constitute a world civilization. he calls islam a world civilization in the title of his book the venture of islam conscience and history in a world civilization.for another perspective i can turn to h. patrick glenn in legal traditions of the world speaking on tradition and identity. not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition or civilization.glenn quotes fernand braudel who speaks of an underlying structure of civilization those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change or more probably disappearance of the tradition itself. applying this criteria to islamic civilization one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of islam.to summarize looking at the lands of islam with its concept of umma the shared traditions the shared arabic religious and often secular language and indeed the shared religion of islam it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world islamic civilization. ,0

18213,lets put it this way flo everyone has talked past me here for months. it is absolutely frustrating to have everything i contribute get labeled as disruptive. disruptive how? tedentious how? i sure as heck dont feel that i have done so because as far as im concerned ive acted in good faith trying to make wikipedia the best it can be.if you want to explain the rules to me and how i can be who i am on wikipedia and stay within the rules im all ears. i just want fm to leave me alone. how would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?if you have done such a good job explaining everything to me then why do i feel that ive been ganged up on without just cause? i know a lot of people who feel that wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion thats not very positive.why not listen to me? what do you all have to lose? my faith is the core of my being and its who i am. do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to wikipedia? have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?do you care how ordinary readers view wikipedia? you probably do or else you wouldnt be here. the fact is traditionally minded christians number over billion people on this planet and close to million in the united states alone. thats not some tiny crackpot minority out there. if i feel attacked by wikipedia or feel that my pov is misrepresented how do you think they feel reading wikipedia?lets face it here factually the perspective represented in the articles in the dominionism series from my perspective seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the united states regarding the christian right. why should my work be reversed when i elaborate on the dominionists pov which btw i dont agree with for the sake of ensuring fairness. or when fm removes something i wrote from a reputable evangelical ministry critical of christian reconstructionist theology? he tells me its false or that im pov pushing. how? i cited the sources which are widely respected in evangelical circles.what am i supposed to think when /s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the christian right who by the way are a minority of the total american population. bush won twice because of their support and elected the gop to congress and a majority of the statehouses. katherine yuricas and theocracywatchs pov represents a minority of the population. i have no idea where you live. perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends but they dont represent the larger picture. how is writing from the majority perspective pov pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective considering its the perspective of just a little over percent of the american population.i suggested banning partisanship as part of the npov rule and consensus rule but feloniousmonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. when he does that what am i supposed to think about his motives? i dont know him and he hasnt exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. have you ever stopped to think its not what you say but how you say it? the tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive and what am i supposed to think other than what ive said ad nauseam? i feel attacked not consulted with.so far i feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. things like wppov wppoint etc. that get put up when i feel that i have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.could you consider rephrasing it this way or this is how you should be doing this. thats constructive in my view. instead of hurling rules at me the interpretations of which i disagree with tell me why you think i stepped over the line and your rationale. i react positively to reasoned explanations not summary reversals of my work accusations of pov pushing etc. without explanation.maybe youve been at this for awhile so you take things for granted. i simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. interpretation my friend. i want to understand your interpretation and why you interpret the rules the way you do.every time i do anything from asking people what they think about the rules or my ideas for improving wikipedia i get written up on this rfc. flo please dont take this personally percent of the time i simply forget to login not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging,0

18330,how about thishow about just wait until the game gets released? i dont think its fair to call the game simply a port when it is adding on two new characters. not to mention new content. fully voice dialogue etc. theres no arguing that this is basically a remake of so but its also adding new features. therefore i dont think its a port but its not the same game either. its somewhere in between. its a remake with add ons. if yamagishi wants the remakes to feel like two totally different games then why dont we treat them as such until we find out otherwise. this is even more true for first departure. how on earth can first departure be a direct port of star ocean when it has the star ocean battle engine? according to these entries and some other news ive read it seems that both of the remakes have a fair amount of new things. being a triace fan since id advise you probably just wait. this isnt just like comparing valkyrie profile and valkyrie profile lenneth. this is much different.,0

18357,faith?faith can mean complete confidence in a person or plan etc. faith can also mean belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. when a theist speaks of his faith it is argued he refers to the latter definitions. when he wishes to assert that atheists have faith too the only definition that fits is the firstcitation needed but his argument implies the latter definitions nonetheless see equivocation.quite often theists have used the argument that life occurring from no life is highly improbable to the point of near impossibility. this is also the case with many of the proofs of god such as those by thomas aquinas which would also be more in line with the latter than the former. now while they may be wrong in their assumptions to come to the conclusion of the probability of life or the existence of god what they are speaking about would be more in line with the latter definition that the former in their argument. the validity of what they are saying does not impact what they wish to assert so they may indeed be asserting both points at the same time. perhaps a qualifier such as under a purely theological perspective would improve this paragraph. or change to the definition that usually fits within contextthe only definition that fits is the first. i could be wrong just thought i throw out this point.... ,0

18424,thank you for your kind offer reinyday. i accept. admittedly i am very new to wikipedia and am learning as i go. in my opinion this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive sweetest day article anywhere. contrary to what many may think i am not antisweetest day. i simply believe americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. the herbert birch kingston story of the origins of sweetest day is a verisimilitude meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. in fact the dissemination of this story by hallmark american greetings retail confectioners international and countless other promoters of sweetest day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. it has been going on for years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. but at what cost? america pays the cost of sweetest day in credibility a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. please allow all images to remain in the article unless they do not comply with wikipedia standards. more will be uploaded soon also please do not add any of the verisimilitudes currently used in the promotion of sweetest day unless they are characterized as such. thank you again reinyday robb,0

18471, january utctry as i might im not really able to associate your zebra analogy with this article. for it to work this would have to be an article about the colour white and even then it doesnt really work. the purpose of my change is to remove the comparison nature of the section. its not meant to be a comparison to begin with. the problem right now is that the section really violates npov it places weight on a comparison with another format rather than standing by itself. the fact it mentions bluray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the talk pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing bluray and hd dvd studio support. to be npov this part of the article needs to focus on what support hd dvd has. issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats incumbent dvd as well as bluray arent really except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.we need to move the fanboi hd dvd is better no bluray is better well hd dvd has more support no bluray has more support crap to the comparison articles. ,0

18475,why is editing closed?on the basis of logic reason and science there are no gods. science holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as truth without recourse to knowledge and reason. no evidence of any kind exists to prove supernatural phenomena are real and not imaginary creations. therefore deities can be added to the prolific list of mythical beings such as genies and wyverns which fill human mythologies.i thought wikipedia prided itself on being factual and unbiased. the facts are very straightforward. god is superstitious nonsense and this truth should not be clouded by the persistent large following of gullible individuals who still believe in the supernatural.,0

18479,comments from an evdl memberim forwarding these comments from an evdl member in the image the relay is called ry rl but down in the text its referred to as ry rs. just a question in the first part of the article it talks about how the car should operate like an ice vehicle requiring the key to be turned to the start position. but then later in the article it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal. maybe im one of those operators of older vehicles talked about but i still press the accelerator when i start my car whether its fuelinjected or not. so it seems like in the same description its trying to make the car start like an ice vehicle and yet not make it start like an ice vehicle. the rectangular area called in cab confused me. at first i thought it was some special kind of component. then i came to think that no its not a component at all it just represents somewhere inside the cab. i think this latter view is the correct one but id like text and/or picture to make it clearer. im also not sure what the short blue wire between run buss and run is for. my guess is that its for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched but the text doesnt make that clearand this also added to my confusion about the in cab being a component. i dont know what this means the run buss is grounded when not in the run state allowing additional interlocks to be included in order to ensure proper shutdown. where would these additional interlock be placed? how would they ensure proper shutdown? finally i had to think about diode d. when the key switch is in the start position and both relays are enabled there will be v on each side of the diode. therefore the diode wont conduct since one side isnt lower in voltage than the other. when the key switch is then returned to the on position the alarmstart relay will open removing the +v on the negative side of the diode so the diode will start conducting thus keeping the latch relay energized. is that correct? if so maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me. if not then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.thanks for your good work here thats for you not me. hope this helps. bill dennis ,0

18531,mangled units of transmission speedcan anyone explain what units cuteftp uses for speed i see kbs and mbs in the cuteftp queue window for example but these are not valid units. kbs suggests kilobyte seconds or kilobit seconds ... but both are nonsense units should be either kbps or kb/s. similarly mbs suggests millibyte seconds or millibit seconds which is doubly nonsense both because it is a nonsense unit and also because even if they mean mbps or mb/s it is a ridiculously small unit. i realize that they probably mean mega rather than milli but then they should use capital m.baud used to be used universally for data transmission rates and that is at least unambiguous.this is all very sloppy and of course does not reflect well on globalscape.see data rate units also see bit rate si prefix binary prefix list of device bandwidths,0

18539, about the revert on the list of windows phone . devices page hi and im here to inform you theres no such thing as a memory card reader in mobile phones and ill hope youll understand that. theyre called memory card slots and every mobile phone shop around the world mobile phone info website and phone manufacturer website/instruction manual implores theyre memory card slots because theyre not totally external off the phone though you can remove such cards from the slot.however if you still dont believe me then ask any one of your colleagues who went to info sites like gsmarena windows phone central or even engadget and youll know from them that those sites never call mobile phone memory cards slots readers. one last thing the memory card reader article is not accurate and i dont know how the memory card slot article got deleted or missing from wikipedia but if i can get more info about the differences about the two as citations then im really moving that articles name to memory card reader/slot and add info from that deleted/missing article. ,0

18553,its hard to imagine what could constitute serious opposition to mainstream antiracism but would also pass muster under your criteria. pbs and california newsreel are not scientific organizations either. however like amren they have marshalled scientists and opinion writers to help put forward their views. ironically amren has often been evaluated with alarm as more dangerous than other groups by antiracists because of the quality of its writing and its calm and scholarly tone. in any event your subjective assesment heavily influenced by your personal opinions on the subject matter of whether amrens view of race is worthwhile or base or whether the pieces writing is high quality is not sufficient grounds for removal. you will simply have to tolerate the occasional link to an article you disagree with even strongly. i will restore the link soon unless given an convincing reason why not. ,0

18562,elizabeth i was referred to as elizabeth i ever since the th century this is absolutely not a modern convention. please refrain from talking about subjects you seem not very familiar with. as for the chinese case liu bang and xiang yu were commoners and their family names were used with their given names. i believe by bc family names were starting to be commonly used in china and if you check the historical records 史记 by sima qian he refers to them as liu bang and xiang yu. on the other hand the royal family of qin were not commoners and their family name ancestral name 姓 was never used. you can check the historical records of sima qian he never writes ying ziying he always writes ziying only. it is a modern anachronism to write ying ziying. it would be like writing louis bourbon instead of writing louis xiv. ,0

18578, editing on hypertension hi docjames as a long time wikipedia watcher i feel like im talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages. im a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently and now that im getting to the end of my training id love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. as you can see im fairly new to the editing scene so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. regarding my recent edits on the hypertension article as i mentioned in the talk page im basically trying to find a way to get rid of the daunting wall of text problem that i feel the article has at the moment. id like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering whats that? can browse with relative ease. as such i feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content most of which is only relevant to medical professionals on specific pages and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. let me know what you think about this approach and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit. ,0

18684,i am not the founder i am a contributor citing the founders definition which i was able to find online as the most appropriate definition of what the organization is. what you are suggesting is absurd. you are saying that it is not appropriate to inquire what the group is about directly from the creator instead relying on the opinion of someone else who clearly is opposed to what the group represents. lets look at this from a more personal view. do either of these argument examples seem resonable when applied to other topics?example . you are jewish and tried to argue that in a wiki entry about nazisim beginnings hitlers definition of how the nazi party got perhaps extracted verbatim from mein kampf would be less relevant than say alan dershowitzs thoughts on the topic extracted from an oped peice in the times because in your view hitlers definition seemed to onesided and preachy.example . i am black and tried to argue that louis farrakhan would more neutrally write the overview entry for the leakey foundation than the groups namesake louis leakey. the reason i give for this choice is that to use leakeys comments on the subject no matter how precise his summary could only be a soapbox for his opinion and agenda.does either example seem reasonable to you if you can access the source and get an unadulterated definition?the entry i am including is very thorough and includes highly important information such as founding members date of origination what they believe what they dont believe and anything someone researching the group would want to find out. you have a userbox for this user is opposed to online censorship. but that is clearly your intent here as you are simply removing relevant information under the thin argument of saving the world from a soapbox. i am not on a soapbox. i want to get the most information out there as possible. ,0

18742,hi scorpion. im a bit aggravated as i provided a valid source from canadas walk of fame saying that ryan reynolds will not be inducted on october like it states in your edit. the way that you put is that we should ignore the source and just merge the columns on the night of october but according to sources reynolds will be unable to attend and he will be inducted at a later date and will not be featured on the televised gala. it states that he will be inducted at a later date whether it be or . we dont know the specifics if you merge the two columns on october you are providing an untruth with regards as not all announced inductees will be inducted on the same day. wwe should keep ryan reynolds seperate from the other inductees until we know for sure when he will be able to get his star.im sorry to get angry at you but i think i am within the right to add this edit on to the page because i provided a valid source from the official commitee that says that one persons involvement has been postponed and all that you are doing is reverting my edits trying to sweep this fact under the carpet. as you said in your previous edit why should it matter if the two columns will be merged in a month? well i thought wikipedia was based on facts and sources which i thought i had provided and you are selectfully omitting certain details thus allowing some inconsistencies in the article itself. you are the one that will be merging the two columns and i dont think it would be fair and truthful to just merge ryan reynolds along with the other inductees into the main grid if we still do not know when he will get inducted. thats whats getting me upset at your ways at handling the page. i did nothing wrong just provided a valid source and i truly believe that tthere should be some sort of indication on the page at least that ryan reynold could not attend on october due toi a scheduling conflict until we know of what will happen with ryan reynolds and canadas walk of fame. feel free to answer me on the talk page or my talk page. thank you.... samusek,0

18747,i would but i dont know how third estate ? national assembly ? re the tennis court oath serment du jeu de paume was a pledge signed by members of frances third estate on june . .... this was an important factor in the coming of the french revolution the members swore that they wouldnt disband until louis xvi had granted a constitution for the people of france. aaaaaaaaaah why are you changing it? im not sure but i think the oath was written by abbe sieyes? slight change changed the wording from leave to disbandsaying that they would not leave until they had written a constitution gives the impression that it was written all in one night this is not true to took along to write a constrictions for francealso and interesting fact the tennis court is speculated to having been in actuality a handball courtadding dates and sourcesso far so good but you have no dates and no sources. if there are no objections i will add dates using information from a history of western society sixth edition by mckay hill and buckler. if someone could please put that in bibliography format. im missing the first hundred pages in my book. totally vandalized and requires a rewrite well obviously this article over the past few days has been totally vandalized and stripped of its information. somebody tried to rewrite the entire and what used to be complex and informative article quickly as nobody seems to have a saved copy of the article. in need of some wiki admins. hello mehicdino im not sure whether youre talk • contribs who edited the article to remove immature/incorrect text. however can either one of you be more specific with what is inaccurate? there was some vandalism in the previous weeks which i had reverted already all revisions of the page are stored automatically and you can access them by clicking on the history tab above and clicking on the date and time of the revision. most everything in the article looks correct. granted im not an expert on this subject but given that the revision only removed minimal details which seem correct and also removed many of the wikilinks ive gone ahead and reverted back to the previous version for now. can you clarify on what is incorrect? thanks a note? vandalism should never require a rewrite as its very easy to revert to a previous version. no i am not the ip you state i could be because it does not match mine. i was just saying a few days ago somebody actually put much effort into vandalizing this article to a pile of rubbish. thanks for the reply. im just making sure that there is nothing that is obviously inaccurate presently i hope i took care of all the vandalism with the revert. thanks a note? this still needs rewriting what is this?the tennis coart started in the late s and ended in the early s. it resulted in the parilization of the queen of scottland. it occured in witchitah maine.please correct. the vandalism has already been removed thanks for letting us know. a note? picture i found a better picture at this link —the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk • contribs .im going to refrain from uploading that picture for now. i believe if my recollection is correct that the current image is a copy of the actual sketch and that the colored version was done later by anothe,0

18761,ok here goes at another attempted explanation. ignore the ip currently using /. his intentions appear to be good but i dont think he is helping. stop taking this personally. noone actually knows you all we have to go on are a set of edits. we are largely strangers to each other strong statements like betrayal and slander suggest motives that imply the other editor has taken against you personally. you are treating peoples comments in a strangely literal way. if you dont understand what someone says just ask them to explain a different way. do not assume that everything is an attack. copyright yes you may absolutely tag and report something that appears to have been copied and pasted from another source. what you need to watch for is that the other site didnt get its material from wikipedia to start with. they dont always credit wikipedia as the source. however it is better to tag it than not the project cannot afford the risk. notability rather than tag an article for deletion start a discussion. with the soap opera characters starting a general discussion about notability at the wikiproject is a good idea. if the talkpage is active start a discussion there. always try to notify the article creator. read wpbefore. nonnotable articles rarely damage the project unless they are also inaccurate or completely foolish an article about my cat for example would be completely foolish as the cat is known to noone outside my family and our neighbours and is just an ordinary cat so theres often no urgent rush to delete things that are nonnotable. someone spent time and effort working on it. what other steps might be taken can the information be merged into another article and a wpredirect used for example. if you eventually decide that nominating for a deletion discussion is the only option use a neutral rationale. do not attack the article creator because they have disagreed with you. remember it is a discussion. do not attribute any motive to those who disagree other than the differing viewpoint of a stranger. images if you find someone has pirated an image from a newspaper website and uploaded it as their own work yes you absolutely must tag it as a copyvio for speedy deletion. in other instances it is better to identify the least drastic option to deal with the damage. can i fix it myself? can i alert the uploader maybe they just made a mistake? if in doubt always tag for wppuf which results in a discussion not for deletion. talk explain why you thought what you did. dont post reams of justifications and question the motives of others. you may be right but youll lose if you cant discuss things with people. read the guidelines and policies and understand what the project is about. you havent got it yet. ,0

18793,==prime==ok first off i do not have to give a reason to you but i will. the sentence whether black lantern laurie removed superboyprimes heart at this point remains unresolved doesnt belong in a wiki article because its crystal balling. once it picks back up with prime then we add what happens but for now he was alive at the end so we leave it alone like that. also do not revert edits unless you have a solid reason just because somebody undos your edit and you get upset doesnt give you the right to undo the edits. this is a good way of getting in trouble. i see your a new user and i hope you do well on here. ,0

18805, february utcif the point is that warren and his church are viewed as controversial in some circles and that some substantial clear particularly to those unfamiliar with the american cultural stew from which this springs additional detail should be added to the articles both here and at rick warren to reflect that then that should be argued. otherwise all this blather over savages latest addition to the english language is a waste of time its a poor surrogate that avoids mention of such substantive issues. i think it reflects accumulated fatigue from the long arguments over past unsuccessful proposed changes. ,0

18823,i think the whole section of impact of attacks should be removed. while a nice side note for some general hash knowledge it really doesnt provide any critical or significant knowledge. one can mention in another section how some hashes use colored chalk or other products besides white flour due to security concerns in certain areas of the world/united states after anthrax scares in . that would take a single sentence and make the readability much better. i also removed the section regarding how to get started since the syntax and grammar were poor and difficult to read. please take the time to critically go over what you write. entire sections really are not needed when one or two sentences can convey the same information. regarding the popularity of the hash and the internet something like that seems quite subjective and thus eligible for removal. i learned about hashing through a friend but would likely not be nearly as involved if not through internet lists and sites however it doesnt men the internet itself made it more popular any more than magazines subscriptions for people that are probably already likely hashers makes a difference in itself. mblitch,0

18827,hi red when you get a chance take a look at the charles e. bassett article. ive addressed just about all of the suggestions that you have made at least up to this point. it may require further tweaking here and there but i think youll find my latest version very much closer to what you hand in mind. while i have your attention i had an idea that you might be able to assist with since your technical chops are undoubtedly better than mine. in short is it possible to move the dodge city peace commission photo from its current location blow it up to a larger size and place that enlarged photo so that it is placed in what is currently a large blank space next to the table of contents? i think it would make a far more attractive page. i probably should mention that prior to turning to writing fulltime i worked for several years as a corporate art director who specialized in page layouts. let me know what you think about the idea. also let me know if there are any remaining issues with the bassett article that you think should be addressed. im sure we can work together. ,0

18858, february utci still believe that ravens fate is resting on disney. disney made her a star again adn now she is leaving them which makes me think that after thats so raven has aired the finale and died down a little raven wont get any work again. shell be right where she started before she won the lead on tsr.also so you also believe that lw is coming to an end? because i personally do. and i think that you implied that.finally i think that the group did all depend on each other but personally i am hoping that hollywood records will let the cheetahs become mainstream and not keep them in disney forever like raven. i also think that the group can be mainstream successful without raven but they will have to work hard to do that. hopefully their new single will do good and sell albums for the girls. ,0
18859,it should be a good season but i dont like the devils moves. haha. losing brian rafalski scott clemmensen and scott gomez though gomez was grossly overpaid by the rangers and gaining dainius zubrus whom ive heard isnt bad but isnt great kevin weekes whom doesnt look too good statwise karel rachunek and vitaly vishnevski. it doesnt seem weve upgraded much during this offseason thus far. though we do have some promising young athletes such as zach parise so this could be a very good season. the devils have lost a lot of talent before and still played well this season probably wont be any different. talk ,0

18863,logicus to david wilson david thanks for this useful advice re the ‘request quote’ tag but i do not understand your analysis here and it seems to me you may have confused the de soto citation case with the jovian moons citation case. another dog’s breakfast maybe ? the good reason to doubt the de soto freefall claim was grant’s claim that he predicted uniform acceleration in a homogeneous medium. the good reason to suspect the jovian moons case was simply that it is nonsense. they only support epicyclical astronomy in general whether geocentric or heliocentric. elementary my dear wilson however i do note from your quotations provided elsewhere in talkgalileo galilei that drake did indeed make this silly logical error one of the many that render his conclusions about galileo utterly unreliable.,0

18868,so although you are well aware that vampires versus zombies sucked mightily you consider it vandalisation to use the word shoddy to describe it and would rather keep this info a secret from the users of wikipedia? something which is badly constructed be it a chair a bed a matchbox a bridge a spaceship or a film could be described as shoddy. so what is pov about describing a film in particular as badly constructed especially if there is a near total critical conscensus on this point? i have given the references it is not just my own imho. and by the way accusing other editors of vandalisation does not make you cool either in the eyes of your epeers.,0
18869,im not sure and will think about it. im doubt anything could be written about the snpu that we couldnt fit into the svoboda article and so i tend to agree with you. i would also argue that many not all of the changes were superficial multiple academic sources describe these as cosmetic and intended to improve the partys image but not its underlying ideology. im guessing youd disagree with this.nevertheless we might all agree that farright politics are in flux right now in ukraine and i wouldnt be surprised if many go the most farright elements around svoboda are now attracted to right sector. isnt it true that the socialnational assembly and patriots of ukraine were originally groups that came from the transformation of the snpu into svoboda? now these groups helped form right sector.i think the svoboda article could be improved by writing about all of this and incorporating the snpu material as well. itll be easier a year from now when more academic material has been written about the current situation in ukraine. ,0
18870,glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” or “sky” and it backtranslates “heaven” as ezman. some definitions from merriamwebster unabridged heaven. . a. especially the expanse of space that seems to be over the earth like a great dome — usually used in plural. . a. the place of the blessed dead. earth. . a. soil ground. . the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven hell. sky. . b. the expanse of space appearing as a great vault over the earth. . heaven def. — often used in plural. tremble. . to shake involuntarily as with fear cold excitement fatigue. these two expressions are good idiomatic english “if his wrath is aroused the skies will tremble in fear.” “if his wrath is aroused the heavens will tremble in fear.” here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken english only in mediocre written english. so we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations “ypg is goes walking and the earth and the skies tremble.” “ypg is goes walking and the earth and the heavens tremble.” if you try speaking them aloud you may find that this one sounds best a. “ypg goes walking and the earth and heavens tremble.” something about the meter the cadence just makes it sound liks a military motto. the presentprogressive clause “ypg is walking” would naturally correlate with the presentprogressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” but we want to use simple present tense in the second clause. see above. to do so a native english speaker would begin with “ypg goes walking ” because it combines both tenses simple present and present progressive. but see whether you can come up with a bettersounding combination,0

18897, wikimedia blog post hello everyone. trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning. i hope i wont be smited for pointing something out again. the current wikimedia foundation blog post is wikipedia for schools project. the blog talks about how wikipedia for schools was born out of sos children. its a great project providing underprivileged kids in the third world with curated ageappropriate content from wikipedia. but when you go to see who wrote the wikipedia articles about the organization and the program one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflictofinterest accounts. two days ago a big chunk of content was added to sos childrens villages uk by userrwilcox. rainbow wilcox happens to be website content editor at sos children. no disclosure by rwilcox so if that is indeed ms. wilcox the edits are in violation of the wikimedia foundations terms of use of this site. similarly on monday the day the new terms of use went into effect user was working on the article. rory hughes social media marketer for sos children. in a bit of contrast userjamieg identifies himself on his talk page as follows i work for an international childrens charity called sos children so we can assume this is jamie goodland who received special thanks in the wmf blog post. likewise userduncanharris identifies on his user page i am entirely responsible for the technical work on the schools wikipedia selection. this work was funded by sos children uk part of the worlds largest orphan charity. and userbozmo identifies as andrew cates on his user page with i also worked from part time as ceo for the charity sos children.might i make a recommendation? now that the new terms of use is coming up on its first week of implementation maybe someone from the wikimedia blog staff could make it a point that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant wikipedia article that part of the bloggers responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject to ask them to selfidentify per the new terms of use so that the wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the terms of use of the foundations project. to do my part i will be happy to reach out now to users rwilcox and to let them know of this conversation. so it would be nice if it isnt deleted or hatted. ,0

18904, exo interestingly enough i have added such a section and have since added the stats in a more neutral edit in the kinect section of the articlemy edit as followsxbox one gets to know you. it learns what you like and what you don’t. and brings it all together on your own personal home screen. and because every xbox one comes with kinect it responds naturally to your voice movements and gestures. the xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience. the kinect sensor detects when you are smiling crying angry or bored. every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood. even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark. ive worked on several versions of this and our self titled edit dictator has been telling me it is not neutral or that i am implying something. then he changes his argument to saying that i am duplicating information how is information duplicated when what i add is not there in the first place?you my friend are well advised to spread the word about the bias and censorship here that is especially prevalent in the xbox one article spread the word bias is used to remove pertinent information dissent/criticism is silenced and you are told that you are the one not being neutral when adding to the article.last time i checked almost every major article on wikipedia has not just links to its subtopics but either short clips or brief summaries from the subtopic article pages added into the main article.apparently here in xbox one it is different.double standards continue to be enforced and trust me this information is neutral. these are facts. exo ,0
18905,i think this is a brilliant and wholly appropriate idea. people have evidently begun creating accounts in a serial fashion using them only for a day or two without much or any talkpage use to avoid comparisons of writing style and such to other presumably puppetmaster accounts. wikipedia really has no defense against this except for the tedious process of manually reverting probable socks on sight which burns opponents re rr restrictions and runs the risk also of one being accused of biting newcomers. id be wholly in favor of giving this a go in this case and would happily support the attempt at the appropriate wpae page. what do you say?  –  ,0

18927,oh lord spare us. your side makes out that its just a slur aimed at the israeli government and then you complain that its also used for other zionists lots of people call expansionists zionists not just neonazis and islamists although they are well represented as doing so on google. and few people would use the phrase zionist terrorists who arent so describing the government and armed forces of israel and its true that the combination is unlikely to be much seen in mainstream work because its rare that governments of any kind are described as terrorists in mainstream publications. but the phrase is used and it is used by people outside those mentioned. and its not necessarily true that it has fallen into disrepute more original research you simply will not source any of this stuff will you? so much as it has never been much used. i dont doubt that. there are relatively few zionist terrorists. given the nature of terrorism thats hardly a surprise. there arent many american terrorists either. ,0
18928,the problem is that you judge this as bullshit but the guy who posted it evidently didnt. so its your opinion against his. its rude to presume that you are in the right to such a degree that nobody else should be allowed to read what he wrote we dont need you to censor our incoming mail for us if you delete that material then you are denying the rest of us the right to make up our own minds and either a support his view b suggest ways to compromise or c point out where hes wrong. as wptalk says editing – or even removing – others comments is sometimes allowed. but you should exercise caution in doing so and normally stop if there is any objection. this is a pretty rare thing. if its bullshit then other rightthinking editors will agree with you. you say it annoys me having to read it but you had to read it before deleting it so thats an entirely bogus argument. so please dont delete other peoples post again except perhaps in the most egregious circumstances and only after some discussion on the talk page. ,0

19009, team roster moved from user talkkevin mcehi there. i wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited wpcrystal. im not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate. thanks. i dont know what needs to be explained. we cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year because we do not know the future. an encyclopaedia reports facts not expectations. hi again. firstly i moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow. i am still not clear exactly what at wpcrystal makes this content inappropriate. this is not a predicted team roster it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of team sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for and then that not happening must be very slim. it is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year that is in the preceding paragraph and i would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that. a roster not a word that should be used on an article about a uk subject but that is a different matter is not something that exists in and even as a speculative list it is so incomplete as to be meaningless it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles but these are not the point. returning to the crystal balling issue you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact. lets hope it doesnt happen but sky might go bust or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury before january in which case will arrive they will not be part of the team and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error. facts not expectation. i will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in doesnt mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in and that the team might not even exist. however all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in that makes them part of the squad for . were not simply expecting them to be they are confirmed to be. surely though we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. i think you are misinterpreting wpcrystal. id suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable as is the case here. if it turns out that any or all of these riders dont ride for team sky in then the wikipedia article wont have been guilty of having recorded an error because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available. im not saying that it wont happen nor that it is not very likely but that it is expectation not fact. you speak of verifiability but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable. if they were to die before the end of this year they will not be in the team the future is not confirmed. an entirely accurate description of something that does not currently exist is not possible and as a description a man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate. i find your position on this matter a little strange. you seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. the names that are being announced are for the squad so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. we can and should only base the article on what can be verified at the current time and that is that the riders named are part of the team for . the information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in and our article is and should only ever be based upon information available at the time. i would note that not only has another user reverted the change you made which i am concerned about here but also that a further ten names have been announced,0

19023,if/when you were going to do some updates another one is to change categorynational register of historic places in washington to categorynational register of historic places in washington u.s. state in new articles. apparently the former worked previously but was cfded.also there are a number of new valid architecture categories based on nris architecture categories which could be added such as categoryearly commercial architecture categorybungalow/craftsman architecture categorylate th and th century revivals architecture and categorylate th and early th century american movements architecture that i have been sharing about at wikipedia talkwikiproject national register of historic placesnew nrhpspecific architecture categories where ebyabe also shared. some of the newly valid ones now being redirects / covered at architectural style national register of historic places.i bet others would have suggestions/requests too if you let others know you might do some updating. your tools have been tremendously useful to me and to others.about previous stuff what i understand mostly is that you have not liked me or others generating minimal stub articles unless a certain threshold of development or need is met a threshold that you set differently than i have. i dont want to reopen anything like an argument but i wonder if you think listarticles ive been working on recently are good or bad. these are about fraternal organization buildings list of odd fellows buildings and others linked in its see also section and also list of ymca buildings and list of ywca buildings. i think they serve a good purpose broadly like the nrhplisted bridge lists do and i have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front. i think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks. i think ive had a lot more cumulative experience now good and bad with dealing with disambiguation or masonic or connecticut or otherfocused editor groups and i think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better often than leaving open redlinks. it certainly helps in establishing good categories right away and also ive seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings. doing all of a certain type at once seems beneficial. you can comment or not but i just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation if you considered the prettygood immediately stable listarticles of these sort that ive been making. anyhow hope you are doing well in your other activities. thanks,0
19024,mareklug i watched an interesting documentary downloaded from youtube titles air crash investigation pilot error where this issue is debated in more detail. i believe that the crash of air france flight also raised concerns about the ability of commercial pilots manual flying skills especially when the automated systems shut down. i have also watched the investigation from turkish airlines flight where gordon bethune a former vp at boeing states that the pilots main job is to fly the airplane they must never forget it never mind what a computer says.as the pilots have survived this crashthey should be able to tell the investigators a great deal about what happened. i just hope it isnt turkish airlines all over again.,0

19042,i dont have a complete answer for you. the to the configuration do not appear to have broken anything and should do what your edit summaries indicated you desire. my experience is that cluebot iii cb will sometimes take a while days to either begin making archive edits on a page or act on changes to a configuration. as you can see from the it took cb days to start making archives from when i initially added the configuration template on that page. i have not looked at the code for the bot to see why this is the case but it is what happens from the outside looking in. my assumption has been that in order to reduce the load on the servers it does not look at every page each time it runs. even though it has been about hours since you made the change to reduce the lets give it a bit more time. if cb does not pick up the change in the near future we can switch to,0

19046, northern cyprus edits i will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many northern cyprusrelated articles.i oppose however to your sneaky removal of links to cyprus / island of cyprus / republic of cyprus usually replacing them with links to northern cyprus sometimes even making double or triple links to nc to avoid linking to the island of / republic of cyprus. i also notice that all your newly created articles about places in nc do not have any mentions at all about roc not even the de jure/de facto distinction. that is definitely pov editing.i oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the turkish invasion of cyprus replacing any mention with the events of or your new favorite the hostilities of . these euphemisms do not give any information to the user of wikipedia they only create questions which events? which hostilities?. you have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the ínvasion. these edits are definitely disruptive pov edits.in your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content you only mention additions of mayors population figures etc. which are obviously good additions. the disruptive edits i have mentioned above are never mentioned which is why i used the word sneaky. to make it even worse you are using false edit summaries. when you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary syntax it is not only disruptive it is plain dishonest.in a weeks time i will again be able to edit regularly in wikipedia and i will then begin to revert your pov edits. in the meantime you could help by reverting your worst pov edits. if not the least you can do is to refrain from any more pov edits with dishonest edit summaries.i really think that it would be possible for us to work together to create a neutral wpnpov presentation of places in nc but that would require that you are willing to accept that your personal pov is not necessarily the only way to describe the world. regards ,0

19057,on reflection im not sure this does actually belong in the lead. i dont know if i would call activist a judgmental word but i see jmundos point. it is a somewhat inflammatory word. to many esp. conservatives activist is an insult. i think activist is a fair factual description of some of sotomayors activities at princeton and to a lesser extent at yale but without the context that is present later in the article the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be i.e. sitins protests sstyle activism militancy that sort of thing. thats not what you mean by the word in this context but the reader wont know that before reading the full article which is getting pretty long. also its not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway. theres a lot of stuff in the article thats arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life especially at yale where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there. what do you think? if you really wanted to keep this in the lede perhaps the wording could be changed e.g. she was an advocate for the hiring of latino faculty at both schools or something like that. but im not sure it belongs. ,0

19059, tedious look this courtesy police thing is very tedious your first warning was in the context of a pretty mild remark where i happened to use the word disingenuous in reference to someones argument. in this case im sure i didnt respond particularly appropriately but the whole thing is irritating. its particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot. and also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense. i havent corrected it any further because pd thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it so i assume it will be deleted so im not going to bother with fixing it but really the whole thing is absurd. i notice you say that the images copyright status cannot be corroborated. that is obvious nonsense. pd thor the one who noticed its supposed unsourcedness managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the us government website and reupload it. about two minutes of searching on the us census website i think pretty much brings it up. it is also identical to or so other county maps present on wikipedia most of which i think are sourced. so yeah this is technically unsourced. but a little common sense should tell anyone that its obviously pd and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it. the whole way images are dealt with on wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating. at any rate any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment. im not interested in hearing from you about this subject and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct. i will strive as always to avoid personal attacks. i am sure that on occasion my emotions will get the better of me and i will screw up. if you are concerned about such further instances feel free to report me to the proper authorities or what not. i will add that i dont see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here. when i was promoted to administrator at least the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion. whether or not i sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities i am fairly certain that i have never abused my authority as an administrator which i almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves. i dont think i have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page. there was at least one incident where i was accused of protecting a page inappropriately but i think that was at least arguably justified. so i feel like im pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator and try hard not to abuse that power. the idea that i have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that i do not hold. best ,0

19102,for the record below is the controversial text which these morons think needs citationsthe coyote canis latrans or prairie wolf also interbreeds with dogs and many americans have dogs which are part coyote. the coyote is very closely related to the wolf and the two can be made to interbreed but they never do in the wild. most dog/coyote hybrids are in the domestic population where the father is the coyote responding to a female dog in estrus and the puppies are born into captivity. the word coydog was coined in the eastern us when coyotes began to appear there as they seemed larger than western coyotes and it was assumed that they were dog/coyote hybrids. dna evidence has shown however that this is not the case. the golden jackal is another wild wolflike canid which can interbreed with dogs and it has been crossed with dogs by russian breeders to created the sulimov dog.any species of the canis genus has chromosomes and can interbreed with dogs. these include all varieties of the wolf the golden jackal the coyote the dingo and the new guinea singing dog. the only chromosome canid which is not thought to have contributed to the dog gene pool is the african wild dog which is in a separate genus. however the vast majority of the dna in dogs comes from the various canis lupus varieties. yellow jackals have chromosomes and dont interbreed well with dogs and other wild canids such as the bush dog the maned wolf and the fox have different chromosome sets and cannot interbreed with dogs at all so they played no part in the dog ancestry. see canid hybrid.finally the origin of the dog is so ancient that many nowextinct varieties of wolf some unknown may have played a part. it is wrong to say that dogs descended from modern wolves. they descended from ancestral wolves and this difference must always be kept in mind. ancestral wolves of many varieties existed all over the planet and were most likely domesticated in many places during a period of thousands of years and some of these ancestors are now extinct. this helps in explaining the different morphological groupings of dog as each group may have derived from a different variety of wolf. the common belief that greyhounds and other shorthaired dogs descended from modern gray wolves of norhtern climates and lost their undercoat through human breeding is weak compared to the argument that these breeds descended from a shorthaired wolf of warmer climate. the arabian wolf for example has short hair suited for its climate,0

19110,july in insurance you have contributed some potentially useful information but have phrased it as an argument with the contributions of other editors. that type of discourse is normally reserved for the talk pages with the article itself reserved for consensus information on the topic. evidently there is a lack of consensus on the use of call centers in the insurance business and a need for further discussion. there are two main approaches that are usually taken in this case edit the article to include your information and see if anyone objects and/or reverts your edits and then discuss it in the talk pages or start a discussion in the talk pages first. since your contribution contradicts a previous editors contribution. i will edit both to include both views so the article does not contradict itself. please feel free to open a discussion in the talk pages.,0

19121,e/cissues such as poor design or fireproofing serve only to distract from the key question. even if the buildings were badly designed even if the fireproofing was substandard even if the relevant floors of the wtc buildings were packed floortoceiling with explosives it was still the impacts of the planes that began the process that ended with collapse. the good faith interpretation is that some editors think the collapse process is important enough to be covered in the lead of the toplevel article on the attacks. i dont but i would bow to consensus if it disagreed with me. talkstalk ,0
19122,september utcone of the great things about bayesian stats is that you can do things directly rather than indirectly as in frequentist stats. for example in frequentist stats you cant attach a probability to a hypothesis so you cant talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. instead you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis which is not really what you want. bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle though the sums may get hard in practice. you attach a prior probability to the hypothesis multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it. the point i was making was that probabilities of zero and one make poor choices as priors. i am not saying that bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities just when they are used as priors. your mention of linear models and so on suggests that you are thinking in terms of bayesian methods of parameter estimation whereas i was thinking in terms of bayesian hypothesis testing. ,0

19131,i am reasonably but not totally happy with it. i feel that it is slightly unfair to the subject since it implies that this is merely his estimate. his estimate would seem to derive from the estimates of others so i am not sure why it needs to be described in a way that implies it is quite this subjective. personally i dont believe it is even necessary to state a number in the opening line. i would suggest something such as the following christopher michael langan born c. is an american autodidact. he is wellknown for claims by himself and others that he has scored extremely high on iq tests. billed as by some accounts... the smartest man in america.... etc. possibly this is not perfect either. ,0

19155,here is the problem that i have with this. they built a structure before benjamin franklin. nowhere in my own indepdnent research is there any substantiative proof that contends that when this tower was built in russia it was specificially intended to strike lightning. they might have built a lightning rod. however that very well was not their intention thus not realizing what they accomplished.in order to claim an invention one has to conceive of the initial and original idea. and that is exactly what benjamin franklin did in with his kite experiments and work in electricity. also i stand by my point that the citation/reference being used is quite unacceptable. this is english wikipedia and not russian wikipedia. a reader of this pae should not have to have the text translated thereby setting themselves up for misinterpretation of what is being claimed. until this russian claim can be defended which it is not it is dubious due to the points i have made up above. ,0

19221, some things to note about stalin . many and most photos of stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. he was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. he had a number of betterlooking doubles standins to serve in pr opportunities. he used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.. it is a commonly held opinion in eastern europe i think it is a fact that josif dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. he used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws forcing people to stand and deliver.. isnt it strange the stalin wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship or anything that starts with dict at all according to ies search? political correctness should not run amok especially considering this is english language wikipedia and us people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education so it is easy to indoctrinate them by kind ol uncle joe babble. or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a dictator per definitionem? most of stalins actions were clearly outside the realm of politics which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the peoples will.. did stalin murder his wife? has this issue been settled conclusively?. hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in budapest during the revolutionregards tamas feher from hungaryetomcat,0

19249,i see your concern a better article is what i am concerned about too. ive dealt with numerous kinds of text i know well about text structuring and an aspect drawing my attention striking is the linear style of the narrative and the aseptic surgical? tone with onesided arguments piled up one after the other as a cv resumée can be failing to present the real extent of his actions not presenting critical approaches to his work or positions despite his being severely critized by many reputed authors and groups quite a lenghty criminal record is alleged. formal rigidity covers up the real content wasnt that actually what the pentagon papers were about? just wondering... i share your concern with the cohesiveness the paragraph i embedded refers to the vietnam war context when he was in charge and is intended to clear up what his profile is both at the specific moment and in general as a person and dont intend to delete his medals/merits from the article but offer a critical and balanced approach in the argument completely different subject? well it is directly related to the matter so the reader can get the whole picture. a domestic issue? yes and no the course of events at home were eventually to prompt the usa pullout so both are interacting. i accept suggestions anyway for another collocation or section for the paragraph in question. thank you for mending ellsberg may not be a highranking official and needs a fix there may be a proper word i am not familiar to midranking official? ill look into it. topsecret of course they were. the quotes are telling i cited what the papers revealed so that the reader gets the picture. my claim of not editing is just a mirror of your claim. like you i have a clear position as to the kind of figure and person kissinger is but i do not intend to make an article based on my point of view just to balance it and offer a more realistic picture of the person in question reality is dirtier so to say. as i told before this is not a cv. ,0

19268, some notes hi amoruso in regards to your edits on palestinian refugee and palestinian exodus i want to ask you for a favor. while i dont agree that katz is as neutral a source as you claim im usually not one to advocate censorship on wikipedia. however you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point i.e. showing your sourced pov that you want to convey without endless quotes from one rather biased source. the problem i have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of antipalestinian quotes that intentionally or not turn the article into a hate blog. again while i admit i dont agree with your analysis as i think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization i am not asking you to remove it. what i am asking is that you make your point concisely neutrally i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way if that makes sense and in an encyclopedic manner. endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material. there are much better proper and neutral ways to make your point. thanks talk p.s. i noticed a new article western wall tunnel in which you used a haaretz article by akiva eldar as proof that arafat incited riots. that article says nothing of the sort and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as evidence that arafat was trying to get out of a dead end. it would be helpful to make that small section both accurate and npov. thanks. talk ,0

19271,opening bias in the opening segment if thats what you call it i mean the first content before the table of contents there is the following paragraphthe conflict killed at least people mostly lebanese citizens severely damaged lebanese civil infrastructure and displaced approximately one million lebanese and – israelis. after the ceasefire some parts of southern lebanon remained uninhabitable due to israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.it is blatantly obvious how antiisraeli this paragraph is. the information might be true and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is but the way in which it is organized especially in the opening segment is ridiculously biased. a reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment and then get the following information israel killed many lebanese citizens lebanese civil infrastructure which means hospitals roads etc. was destroyed by israel israel displaced twice as much lebanese civilians and they used cluster bombs which render some lebanese area uninhabitable.completely biased. completely antiisraeli. completely ridiculous. completely unacceptable of a wikipedia article especially a good article.i recommend either changing the wording maybe removing mostly lebanese citizens lebanese and changing it to approximately . million people displaced as well as completely omitting the last sentence. the entire paragraph could be removed entirely with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.and full disclosure i am currently leaving in israel but i would be writing this irregardless of my current location biased articles are biased articles globally. i was not influenced by my current country.,0

19274, that sounds like a great idea. thank you. talk jun utc re vfd bot assistant when you get to the actual closing process im not sure i know what could be safely automated. so many of the decisions require multiple steps. but i may not be the right person to ask. i tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions. i suspect that i see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of simple decisions. ill give it some thought though. am i correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread? if so what parameters would have to be fed in? how complex would it be to initiate the bot? would it be a different bot for keep decisions vs delete decisions?the essential steps for a keep decision are close the discussion page {{substvt}} and {{substvb}} i suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{substvtreason}} remove the vfd header from the page which usually follows the naming convention of the vfd discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together add a boilerplate comment to the articles talk page with a link to the discussion. i usually put the nomination date on the talk page but the closure date is probably close enough.if the vfd discussion has the same name as the article a simple keep decision might be automatable with a single parameter. keep as merge transwiki etc. would still require extra steps.the essential steps for a delete decision are check the articles history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order close the discussion page as above but the reason is often much more detailed sometimes check what links here and move or delete all those links delete the pageim not sure i see how to automate that process. there are too many variables. ill keep chewing on it though. thanks again. ,0

19277,agreed with below. this page serves to reveal the methods behind many classic gaffed effects in card magic. it would be better to removing the parts that contain method and simply stick to what effect the deck accomplishes. magicians in the online community have become used to exposures on youtube and other sites but an easily searchable database of text explanations greatly reduces the barrier for an interested party to find the method. wikipedia should not just aggregate all the methods in magic as fewer people would benefit from the knowledge beginners etc than would suffer professional magicians kids etc.,0
19278,so just to be clear... did you take any action against those wikipedia users who labeled another user as a terrorist stalker and criminal without any supporting factual evidence and without having contacted the authorities? im very confused about how things work on wikipedia. it appears that its okay to call other people names that are in no way nice but if someone mentions that this sort of behavior could be considered i wont say the word but it starts with the letter l and it rhymes with bible that is an indef blockable offense? are you taking sides in the matter and challenging only the afterthefact legal threats? or have you been equal in counseling restraint among those who use inflammatory labels to malign other users? ,0

19309,hey there ill be glad to clarify what i mean. there are a few problems i have with the site and not in and of itself actually it looks pretty good and says the same things i would say. first it appears to be a fansite which is not considered reliable enough for use as a source in wikipedia. this also includes for external links as the usual case for someone posting such a site here is to promote and drive traffic to it. second this type of information belongs in a travel guide which is something wikipedia is not. i would actually suggest this site for something like wikitravel. again its not a bad site but its inappropriate here. i would have no problem mentioning this site on the articles talk page and if consensus wants it in there then so be it.i do apologize for using the template as i do know the general guideline is dont use template warnings for regular contributors. that said i do hope this makes my reasoning a bit clearer. please feel free to message me again if you have any questions or additional concerns. thank you for your contributions and happy new year au ,0
19310,=proposal that a new people who have been accused of antisemitism category be created===as ive already written above i oppose placing gibsons bio in the antisemitic people category because he vigorously denies the charge and listing him as such without qualification is tantamount to calling him a liar. antisemitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge and wikipedia should categorically label a person as antisemitic only in cases where the person either admits to being antisemitic or admits to holding unquestionably antisemitic views. gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges. i do however sympathize with people who continue to add the antisemitic people tag to his page. i therefore propose the creation of a new category called people accused of antisemitism. the category would be for people who face or have faced substantiated charges of antisemitism from respected sources. substantiated charges would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge as opposed to a my best friends roommate told me accusation and respected sources would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating antisemitism civil rights organizations like adl and splc come to mind. this new category would allow wikipedia to associate the antisemitism controversy with gibsons article without actually leveling the charge that he is antisemitic. thoughts? ==,0

19321, re farmsanctuary images thank you for the compliment for calling me the image master though i would disagree and say there are others around here that are much more knowledgeable about images and policy. but anyways i only found images that he uploaded most were just uploaded over an existing file. i couldnt find a source for imagegene baur and imagegene baur so you can see the better source request tag i put on there and notified the use to provide a better source for the images. the main confusion is that if you look at this image page and it will state please feel free to use this image with credit to farm sanctuary. but if you click on the click here for a high resolution tif they state not to use for commercial uses which would be incompatible with our policy. also confusing in the matter the user has a username that implies they are a part of this organization along with their userpage that states as such. the image on their userpage was uploaded by someone else though who is interested in the same topics and has few edits anyways. i would say they are the same person. lastly the image on their userpage image has a unique message ive never seen before about otrs that says they gave permission. i asked on irc and the otrs folks said it was only for that image but it seems they would be likely willing to license the others if asked. my guess email the folks at the foundation and ask them to do what they did for the other image for the other images that this user uploaded. you could list them under possible unfree imagedisputed its a bad name using {{puidisputed}} and follow the directions on the tag though i doubt it would get as much attention as i have given it but this is the standard method of dealing with these things i think. ≈talk ,0

19339,i can believe that there are variations in terminology between the states as one of the sources suggests. maybe this is what im misunderstanding does the line run along state boundaries? the article suggests not the sources suggest that the variation is defined by what state a person is in not on which side of the line they find themselves. no not purely on state boundaries. its remarkable that the straight line on the map does the job so well. of course thats an approximation too. the exception to state boundaries is in southern nsw mostly the riverina which is aussie rules country. one can see it by looking at the shapes of footy grounds and goalposts when travelling through that area. even on google maps if you want to do your own research. this is probably due to the fact that it is actually closer to melbourne than sydney and the early rail lines connected to melbourne rather than sydney back in the nineteenth century. wagga and narrandera are boundary towns. broken hill is an aussie rules town actually being closer to adelaide. did you know that broken hill runs on south australian time? of course journalists arent going to go into that sort of detail every time they write about it. the line is wrong for the northern territory. all of the nt is aussie rules territory.,0

19344, only to the audience and planning of angiers shooting can someone please tell me how he recounts his method only to the audience? it seems to me that hes explaining his method directly to borden as he was dying. he tells borden to look where you are and it takes courage to walk in every night not knowing whether i was going to be the prestige or the man in the box paraphrasing. obviously he doesnt play a video to borden showing him exactly what we the audience see but it was pretty clear to me that these clips were meant to be explanatory not only to the audience but in a sense to borden as well. the phrasing included below makes it sound like borden never finds out how angier did the trick.similarly flashbacks recount only to the audience angiers method that each time he disappeared during his illusion he fell into a locked tank and drowned and the machine created a duplicate who teleported to the balcony and basked in the applause.also having just watched the film again it seems to me that cutter colludes with borden to allow borden in to kill angier so that angier can reunite with his daughter who he earlier recommends that she needs her father. cutter leaves lord caldlows estate disgusted as he has stolen bordens daughter and helped frame him for murder. i assume that he resolved to help fallon/borden to get his daughter back after finding out that lord caldlow was really angier. thoughts? the ending of the film angier is still alvie. this is the reason for caines v.o. asking the audience to see it now if you pause the dvd you will actually see an air bubble rise int he water. how am i the only one who see this? i will keep changing this page till people understand this. thank you —preceding unsigned comment added by ... please review the archive links at the top of this page. we discussed this when the film was originally released. — talk so what are you suggesting? an angier hid in a water tank held perfectly still and held his breath for a at least good minutes... for what? if there is an air bubble its probably because jackman needed to breathe... the air bubble is real i saw it twice in the theater and on dvd. i can upload a screen shot from the dvd with the air bubble if necessary. the point is other editors have argued that this doesnt mean anything however what bothers me is this the nolans are really good at what they do. if we saw the air bubble then you can bet they saw it and if it was a mistake it would have been digitally removed. the fact that they left it in the film is very interesting and nicely parallels the end of the novel itself. on the other hand it doesnt make sense. the angier floating in the tank is clearly dead and has no way of getting out. — talk plot ending in the plot description of this page it states that the film ends with borden eyeing the water traps containing the dead duplicates of angier. however when i saw the film and i may be mistaken in this it seemed as if the trap shown immediately before the credits contained a living angier. this fact was further emphasized when the camera panned away from the burning theatre and to the body of angier which had wide open eyes and appeared to be viewing the scene that had just occurred between hugh jackman and christian bale and the credits roled immediately after he came into full view only showing the body for a second. it may also be that the director included this to leave the audience guessing as to whether or not the body was alive or not and whether angier did in fact have the last laugh. either way a reference to this should be included into the plot summary. —preceding unsigned comment added by talk • contribs keep in mind that like most nolan films the film is nonlinear so the plot summary synthesizes in many areas including the conclusion. this format isnt de rigueur and improvements are always welcome as long as the plot is short and sweet per wpmosfilm. as for whether angier has his eyes open or is alive that is pure speculatio,0

19369,dear sniperz thanks for your help advice. we shall try our best to bring brahmo upto acceptable wiki standards. please keep checking that page every days or so and post on the talk page there. actually there is a distinction between brahmos and brahmo samaj. brahmos refers to adherents members of the brahmo religion whereas brahmo samaj refers to followers of the brahmo samaj qv. hindu code . so whereas all brahmos are brahmo samajis the reverse is not necessarily true and which is why brahmo and brahmo samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places. however this has nothing to do with the brahmos missile and i foresee a disambigunation page for brahmos sometime in the future. cheers. dear bikashwe have to improve the content on the page. add infoboxes images and citations. then we have to check all those spelling and grammatical things. after that we have to find associated brahmo type pages and add links from those pages to this article so that interested people can start editing this page. sniperz point about brahmo and brahmo samaj commonalities / differences has to be brought out so the pages are not merged. bikash please create a wiki user identity. ,0

19393,i actually was never carrying an id while walking down the streets in russia in most cases this is not needed and it is not compulsory by law. if you travel by train or air you must have an id with you but in the usa you also need an id to travel by air do not you? the police have the right to request your id only if you are a crime suspect. i believe this is the same in the usa isnt it? the problem is that this right is easy to abuse. in russia especially in bigger cities policemen can claim you resemble someone wanted and place you in custody until your identity is determined but not longer than for some time which i do not remember now. they would release you from custody for a small amount of money unofficially paid to them. the problem is thus not in the law but in the improper conduct of policemen. identity cards or passports are compulsory in many countries see listofidentitycardpoliciesbycountry. the usa is more like an exception actually.,0

19445,to respond your points the national council of young israel is i believe the parent body so to speak of that speaks for young israel type jews which is what i meant by calling it branch of judaism. i am not aware of them being an advocacy group. perhaps you can source your statement for that. your personal feelings on their opinions and what you imagine them advocating obviously does not count here. what matters is that they are a notable organization by wp standards while your neighborhood association probably is not and therefore their opinion is notable on wikipedia too. this is in addition to the fact that theyve been cited by a noteworthy newspaper the jewish press. you havent stated why their opinion is not relevant to goldstone himself. while there has been much criticism of the goldstone report which has been covered in that article this criticism is specifically about giving an award to goldstone himself and rightly relevant to an article about him and the awards hes received. the point is that there should be balance in the article with a npov. i dont see why the criticism should be incorporated into the rest of the article and not in its own section specially if there is a section dedicated to his praise. ,0

19462, may utc if the astronomy material is accurate it shouldnt be all that hard to find a source for it. please reread the verifiability policy linked underneath every edit box. this is described as official policy and nonnegotiable. much of this material is valid and valuable folklore transmitted as oral tradition. however wikipedias no original research policy means that wikipedia is not a vehicle for first publication of valid and valuable folklore. talk ,0
19463,im glad asked the question that you are not a wpnewbie is why i made this edit a month ago to see how you would react and is why i am watching your account just like i was watching this recently indefinitely blocked editor. but anyway its not like you are under an official wpsock investigation.,0
19464,lordkazan i am currently looking for suitable citations. but still i feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. you see recently i edited a german article concerning a neonazi brand name deconsdaple. in that article i inserted totally biased ridiculing phrases because i felt that in germany it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from nazism and because i am rather convinced of my eloquence in german although i am certainly not as godlike at it as avi is with english. now with the circumcision article i have a similar dilemma. but my pov here is although not more biased than with the nazi topic not the public pov. and thats what i meant in the circumcision discussion my pov is that there is no npov besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation be it in jewish tradition or whatever. and all that pointing to the respective guidelines by avi or jakew wont change that. but the article does not even feature the word intact which in itself the word and its rejection by the probiased lobby is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. so alright im sancho pansa but do you really believe in playing the game like this? after all jakew doesnt have a problem with the wikipedia guidelines because his personal bias is similar to the american/community bias on the topic of circumcision. ,0

19477,im trying to stay away from article disputes for a while though the page is still on my watchlist and i see youve been very patient there. i wish there were a way to ordain a word limit for this article through some kind of rfc so that there would be an upper limit of the amount of coverage of kleins reporting that could be added. since he is in many controversies coverage of all of them could fill up several articles. the fact that he is a reporter for a publication world net daily that we do not consider a reliable source should theoretically deserve some weight. it seems possible that a recent participant on talk ... may be connected to klein. my only evidence is the pov expressed and the geolocation of the ip. i took a look at wikipediasockpuppet investigations/jerusalem/archive but the only commonality i could see between this ip and the accounts listed there was the editing pattern. it is interesting that jerusalem did wind up with an indef block.,0

19486, reply to no such users opinion not sure if youre able to comprehend but here are few facts to considerserbia was a country during selimovićs life for years before yugoslavia was kingdom of serbia kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes scs was renamed yugoslavia. and it was also one of the federal republics of yugoslavia. this is why on the yugoslav censuses serb ethnicity was an option which selimovic selected. the majority of the members of the partizans and the communists were serbs being a serb and being a partizan/communist was not mutually exclusiveyour implication that he changed nationalities from bosnian to serbian to spite sarajevan harrasment is ridiculous because he was not addressing his nationality in the letter but rather his ethnicity which is an unchangeable characteristic.the serbian languages standardization was devised by karadzic in years before the croatian latin alphabet was standardized by ljudevit gaj and years before serbocroatian was devised at the vienna agreement. if you read mesa selimovics books you would know that the modern standardized serbian language is older than both modern standardized croatian and serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing karadzics reforms. also there are croatian and serbocroatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized serbian that selimovic wrote in namely cakavian and kajkavian.you say biographies are reliable sources. then read this excerpt from selimovics own autobiography sjecanja that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz bosne a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam srbin. pripadam srpskoj literaturi > translation i come from a muslim family from bosnia but by ethnicity i am a serb. i belong to serbian literatureyou are clearly not a sane and neutral editor if you call me a bully and tell me to fuck off simply for adding relevant the authors works deal primarily with ethnic questions in the balkans additional information and citations from the authors own autobiography to an article.,0
19487,furthermore the huffington post source article directly references social media posts in effort to prove a non existent point that there was public acknowledgement of antijapanese sentiment being prevalent in any notable fraction of the public regarding the tsunami disaster. it was bad journalism to the say the least but to take it further its an abhorrent journalistic source when taking in the fact that even the article says some people as in some people think the disaster was payback for pearl harbor while then giving only a few examples of social networking comments. if anything is worth noting about that article its that the author is asian and likely felt some kind of negative emotion after coming across a few of those posts so he abused his publishing power to try to make a mockery of the few examples he cited.,0
19488,i think that is made clear.,0

19490,you are stalin apologets. where is placed the mention of katyin massacre where several thousands of polish povs were shot by nkvd upon stalins personal order? we hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically so i find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of katyin very painful. stalins crimes against poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. there is no excuse to the molotovrippentropp pact. make no mistake that was the hitlerstalin pact.i really wish stalin ruled you not us. you are like rumsfeld who met saddam during mids and praised him as a good ally in the antikhomeini iran war. when will you realize that putyins current rule is an analog of stalins characterized by extreme disregard for law antisemitism most notably the early s doctor trials vs. s khodorkovskiyukos and imperialism brutal military actions in the caucasian mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours. thus by not mentioning stalins criminality in unambigious terms you hold the englishspeaking world blind to putyins methods and you contribute to a new uncle joe sentiment which will inevitable put the world and the poor russian race in great danger. a repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.stalin started his reign with a few million dead by reversing lenins postcivilwar new economic policy of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.the entire wwii in europe would be over in months had stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet armys elite in this is clearly written in vol. . of soviet published sevenvolume the history of the great patriotic war . you are plain stupid to praise stalin for a hard earned victory in wwii.so powerful was the fear of stalins evil power that even us hungarians who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last years did not dare to raise again until autumn to free ourselves from stalinism. anglosaxons betrayed us big time then shame on the free world.in churches renovated after wwii big destruction in hungary the face of the satan as defeated by archangel michael is always of josif stalins on wall paintings. people were shot for painting that.regards tamas feher.,0

19501,i do agree that books that contain the noncatholic view have been consulted my concern and that of other fa reviewers has been in the way that information is presented in this article. the history section should not regurgitate the rccs view of itself but should reflect the main views that scholars have about the rcc. some of us believe that more weight is given to the rcc perspective and that the history section has a slight procatholic pov.,0

19503, this was a tool im so tired of archaeologists interpreting anything they dont understand as simply art. at the very least call it prehistoric crafts because they were actually utilized in some way. in the case of this figure it is a prehistoric fertility dildo. the male deer is coming up behind the female to mount her.it would be used on the female before copulation because of the increased fertility perceived to coincide with female orgasm. note the ridging.archaeologists historically are afraid to openly discuss the sexual nature of prehistoric crafts. this is why so many things are labeled fertility object when they are dildos plain and simple. yes population increases were the larger goal of this. but the female orgasm was proof that some supernatural force had blessed her womb. ... ,0

19511, people know if theyre happy or not. i take offense with the view of some members here that some countries are happier than they should be. to be honest i see nothing wrong with a study that asks people whether theyre happy or not then compiles the results. if people in colombia consider themselves happier than people in russia thats their decision. this index is not a matter of researchers deciding which countries are the happiest then listing their opinions. its the product of surveys of the citizens within those countries if i read the page right.sure you might wonder why the endangered malnourished citizens of colombia are happier than the welleducated protected citizens of russia. nevertheless it does little good to go up to a colombian and say you shouldnt be happy look at all these statistics on your country or approach a russian and say well based on your literacy and your income shouldnt you be happier? people might not know much but they do know whether or not theyre happy. with that in mind i dont see any problems with a study that asks citizens if theyre satisfied with life then compares the responses across countries. ,0

19562,wow. a preemptive attack on an article in preperation for an afd. unfortunately quite miseleading. hope others dont pay it much heed. no evidence of notability of this film. false. notability has been asserted and sourced. further the statement seems to absolutely ignore the sorces provided which in toto amount to enough to meet wpnf and wpgng this week columbus dispatch athens news and abc news all qualify as indepth coverage from reliable sources. no reviews by nationallyknown reviewers or publications. misleading as it does not automatically apply. a cult horror satire film by independent filmmakers is unlikely to be reviewed by siskel and ebert much less those publications that cater to only bigname bigbudget highly touted blockbusters. wikis guideline recognizes that sources may be considered for what is being sourced and accepts that an indepth review of film and filmmakers by cranked on cinema is from experts in the field qualified to voice an opinion about the subject. even the socalled new york times reference is in fact to all movie guide. gee. why mislead with that? the new york times was not used to source notability... neither was the use of turner classic movies. again you are misleading a reader who might best be told that these reliable sources were used to wpverify some of the articles noncontentious facts... like existance of film or of cast crew... which is expected and demanded by guideline and policy... specially since notability has already been established by significant coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject but thanks for the hint about amg... i can now add it as well. the fact that it is the first feature completed by ohio state students is not an indication of notability false as it is for them and quite specifically meets the criteria set by wpgng even though it is only a secondary and supported claim toward overall notability. it is not an assertion that it is the first feature completed by university students would there be an automatic bypass of notability requirements for the first feature completed by students of every college or university? this misleading wpwax argument is not about this article... only about some hypothetical article. the sourced minor assertion is that this is the first for ohio university. not for any others. why not handle those article if/when they show up? there is no request being made here for a bypass of notability requirements for some other mythical set of as yet unwritten articles. notability here has been asserted and proven. period. michael q. ,0

19565,no i didnt say it didnt exist i just meant to point out that the kind of objectivity you are imposing on our edits and discussions makes little sense when the person were discussing could quite probably be our old school friend or our grandmothers neighbour not because we are deliberately exploiting a coi but because it couldnt be otherwise. even trying to protect the anonymity of research participants is kind of farcical in a small population. in light of our culture i think your rules about objectivity are antagonistic assuming youre not some mutant kind of new zealander that is. and i wouldnt be surprised if someone makes a bigger deal out of your behaviour.,0

19580, hi there my block expired a few hours ago and i wanted to ask you if you had the chance to review the case. as i understand it i was blocked for wpnpa after stating several times the editor wee curry monster was making untrue statements purposely misrepresenting my comments. prior to that i addressed them as lies but after i was advised not to do so in the last ani i stopped. i see now that untrue statements isnt acceptable either. fair enough i shall not use the word lies or untrue statements again. now this raises the obvious question what should i do when this editor purposely makes a misrepresentation of comments/facts in a discussion? i can present the evidence for this editor doing so quite a number of times i actually did at the last ani. id have no problem in assuming good faith if it werent for the fact that he never once either apologized or acknowledged having done so. what should i do as an editor when another editor behaves like this over and over again?also if you have the time could you please drop by the talk page talkfalklandislandssovereigntydispute and the ani report and tell me if you believe editors wee and kahastok are properly interpreting the discussion as to give them consensus to delete the whole section from the article? i know this is a lot of work but ive seriously done everything in my power to address thess issues short of taking both editors to arbcom which i really do not want to do. regards. ,0

19594,factually incorrect information? how many articles from reputable sources do you want that emilio pucci created capri pants?here are just a fewthe unverifiable claims were the ones that i set out to remove from wikipedia the claims that a heretofore unheardof sonja de lennart who was completely unknown on google until december created capri pants.originally there was one site given as a source for the sonja de lennart claims a site owned by eleonora de lennart and created in february . a simple glance at this website will show that it is not a reputable source. instead it was fabricated for the sole purpose of fooling wikipedia.unfortunately the wikipedia hoax was not detected before and other websites picked up the false claim of authorship and it was included in an associated press article that was widely syndicated. the success of the hoax in tricking a reporter is now being used to give the hoax legitimacy.users pchip and delennart have had no other purpose on wikipedia than to spread the false stories about capri pants. your actions in supporting their claims and in blocking the attempt to undo their persistent vandalism are damaging wikipedia.,0

19609, shrug. you can say that for any kingdom. the germanic concept of a kingdom is not a geographic area it is a political area defined by folks not acres. the area often a latin term will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. east franks are a folk germany is an area. lombards are a folk. italy is an area etc. the kingdom of germany refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the east franks and their subject tribes swabians bavarians saxons thuringians etc. which by the thth c. is now settled down into large duchies the royal duchy of franconia plus swabia bavaria saxony etc.. this specific collection of barons acclaim their king who is crowned in aachen usually by the archbishop of mainz almost always. this is the king of germany and the area these barons cover we can call the kingdom of germany. there really is no term more convenient to call him or it. ,0

19644,if that article says its legal the article is incorrect. evidence of this is that italy has issued warrants for the arrest of cia agents who kidnapped an italian citizen. `extradition is the legal process whereby a person may be handed over to a foreign legal system. it involves the case for extradition being presented to a judge. what the cia do is grab someone off the street and ship them abroad for torture. under the law that is kidnap. if members of european security agencies were involved they are also kidnappers under the law. there are several cases of cia extraordinary rendition being investigated across europe at the moment. all are treated as illegal. ... al bin baloney hows my driving?,0

19653,article length is not irrelevant because featured article criteria require that an article is of appropriate length. surely youd agree that if jenna jameson = gandhi then one of them is not of appropriate length? so the question is which one. frankly very very few people will read all of an article thats longer than kb unless its on something of crucial importance to science history or the arts. if you write kb on a canadian regional politician and that is a truly terrible article or kb on a porn star then unfortunately i fear that your time has not been well spent because few people will read the article. if it was kb long it would have a much more enthusiastic readership and you could have written at least five very good kb articles in the time it takes to do one very good kb article.,0
19654, correction ... the munsters were not a relief of melodramtic soap operas such as dark shadows as the later series did not debut until a.d. the only suspense soap opera that could have come close was the edge of night. rather it was more a tongueincheek sendup to the lowbudget horror moviess perliferating in the fifties and sixties. the characters themselves bore this out obviously with sisterthemed show the addams family and competitive sitcoms bewitched and i dream of jeannie this formula became a winning mantra that departed from the typical family situation comedies and droll western series ... veryverser,0

19666, wikipediaarticles for deletion/sergei ivanovich vasiliev hello the article which has been recently put for deletion was kept conclusion – no consensus. however my arguments for a few days were not commented by anyone neither participants of the discussion although it was edited nor administration. i have considered each source used in the article. some were affiliate some nonauthoritative and some did not comply with the wp gng rule significant coverage. i am not in any kind of relations with other participants of the discussion this may be easily checked. do hope for your comments and help. may be it is worth to put an article for deletion again using my arguments and taking in account other peoples opinion? because the conclusion no consensus is not quite right its absence or presence were not demonstrated. arguments were simply ignored. can you give any comments about my arguments? ,0

19668,very well since the word blatant is considered an attack i take it back and apologise for that. still a sock puppet? where did that justification come from? i had to defend myself at the very least and only repeating what shrigley had said in asking him to stop his baseless accusations.,0

19670,i think the discussion is perhaps obscuring the meaning of the concept of taṇhā which seems more like the impulse towards an object rather than desire itself. without desire we would not eat or drink and thus cease to be... without desire as the dalai lama has said there would be no idea of a path or anyone trying to follow one more abstract notions of there being no path aside. taṇhā is therefore its own thing without specific translation in this context but which we all struggle with every moment. that impulse to obtain or avoid which occurs and which is attempted to be fulfilled blindly by those remaining in delusion. so although taṇhā is linked with desire it is not desire nor the object of any desire.. it is that momentary impulse that drives us towards a desire. if we then form our intention around that desire we make ourselves vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. if on the other hand we form intention based upon none of these things and taṇhā is acknowledged but not acted upon then we are less vulnerable.,0
19671,clarification for you and zundarks right i should have checked the wikipedia bugs page first. this is a bug in the code that makes wikipedia work it just means that there is a line of code that may have an error as small as an extra space. its analogous in a very simplified way to trying to make something bold in html and forgetting to put the at the end so youd see something like thiswords in boldinstead of thiswords in bold its not like a virus that is code somebody deliberately wrote in order to infect your computer and damage files so it wont go around. jhk,0
19672,with respect wikipedia works on the basis of consensus and you alone are not in a position to say when the discussion is closed. that said i would have no problem inserting the same words that you quote viz the english army founded in was succeeded in by the new british army into this article to give additional context. i hope that helps. ,0

19686,i would like to start with your inappropriate use of my last name several times. please follow traditions.now i learned about the z++ page in wikipedia from a friend. i thought i could do a better job so i spent time to learn wikis features and expand on the page. as about the google search i have been told about references to z++ mostly in european forums etc. in some cases that i became interested i had to use a translator i was shown how to do that so i could see what was being said about z++. unlike you those folks had looked at the z++ syntax chart and were discussing its features.about the use of .h and namespace your are making a big guess about z++ without first trying to understand what z++ is. you are wrong in guessing that z++ is an extension of c++ the way c++ extends c by porting simula classes. no there is no chance of confusing z++ files with c header files. the notion of namespace is quite extensive in z++. please read more carefully before commenting.you are wrong in guessing that z++ is in competition with c++. it is not nor i care what c++ can or cannot do. however in order to provide a perspective for illustrating ideas one has to make references to other known implementations. c++ is such a minimal subset of z++ that i can simply use c simula ada eiffel and apl in order to provide context for understanding the contributions of z++ to software development. but then c++ includes c and simula and is known to many.mr. best had your request for deletion not followed our discussion in the googles c++ newsgroup i would have assumed that you are sincere and would have tried to clarify any confusion. you are simply doing this and improperly using my last name for what happened there. please indicate some inconsistency within z++ language or explain how you think z++ is in competition with c++ rather than expressing your dislike. for your information z++ can link with c++ dynamic libraries for soa. there is no competition between z++ and any other language. but there is no reason not to provide a comparison as seen suitable.,0

19695,i’m not saying you have to include everything but the quote from the guardian was more so positive than neutral. and no you don’t have to include the full quote but if you are going to talk about that particular quote then you should at least get enough what it was saying. cause they didn’t say “she wasn’t duly stretched” they said “one can say she wasn’t duly stretched” they also added this part to it. “knightley brings to the role fine sculpted features palpable intelligence and a nice mix of fauxinnocence and flirtiness. even if she doesnt always know what to do with her hands she gives a perfectly creditable performance” if you want to go for neutrality then you should’ve added that part as well. i mean it’s still a neutral opinion and it still reflects the whole “generally positive” part. also in talks of contrasting that bit you should add more to the quote quinten letts made in the daily mail. which stated that she had the charisma of a gold fish.so you have the positive with the negative. this doesn’t take away from the neutrality. if anything it shows just how neutral the opinions were. ...,0

19697, triple crown and grand slam champions i am not and was never looking to start trouble all i am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.the triple crown and the grand slam are what we have been going back and forth on.my contention is that the intercontinental and united states championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a crown/slam.you say no because wwe never explicitly came out and said so.on jbl said he was a slam winner. a wwe wrestler on wwe tv said he accomplished a wwe sanctioned feat.it was said that no outside source has verified this but no one in wwe has disputed jbls claim either.also it must be pointed out that pwi has always considered the two championships as equal.when pwi used to do their rankings for wwf and wcw the ic and u.s. titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective world champions. the same holds true today when they do the rankings for raw ic and smackdown u.s..pwi is considered the main source for what is considered a world title and their word is law here on wikipedia.they also have always maintained that the ic and u.s. championships are of equal value and of equal standing.as i have said before i am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to wikipedia only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact based on logic and references.jbl pwi and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. look at the triple crown champion discussion page.all i ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as i respectfully feel that i am in the right on this one.thank you for your time.vlh.,0

19741, yes what a great game from what i kept up with from live commentary from eurosport i could tell it was a great game. unfortunately my university studies will get in the way of all the champions league games at least for the group stage as over here in toronto they start at pm where my classes are scheduled. you have it lucky in itsly where you can watch it after work very upset about it but what are you gonna do. i could watch a re run of the game but i cant quite ever get into it because i already know what happens its not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone. i like shouting at the tv screen you probably know the feeling hahaha. highlights are he best bet but i know it doesnt show the full story of the game. so i cant banter much but what a game it would have been im sure. i talked to my brother about it though who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasnt for buffon it would be a whole different story. i love to see buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top goalkeeper at least this just goes to show that you cant doubt a teams champions league performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league. as a true fan you are always rough on your team but always stay by them through thick and thin. as youve said this should be a great confidence boost for juve and can hopefully channel it towards serie a and further cl games as there is still a long way to go hopefully juve can win the title for a th straight and prove to all the people that its roma or inters time for the scudetto in their place haha regards,0

19767,speedy deletion of elisabeth rodriguez a tag has been placed on elisabeth rodriguez requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a person or group of people but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for biographies. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0
19768,of course there is no intellectual property here outside the gfdl license. if you are unaccustomed to the term ‘intellectual property’ or afraid of it per se if it strikes terror in your heart or sounds to your ears like an imprecation within wikipedia context or is too highflying for wikipedia i cannot help you but please do not impute to me views which i have never articulated and do not hold. for you are not scoring the rhetorical points at which you aim but rather reduce the level of discourse to the point which i thought was beneath you — by involving yourself in a tangle of your own making.the case is very simple. ‘violation’ and ‘malfeasance’ involve here the claim of the infringement of wikipedia guidelines by two administrators who as such i.e. as administrators are charged instead with the safeguarding of those very guidelines. administrators yourself included do not and cannot play any role whatever within the wikipedia scheme other than that of assuring that wp guidelines are implemented and not infringed by the users there is no scope within the project as it stands defined at present for any other additional role that they might even potentially or hypothetically assume. even their efforts at protecting the site from vandalism etc. are only within their purview as guardians of published house rules which in this case define vandalism for example in ways differing from those understood by the general public — nothing nothing not an iota more than that. there is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’ ‘broad’ or otherwise whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability the moment that such powers to dispense with guidelines altogether are vested in or arrogated by them they cease to be administrators and become maandpa corner grocery’s owners with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit and wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few. so no i do not believe you understand that you do not operate here in a vacuum of your own making i am wikipedia every bit as much as you are thank you very much.you allege that i ‘have misunderstood the essentials of the system’ without specifying wherein that misunderstanding might have consisted in. you do not have the right to make such unsubstantiated allegations in this forum those are hits below the belt. you may say to me ‘you have claimed xxx which conflicts with stated policy xxx and fails to take into consideration the fact that xxx published here xxx’. the right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks a practice that again runs afoul of wikipedia policies. you are now violating those policies yourself. i am not concerned with your tone whether ‘polite’ or ‘vehement’ and how that impacts my liking or disliking you but with the substance of what you are saying and how that impacts the project we are both involved in.i wish to state that your own demeanour here has always struck me as approximating something of a big brother from orwell a position in part claimed by a kind of doublespeak. no one not even the founder holds here a monopoly on truth you might have called it ‘a system of permissions to hold opinions’ all views must be closely argued and fully substantiated by everyone without exception.administrators found guilty of deliberately with malice or otherwise aforethought violating house rules and subsequently showing remorseless unreasonable unreasoning defiance to the challenges of such violations on the strength that ‘i am an administrator and therefore i do not have to account for my actions to you’ must be removed as a matter of principle and will be removed. there is no other remedy as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions. enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here a certain integrity a sense of ethics and a modicum of objectivity the ability that is to see beyond the tip of one’s nose are also required. while the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity. you wish to protect the administrators accused of wrongdoing now by failing to answer the facts of the case as requested but drawing instead all kinds of red herrings out of the hat from the desire to m,0
19769,at the moment there is a four day hiatus while the ga reviewer is busy at work.the images had become an issue i originally just hid them with a drop down before realising that no matter which way i tried the alt= and alt text were not working in fact alt= was visible. the ga reviewer thinks they would be better spread out over the page but i am not so sure. i was trying to keep it more balanced between shipwreck and treasure as they are equally important but without the jewel pics as they have not emailed me back yet perhaps it might be better to spread them around. with the ga review due i thought i had better try and sort them out i tried so many different ways sizes and types of display drop downs wikitables and boxing that i just gave up after three hours i couldnt even see my monitor properly and had to go to bed. surprise surprise the very next day the review started lol i thought oh crap the images but when i went to look you had already sorted them out ¬as the ga reviewer states it is not part of the ga review though. ,0

19783,parishan the claim indeed is true and you are actually not saying the truth the evidence above gives examples of dozens of articles not one. and your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. the azeri term is the turkic term jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. all persian urdu and hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. there is no proper azeri distinct term for the place it is the official islamic term and the variants are either turkish or persian. we can write jerusalem in zulu language too it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. the evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where armenian terms were present and added azeri terms when it was not relevant. it was explained to you that the armenian term for jerusalem was present because there is an armenian quarter in old jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. as for the notability if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns you will actually remember one example in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else. you’ve been contributing here for a very significant period of time and should have by now known what qualifies as notable. according to your standards any college teacher would qualify. we have enough problems here to have to go through your articles’ creation and bring the notability issue.also parishan don’t you think that your consistent justifications questioning that it was retaliation are a little bit old? are you trying to insult our intelligence? you’ve retaliated on various circumstances on various cases and this was brought to you on many occasions. do you feel the need to have your memory refreshed? you deleted andranikpasha and expended the other article much like you have added the entry of armenia in the antisemitism article in the past as retaliation or worked on a nazi person as retaliation to vartan’s point which you misinterpreted. or when you retaliated to one article where an armenian term was added by adding azeri term in a dozen articles. this was all i had to say about the issue and if you won’t come clean and admit any wrongdoings then you are in no position to talk about any other contributor’s misbehaving. ,0

19805, stub sorting guidelines i sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting and really provide a guideline. i believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by april in a set of rules that we can follow. once we have built a set of guidelines we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines. we need to define what a specialized topic stub is how many articles it should cover when is it appropriate to create it what defines its need for its creation what defines its need for deletion what criteria it should follow what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub whether or not to start using subst for all templates whether or not use subst for all templates created by the metatemplates and any other matters that may come up in consideration. i thank for initially creating the subpage for the project at wikipediatalkwikiproject stub sorting/guidelines. even though they have been discussed i feel that we really need to confirm everything. for that we should discuss each issue with its own sections and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on. the english wikipedia is nearly at k articles. either the mediawiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories or the sorting is done manually by wikipedians. personally i think the latter is less taxing on the server load especially when we use subst which i think would help the wikipedia out performance wise. please make your comments at wikipediatalkwikiproject stub sorting/guidelines. i apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice but since the project has more members the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand. talk feb utcthat thing you did‘’hi gadfium a while back i was having trouble with some geography stubs and via the village pump you found out for me that theyd been created twice and fixed them. what did you do?’’just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. if that doesnt seem to work try refreshing the category that theyre in edit the category page and then change the url to say refresh instead of edit and as a last resort make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database. feb utc changing geostub this is bordering on the absurd. i have ended a number of my articles and stubs with oceaniageostub and someone has changed them to just plain stubs so now i make it just a stub and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geostub and then to an oceaniageostub. feb utcnuthin to do with me and anyone involved in the stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceaniageostub. which articles do you mean? hello? i dont even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of french polynesia and the cook islands. i havent bothered to look at whos changing the stubs or if perhaps its a problem with the db ive had on occasion to submit several times... feb utcthe db may be the culprit. these stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. as to an overhaul of the names that would mean changing + different regional stubs which between them are used on close to articles. its simply not practical. hello? ah. i will look into it. tokelau has always been something of a sidebar interest for me since they seem to be the leftout islands. ill check out what youve written and add anything that i think i might have to contribute. unfortunately for my ability to contribute to these polynesiarelated articles wikipedia is catching me about years after my interest in the subject reached its zenith... i ardently believe in the philosophy that drives wikipedia and so im doing whatever i can to write edit or create appropriate articles based mostly on memory which is why they seem sometimes perhaps to be a bit light on citation......if i had a crappier memory id be more hesitant about contributing... believe me tho...when i decided to move to the marquesas specifically to eïao my decision was wellresearched. of course this is the unrealized pipedream of an adolescent misfit...but my extensive research int,0

19818, you have not answered my question what did franklin mean by patriot in ? did he mean a supporter of the good old cause or did he mean something else? instead you write i think the misunderstanding is that pbs assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations. whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the good old cause or something else its usage today implies someone who supports their nation and if it is to be used before the udi then what does it mean as the nation did not exist? your argument the british colonists had made north america their country is i think flawed unless you think that virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the s and the s. surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots unless one is using the terms inconsistently. if they were rebels in the then why not use the term for the s as well? luckily one can usually substitute the word confederate for rebel so this is not usually a pov issue for civil war articles but using the word patriot in an article has pov connotations. for example in the main body of the text the first use of the term patriot is in the sentence the landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and when the royal governor of massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in boston patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests. in what way were the mobs patriotic? even the phrase rebellious mobs would not be accurate. antitax mobs would be more accurate but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs. ,0

19846,i believe people do not change and that a persons perspective is an innate and unchanging element of the soul which is created and raised by the material circumstances of a persons existence. an artificial soul in the words of dickens mr bumble. there is no convincing anyone of anything. it is simply impossible. either people understand or they do not. thats the way the world has always worked. regardless there is no obligation to be friendly this is not a social media. certain people are worth ignoring and the fellow that started this inquisition is one of those people. i am perfectly within my power to remove his comments from my page. i do not believe that he was acting in good faith. i simply do not. he wasnt quite clearly. he was attempting to remove an obstacle and he succeeded. it is all a matter of strategy. we must assume good faith but that doesnt mean we must be ignorant of bad faith. i find it hard to believe you can block me for harassment when ive never engaged with this editor at all. i refused to do so. if anything his behaviour was harassment. he made trumpedup charges on my talk page continually posted here despite my wishes to the contrary and then ran to an/i with no basis whatsoever. there are no grounds for a block of any kind and that is simple. you must unblock me at once. — ☎ ,0

19937,thanks. im not really that into the crises. bishonen and i approach wikipedia very differently and we can never understand why the other one doesnt get involved in crisis x or y that is so clearly allimportant. i care about policy. i figure that the principle of the thing is extremely important and if we get good policies and stick to them until it hurts and then change them when enough people feel the pain but only with consideration of the pains we feel and the ones we want to avoid all will be well. i think bishonen cares about people and particularly people getting stomped on by the bullies of the site. she helps people. anyway it kind of explains why ill just drop anchor on some prinicple or another and stay there no matter what like listening to what afd says and not unilaterally undeleting like rejecting the notion that there are expert editors. i also dont do much vandal blocking or reverting. i do have a plan for the articles im writing. one day i promise im going to finish the dunciad. well in the dunciad pope blasts a hole in about three dozen contemporaries. ive read the poem many many times studied it many times and ive always been a bit bugged that i never had a handle on who the dunces were what they had done to deserve their treatment or what they stood for. since i want to be more of an expert on the culture and politics of im on a groove to get a bio of every one of the dunces in and i was shocked to find that my employers library has a dnb. then its just a question of time and taking notes and writing.since reading dnb biographies means not grading papers its fairly irresistible. ,0

19947,hi. the issue here is very simple. the article currently states there is no evidence that ect causes brain damage in humans or animals. the article also states that there are no recent reviews that found such evidence. both of these claims in the article have been proven to be grossly incorrect. yet a paragraph is devoted to it. because such fallacious claims are made often however a paragraph was written pointing out an example of a mouse study pointing to the contrary and also cited a new study that found that ect compromises normal cerbral blood flow in humans possible evidence pointing to brain dysfunction. the information is sound supported and appropriate given the subheading and the preceding paragraph that promotes gross misstatements of fact by saying that there is no evidence of brain damage in humans or animals and no modern reviews pointing to such evidence. and yes there are reviews as has been proven. the progression of arguments to the contrary here is quite odd and revealing first the paragraph was too long and was trimmed down and a study removed. then theres an argument that the two studies dont directly relate to one another and shouldnt therefore be in the same paragraph even though its abundantly obvious why they are to contradict previous paragraph finding no evidence in humans or animals and provide an example of study finding brain damage in mice and an example study finding compromised abnormal cerebral blood flow in humans then an argument that this mouse study should only be a minor footnote that no one will read even though the reason its there is to provide an example that yes there is evidence then an attack is made on the design of the study apparently suggesting that it isnt evidence because of the mouse strain chosen. which i disagree with and regardless its not a wiki editors place to challenge the mouse strain choice of expert neuroscientists who make this stuff their lifes work its their study. moreover it isnt the superiority of the study that got it here it was listed as an example that yes there is evidence in animal models of brain damage. then the claim is made that the mouse study struggles to support the paragraph. then the mouse study is called trivial until its replicated even though again it was added as an example that yes there is evidence not because of overriding importance then i pointed out in the talk page that one of the no evidence claims made in the preceding paragraph in the article is that there are no modern reviews finding evidence of brain damage. i proved this claim to be false and cited to peter breggin a very wellknown md who has written a book on the topic and a recent comprehensive review of the literature citing close to references and finding numerous evidence of brain damage in animals. then breggin is personally attacked apparently suggesting that his published review isnt good enough to disprove the no evidence in recent reviews claim because hes not a reliable source. i also point out that there are other reviews finding evidence including one done in the russian mouse study. then in response to me writing that there there either is evidence of brain damage in animals or humans or there is not and that a single study stating that brain damage was found in a modern study can defeat the harsh claim of no evidence of brain damage in animals its argued that thats not the way that science works and several studies also can mean squat. then its argued i cant negate secondary sources that found no evidence of brain damage in animals or humans with direct primary sources of published experimental studies which found such damage as part of their experiment. this is not to mention that there are also other published reviews finding evidence of brain damage in others work. etc.in addition to this its claimed that this single paragraph briefly showing a couple studies pointing to possible adverse effects the subheading is adverse effects btw violates the wikipedia policy of undue weight. this is incredibly strange as the paragraph immediately before the new paragraph is entirely devoted to multiple claims of no evidence of braind damge in humans or animals. if a paragraph can be devoted to no evidence stating untruths then one can and should be added afterwards to give a couple of examples of this evidence which is claimed not to exist. of course the real problem here is the paragraph boldly asserting no evidence with regard to studies in humans or animals of brain damage. this has been proven to be false. the paragraph also asserts that no mo,0

19955, replaceable fair use image lindsay sequence freethrow thanks for uploading image lindsay sequence freethrow i noticed the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. if you believe this image is not replaceable please go to the image description page and edit it to add without deleting the original replaceable fair use template. on the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself.if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on this link. note that fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted days after this notification per our fair use policy. if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page. thank you. zzuuzz talk ,0

19965, origin of name paragraph i found this paragraph confusing. why was the sentence offering a translation changed to tell us that the name literally means exactly the same word that was just used? one would be better off removing the reference to the names meaning entirely. as is this is a redundant piece of information. are akuaino supposed to be equated to ghosts and goblins here or are they haunting the island at the same time as the ghosts and goblins?suggested rephrasing assumptions previously offered english rendering was accurate akuaino haunted the island in additionthe name lānaʻi is of uncertain origin but the island has historically been called lānaʻi o kauluāʻau which can be rendered in english as day of the conquest of kauluāʻau. this epithet refers to the legend of a mauian prince who was banished to lānaʻi for some of his wild pranks at his fathers court in lāhainā. the island was haunted by akuaino ghosts and goblins. kauluāʻau chased them away and brought about peace and order on the island and was in consequence restored to the favor of his father.,0
19966,a side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial into something specialthis does not mean that what risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. of course there may be interesting things there. same with other methods etc. but this whole topic guitar pedagogy seems to be one where i can get information from anyone even my neighbor. in other words the body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is to a great extent not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. hence i detest when risteski writes this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musicalaesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music. what he wishes to display as something new is rather something that i could easily learn and find while having discussions with my friends with a glass of wine. so cheers to guitar philosophy at the same time i can look at the article and see it empty. risteskis articles can at least provide some food for thought and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. i suggest lets mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. add sugar to taste writing articles for wikipedia is different than writing a term paper for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. in all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. taking that approach to wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. for wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic giving appropriate propotion to each. and again tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is not an improvement to the article. the red pen of doom ,0
19967,hellohi harebag welcome when i saw the article on the pigeon force police department i thought it was a joke. it is real. i also started a new article on larry buendorf. hes a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground. any suggestions for improvement let me know. as for your article i suggest a little background. mention the city and state name. fix the link. good luck on editing additional suggestions for pigeon force pd whos the chief? any major history? big crime solved? any controversy or major lawsuit against it? when was it established? was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established if so when?. these are just tips. otherwise there is a risk that someone will petition for the articles deletion because there is a board for that thus destroying your hard work. thats the reason that i wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly. i do plan to add more to my article though. archives. please sign your messages so people know who is writing them and can write back to you. you do this by clicking on the squiggly lines about inches below the box where you type. . there are people who search for things to delete. dont ask me why. . to add references type in the reference after your sentence. for example type boston is the capital of massachusetts. then after the period type a < then ref then > then and so then < then / then ref then >. i cant do it here otherwise the computer will make my example into a footnote and you then wouldnt be able to see it. the at the bottom type { then { then reflist then } then } so that the references will print up as a list. another way is just to pull up an article push the edit this page and see how the computer source is written and copy it for your article. i dont know the answers to your questions. just wait and see. i wouldnt do articles at once until you get a feel of whats accepted and whats not. im the wrong person to ask. dont worry people will come around. they did to my article within a day or two. ,0
