1907,modi is using his abilities to benefit humanity. thats why he is competing with paigamber and jesus.,1
1908,congress has feeling of wining by getting all antihindu and antiindian votes. you may be pak who support congress to break india? ,1

1915,modi is like a last airbender putting all out efforts to save humanity in india from the clutches of biggest group of thieves in modern indian politics. ,1

1917,sorry down voted. rahu ghandy party will get seats in single digit only. ,1
1918,yes people should vote modi on basis of his work done and not on religious interests. ,1
1919,even muslim ladies voted for modi in up. so yes entire india is being converted to bhakts because of his sincerity towards humanity. ,1
1920,kejriwal is best and modi comes after him. modi is so much scared of kejriwal that he put entire govt machinary after him but then also nothing happened. bring strong lokpal if there is inch seena or start wearing what womens wwea ,1

1922,modi has only one credibility. he supported hindus during gujarat riots.,1
1923,modi is just a drama artist who never dared to touch real issues like uniform civil code and article . even he could not dare to come out of the unfair water sharing treaties with enemy country.,1
1924,modi can be considered as the patch work artist who enjoyed free foreign trips in tax money . but he has postponed real problems to next generation leaders.,1

1938,ay higher price for demonetization gst increased taxes increased prices for petroleum products lesser interest dividends from small savings pensions and provident funds lesser budgetary provisions for agriculture health and education,1
1939, years of unruly and corrupted governance mostly under khangress and then vibrant policy change under modi as well as quick and bold implementation of some of the new policies definitely drew the attention of indians but in international arena as well. i will pray before thy god for this man to rule for next years and that will completely undo the omen effect of pathetic khangress ,1
1940,progress is the mantra and real talent is getting valued. people need to buck up and stand up beyond caste religion and other nonsense. just think of the wonderful moment where our pm spoke about latest trends in technology. ,1
1941,bhakts get enthralled and have goosebumps when their masters speak. no wonder ,1
1942,% constitute muslim and christian pigs. rest % constitute hindus who are stupid equivalent to rahul or those who lost beloved black money in demonitization or those who have to pay tax now to do business after gst. rest % cow loving people are with modi. ,1
1943,congress leaders must be wondering what is there in modi that endears him to the people of india year after year. ,1

1949,gas electricity economic houses toilets roads safe railway journey all shared by people irrespective of relegion. ban on triple talaque a gift tô muslim sisters. and you say what modi did for muslims. of course he wont do appeasement politics for short term gains ,1
1950,bjp it cell in full force... ,1
1951,what have they done to hindus?? can you please tell?? that is what is expected from a govt. no religious bias that is what a true secular govt is expected to do. a benefit should reach out to all not for a single community or religion. ,1
1952,yogi is not only about religion he is an effective administrator a living example of simplicity an example of a common nan who believes in god a person who nor only cares about human but also cares about animals ..,1
1953,modi is a honest man.. proven through all litmus someone he supports we will support just like we standed for him during demonization. ,1
1954,kanjaariwal is secular he goes only where people raise slogans against the country he even has selective approach towards rape victims they have to be from the minority.... ,1

1960,itne sawal tak puchte rehta toh aaj yeh article aur yeh comment nahi aaya hota. itna negative. modi me bijli ke khambe saal mein laga. toilet majority gaon ke gharo mein ban rahe hai bank account khulwaye..etcetc ,1
1961,the people of india must stop the feudal rule of gandhi family who along with all the other corrupt criminals like lalu mulayam mayawati mamata kymaraswami yeachiri are up for destroying our motherland bratarbarsha india. ,1
1962,fake poll sponsored by bjp. where are the jobs created? chaiwala jobs? where are his cabinet members? what are they doing? sleeping and collecting paychecks? nice con job bjp. no development projects in the south only in gujjuland and up. ,1

2202,the people who are against modi are just the chrislamists and im sure i will get plenty of hate messages following this comment. boot these guys out modiji. secularism introduced by igandhi in can go to hell and stay there. ,1
2203,i have not participated in the survey but i want to add my vote in favour of modi ji ,1
2204,impossible to believe that modi will be back ,1
2205,hey husain bhai just come out from your religious hatred to modi. think about better india better future for your kids. you know very well rahul can not give better future. rahul is good for nothing. you remember rahul and congress has not done anything for muslim community. ,1
2206,will never ever bjp again.... ,1
2207,only modi ji can clean the indian politics and take india ahead... ,1
2208,another paid and biased poll to create a modi win ,1
2209,if this paid media report is to be believed bjp must get /th majority ie more than seats for the lok sabha. dream pill for the bhakts ,1
2210,the nation badly needs a task master and found him in modi . ,1
2211,development is in speed in modi time when compared to other prime minister. if this speed continues india can come to a comparable position with china. the price is stable and low except petrol and diesel. a lot if money being spent on infrastructure and defence which was not done in other government. ,1
2212, % its fake news .its just to confuse people. we all fed up of petrol price n gst. ,1
2213,% fake survey ,1
2214,modijis support get unite and start campaign looter are trying hard to misguide innocent people . we will vote for modiji. ,1

2216,yes...modi has done so much.. increased unemployment... increased fuel prices.... increase in number of soldier deaths.....misconducted polling.......no growth for central govt employees..... stealing land of farmers for fake projects.....he sees only growth of adani n ambani.....common people remained common in his tenure.... wealthy became more wealthy.... increase in women n child crimes....no action against criminals.... induction of criminals by giving tickets during election..... ,1
2217,i request every india lover modi lover to please dont forget to cast your vote in and encourage at least people around you in your locality to vote for help modi ji become stronger to serve the nation for long period ,1
2218,vote for modi to save country from pappu ,1
2219,if modi doesnt get majority seats in lok sabha elections opposition will by hook or crook make a third front govt. that will dismantle all the efforts that modi has sincerely done in last years. ,1
2220,please go out and vote in numbers for your favourite choice. we all know including the world leaders that modi is the best pm india can ever have. comparison of modi with pappu is the biggest lame joke today show one speech or action of pappu that draws thunderous applause or appreciation ,1
2221,burnol for the mad modi haters ,1
2222,har har modi main sirf modi ,1

2235,do not believe in such polls most probably doctored by modi bhakts. bjp is allowing rss to become mainstream and that can not be good for india. usa has already put india on freedom of religion watchlist. rape and murder is modis political strategy. ,1
2236,we support narendra modi ,1
2237,in jumlebazi pm modi is very much concerned about health of the people but in reality he is charging % gst on fall in the category of essentiality and not luxury. ,1

3158,ignoring everything about congress party ,1
3159,congress did not even come close to doing all those things in the years that they have ruled india,1
3160, if the people of the country think right act right and vote right a party like congress will not win the ls elections.,1
3161,we as a national will have to make modiji win more than seats.,1
3162,after pulwama attack and its strong and befitted reply in the form of air strike given by indian government under narendra modi.,1
3163,as a matter of fact narendran modi in spite of so many issues against him and grand alliance has still been able to keep his popularity ratings quite higher,1
3164, modi is a respected and mass leader and indian still have very high regards for this man especially his commitment devotion and dedication toward india. ,1
3165,narendra modi is still in the hearts of millions of the people in india.,1
3166, bjp has been gaining ground throughout the country in recent past.,1
3167,a large portion of indian people especially educated youngsters are mad for narendra modi as their leader.,1
3168,for people bjp means narendra modi and narendra modi means bjp .,1
3169,narendra modi has been able to project himself as a hindu leader very successfully. narendra modi very often has played the hinduvta card successfully.,1
3170,it is a fact that narendra modi has invented a lethal combination of politics in india hindutva + development + nationalism ,1
3171,for opposition it is extremely difficult to stop bjp in general election in .,1
3172,the development done by narendra modi and bjp is also a reason for a strong possibility of bjp’s clear victory in coming election.,1
3173,the opposition neither has the unity nor the strategies to counter and face narendra modi or bjp,1
3174, the opposition or the grand alliance does not even have any other agenda apart from removing narendra modi by hook or by crook.,1
3175,india does not have an alternative to narendra modi. i think this is narendra modi’s biggest plus point.,1
3176,more and more people are getting bold towards hinduism and identifying themselves with bjp and narendra modi.,1
3177,after the pulwama attack the country wanted stringent actions from the modi government and he did exactly that,1
3178,this is the new india under narendra modi against terrorism. therefore today narendra modi has emerged as one of the most popular leaders across the country,1
3179, i am confident that bjp alone will cross + seats in general elections.,1
3180,bjp is a democratic party. if you have the guts courage smartness and confidence you can reach to any post.,1
3181,this is the time where indians have to choose between “two bads”. i will choose bjp and narendra modi.,1
3182,if narendra modi is a bad prime minister rahul gandhi will be the worst prime minister.,1
3183,show me a strong alternative of narendra modi and my vote goes to that person.,1
3184,neither modi nor any other leader on the planet can change country crore in years. he has done tremendous job.,1
3185,instead of hating modi we should take his help to make lives of our community better.,1
3186, i am very sure that we will listen narendra modi ji taking oath as the next prime minister of india,1
3187,rahul gandhi and the entire congress leadership lost face in rafale surgical strike balakot strike,1
3188,bjp seem to have gradually fastened it net all around. balakot gave an opportunity to show modi mantle.,1
3189,but next years are important days for strong india so i would be voting for bjp,1
3190,nda will end up getting more % votes and higher number of seats.,1
3191,bjp commands a formidable votebank comprising of upper castes and obcs.,1
3192,even if a few seats are won by opposing regional parties they will end up supporting bjp later.,1
3193, seats for bjp seem quite feasible.,1
3194,what modi has achieved apart from a few setbacks is something i believe is unprecedented.,1
3195,pm modi is the man i wish to see leading my country post as well. and that’s why i will be voting for him,1
3196,the modi government has struck one blow after another and hit indias economy,1
3197,the most glaring aspect of modinomics is that it has diminished india’s strong trade fundamentals and left its image battered due to its faulty policies,1
3198,modis mismanagement of the indian economy may be his downfall. ,1
3199, should be without bjp else we all will be responsible for a failed economy known as india.,1
3200,my prediction this time bjp and nda will win seats in loksabha elections,1
3201,i am repeating my prediction for election made in aug . “ bjp will get seats on there own in loksabha election.,1
3202,modi slams congress bjd over poverty,1
3203,economy has been destroyed in five years due to modis actions,1
3204,in all parts of maharashtra people want nda to return to power. they trust the work of the centre and maharashtra government.,1
3205,people r happy with the developments done by bjp govt .they have full faith in narendra modi ji. ,1
3206,rahul gandhi cannot be the pm of india in –.,1
3207,rahul by adopting wayanad is sending a message that he cannot contest in a challenging circumstances.,1
3208,rahul becoming pm is highly improbable.,1
3209,congress leaders are not cooperating with jds where their candidates are contesting and vice versa. there is a complete pademonium in the alliance now.,1
3210,bjp’s resilience is so high that the regional parties are in a fix. mahagathbandhan is falling apart and also failing.,1
3211,rahul will be trounced by smriti irani in amethy.,1
3212,aap will lose all the seats. it will not be represented in the lower house of the parliament.,1
3213,for the first time bjp a party other than congress wins a second term after completing the full term.,1
3214,modi wave is even more intense and powerful than . when people arrive to hear modi and other leaders of bjp one can non lyrics say bjp is the only option of the people.,1
3215, bjp is winning the election once again and modi bis forming the government in .,1
3216,congress cannot be expected to win the election on any count. but can be expected to give the best performance of crossing even .,1
3217,congress made a very great blunder by allowing rahul to contest a second constituency. it is an open secret that rahul is trailing behind smriti irani in amethy.,1
3218,congress has become very desperate. this desperation is seen in its manifesto,1
3219,congress is finding it difficult to find a good candidate to fight against bjp,1
3220,going through these it is evident congress is going to be defeated. the reasons can be found in their own sins committed and also the blunders of the party,1
3221,congress is losing out everywhere.,1
3222,bjp is confident of forming government in ,1
3223,there is no opposition to the leadership of modi from the opposition since they have never arrived at any one as their leader,1
3224,rahul gandhi knows that he can never win against bjp,1
3225,defeating bjp is next to impossible for him so long as modishah duo are at the helm of affairs in bjp,1
3226,rahul is not the most wanted leader in the opposition.,1
3227,rahul himself has reduced in his appeal and also acceptance compared to . ,1
3228, in fact no opposition leader can compete with modi. modi still rule the stage. ,1
3229,the clamor for modi and spontaneous crowd to hear him have made him a cult figure. entire election is revolving round him.,1
3230,poor leadership of the opposition unimpressive speeches etc. have confirmed that bjp is the only option and modi is the only alternative.,1
3231,bjp at the most may cross maximum on the higher side.,1
3232,it is absolutely necessary for the people know of all the ills committed by congress during their terms. ,1
3233,modi has been highlighting the faults of congress which is his right and also his duty,1
3234, election is because of modi wave it certainly can be sustainable. without a wave bjp cannot get a majority on its own,1
3235,it is highly impossible for rahul to lose from both the constituencies of amethy and wynad,1
3236,i believe that bjp will perform well and win the election because this is the only party which is fighting the election to win while all others are contesting for their survival.,1
3237,every leader of every opposition party is scared of modi and his prowess as a great administrater,1
3238,bjp is the only party which has the capacity to win the election. no other party other than congress is contesting more than seats.,1
3239,congress have no hope of victory,1
3240,in general election modi is the only leader for prime minister and he has no competitor.,1
3241,nothing is making me believe that the congress will perform well in general election.,1
3242,rahul is in a fools paradise that he will become the pm of india. ,1
3243,congress is not in a position to sweep any state or even win half the seats in the state.,1
3244, congress may find it difficult to reach the figure or even what it scored in . congress performing well do not arise at all.,1
3245,congress do not have alliance in vast majority of states where it is too weak to take on bjp which has grown into a monolithic party.,1
3246, congress victory in is out of sync with the reality and it bis impossible.,1
3247,in election rahul gandhi is made to doubt his victory in his ancestral constituency of amethy which has been returning nehrugandhi family representatives since last forty years.,1
3248,nda is confident of winning election because of the opposition forced to promise which can never be realised.,1
3249,opposition is having a dearth of leader who can match modi.,1
3250,the entire election is about modi. even the opposition attack have been centered round modi and no one else,1
3251,only if the importance of modi is incomparable can such an emphasis will be given to him.,1
3252,the opposition is fearing modi more and are afraid he may occupy the seat of power. hence they want dub his programs and policies.,1
3253,the opposition is totally scared if modi comes back to power their survival may become doubtful. all are upset. hence their tirade against modi. this is only increasing modi’s popularity.,1
3254, bjp will get seats. hence crossing in the three states of up wb and c’ghar has acquired importance.,1
3255,whatever rahul does modi comes out with a rejoinder which is even more powerful.,1
3256,modi’s strategies are too good for him and most of the time he doesnt have any answers for the same.,1
3257,modi factor has become too huge for the opposition to handle. the desperation frustration and confusion only making the cause of opposition difficult.,1
3258, modi wave is only gaining speed. people have been openly expressing their votes for modi even though he is not contesting in their constituencies. importance of modi is gaining in strength.,1
3259,every one feel modi has an upper hand as compared to other parties in general election ,1
3260,the unrest in the opposition confusion in their ranks and inability to read what is in store for them are clear indication that bjp and modi are in the ascendance.,1
3261,every poll survey to this day shows modi far ahead of his competitors. he has been maintaining his popularity above % throughout.,1
3262,all want to defeat rahul gandhi because he is the weakest leader who can be defeated even by a novice. he has neglected his constituency ,1
3263,people do not want to defeat modi because he is conducting himself well and also he is impeccably honest. people feel there is no replacement for him now.,1
3264,modi and bjp have convincingly demolished all that congress stood for secularism appeasement dynasty politics socialism etc. ,1
3265,again is centered round modi and modi wave.,1
3266,bjp did not have a strong winning combination in bihar in . but now the alliance is powerful with jdu and ljp.,1
3267,the interim budget of modi % reservation for ebc category the air strike on balakote release of abhinandan etc. add to modi’s strength.,1
3268,congress do not have any hope of forming a government on its own.,1
3269,it is not that congress should not win the general electionbut congress cannot win the election.,1
3270, nda is having a too formidable combination which can never be defeated in ,1
3271, rahul has not left any lasting impression on the voters.,1
3272,rahul has a dubious distinction of failing in his attempts.,1
3273,so far no impact of rahul on the election is visible and do not seem to happen over the next three or four weeks either.,1
3274,congress is not even able to form a coalition government. congress is aiming for survival of the party. this is the journey of congress from to .,1
3275,congress has a dubious record of creating false accounts or ghost accounts and siphon of the money.,1
3276,absolute majority for bjp may not be possible. but nda may get absolute majority.,1
3277,rahul should put an end to loose talk in the party which is spoiling the chances of the party.,1
3278,modi has the capacity to take it to dizzy heights too. rahul is losing out on modi.,1
3279,the opposition will not be able to thwart modi juggernaut in elections,1
3280,modi is consolidating people under nationalism which appeal to more across all cross section,1
3281,modi has acquired importance more than what he expected. naturally modi wave has become to powerful too. ,1
3282,bjp isnt the main opponent of congress and rahul in wayanad,1
3283,no one wants to vote for a party with no leader or a leader like rahul gandhi.,1
3284,when congress have congressmen they dont need bjp to defeat them to win elections,1
3285,the modi wave in maybe isnt as strong as but it surely exists enough strong to make modi pm again ,1
3286,narendra modi is the only prime ministerial candidate for general elections,1
3287, modi is popular decisive hardworking and honest. he is the only candidate and the best of all.,1
3288,congress is not considered as a party which can transfer votes in up. ,1
3289,congress and left failed to reach any agreement on wb and now rahul gandhi contesting from kerala has ended any possibility of alliances with left.,1
3290,congress has done well to get into alliances in maharashtra and tamil nadu.,1
3291,i think rahul gandhi is not a seasoned politician yet. he is still a work in progress as of now in and this is clear from prepoll political alliances.,1
3292,winning and loosing are part of politics but rahul must show to the world that he is there for long term.,1
3293,if rahul really works hate then he can become a contender for pm in .,1
3294,rahul gandhi may still has edge over smriti irani in amethi lok sabha seats but the fight is going to be close.,1
3295,congress is not so relevant in a few states and it cannot contribute much. ,1
3296,whether rahul will become the pm or not but he is definitely the meme material because of your speech,1
3297,rahul gandhi visited various places at bhandup and interacted with people there.,1
3298,it’s a bit rich for rahulgandhi to talk of introducing democracy in cities by direct election of mayors when he hasn’t been able to restore innerparty democracy in congress.,1
3299,rahulgandhi ji has raised the issue of restoration of water bodies and protecting the environment in the electoral discourse of the country,1
3300,journalists get injured in congress rallies.,1
3301, rahul gandhi announces huge sops for education sector if voted to power.,1
3302,so modi plays his dangerous divisive politics without any shame. his comments on rahul gandhi contesting from wayanad are a disgrace.,1
3303,rahulgandhi has become the most popular personality in this country,1
3304,fact rahulgandhi is disgusting right from childhood,1
3305,now republic have to work overtime to stop rahulgandhi from becoming pm ,1
3306,incredible day in wayanad kerala as congress president rahul gandhi ji files his nomination. thousands gathered to share their love. ,1
3307,kerala accepts rahul gandhi’s nomination from wayanad for loksabha elections ,1
3308,rahulgandhi must be ashamed on himself. only a shameless person can stand in front of public who has totally rejected him,1
3309,if this time india does not understand the value of mr. narendra modi then it never can.,1
3310,just think our modi ji is getting that much respect among foreigners for taking the correct steps in india.,1
3311,modi will come in power again and india will be purified fully.,1
3312,i feel that namo tv or similar other channels of other parties should not be considered as violation of code of conduct. they should not be banned. rather encourage them.,1
3313,show me a day when rahul gandhi has kept india first above anything else. ,1
3314,show me when was rahul gandhi serious about anything.,1
3315,show me a day when rahul gandhi showed any respect for the constitution or this country.,1
3316,hope you have realized by now why no one wants to vote for rahul gandhi.,1
3317,if rahul gandhi becomes pm i will commit suicide.,1
3318,that would be the worst day for the nation if raga comes in power. he is like suicide bomb for the nation.,1
3319,our pm celebrated diwali with our soldiers for five consecutive years,1
3320,modi wooed people across the world with his speeches made at their respective parliaments and became the st indian pm to do so.,1
3321,the digital pioneers across the world praising pm modi for his work for giving a boost to the digital revolution with his digital india project.,1
3322,even china couldn’t resist welcoming modi,1
3323,modi always made us proud back here in india while being outside but is being criticized out of jealousy because,1
3324,hardly any other indian pm achieved such milestones ,1
3325,pm modi made a record of working maximum number of hours at prime minister’s office pmo despite so many foreign visits.,1
3326,a hard working year old selfraised indian who has not only surprised people across the world through his lifestyle and achievements but has always inspired us withlove for our nation,1
3327,modi ji becomes prime minister again no one can stop him from building a strong india.,1
3328,people will believe in modi ji and all other parties will start to loose its charm and the people will elect the same govt again and again.,1
3329,from his muscular approach to pakistan to a weak opposition narrative there are undeniable pushes aiding narendra modi back to power.,1
3330,it was the youth and they wanted to change the future. this was capitalized by narendra modi as a nationalist movement. the last election was not about the party but the leader.,1
3331,narendra modi and bharatiya janata party bjp are seeking re election after a landslide victory in .,1
3332,the bjp is trying to convince the hindu majority to vote along sectarian lines in the upcoming parliamentary elections.,1
3333,after pulwama bjp has got an advantage. i believe narendra modi are the clear front runner or winner as of now.,1
3334,if modernday elections are about money machine and media team narendra modi has a huge advantage.,1
3335,narendra modi remains indias neta number one,1
3336,in election campaign an energetic narendra modi has demonstrated indefatigable energy sharp communication skills and the ability to punch above his partys weight,1
3337,the modi hai to mumkin hai is a tag line that has made the bjp and the government indistinguishable from the charismatic individual at the top.,1
3338, with a committed sangh parivar cadre base and a wellentrenched booth worker setup the bjp organisation has a last mile connectivity advantage with its potential voters.,1
3339,in the three months since its victories in the assembly elections in three important hindi heartland states the congress has been unable to build on the momentum.,1
3340,rahul gandhi remains an enigma wrapped in a mystery.,1
3341,narendra modi will emerge as a winner in lok sabha election .,1
3342,it also seems that “ namo again” is a true wave in election.,1
3343,pm modi does not need to do same theatrics which rg does one day calling him thief and other day forcibly embracing him in parliament.,1
3344,if modi wanted he could easily neglected his comment. but he took it as a weapon,1
3345,bjp is benefited by rahul’s growth. now when you say election first thing comes in your mind is rahul and modi and you choose modi without questioning,1
3346,with among many other childish comment which we have got habitual i don’t think rahul gandhi deserves to be a pm. certainly not now.,1
3347,rahul needs experience. he needs good people behind his back like modi has. ,1
3348,if muslims are really interested in the welfare of their community they should vote for bjp,1
3349,congress has been ruling for the last years but muslims are still not completely educated.,1
3350,the right royal way for muslims is to join the bjp and become part of hindu psyche. this will definitely allow them to live with hindus and their children get educated ,1
3351,if muslims join bjp and support narendra modi you will have the same status as what gujarat muslims have,1
3352,the best thing you can do is to defeat rahul gandhiji in wayanad.,1
3353,muslims have been taken for granted by the congress,1
3354,modi does not own bjplike the gandhi family owning congress so will remain a party worker. as an expm he may be authorised a house and live in it.,1
3355,rahul is not only ignorant but dangerously so for the tremendously potent country called india.,1
3356,since the day bjp has taken up the central government in hand they have done a few good things and a few bad ones as well.,1
3357,during the congress rule i have seen shameless politicians and businesspersons coming out with one scam after another every months,1
3358, i heard about the bofors scam when congress played havoc with the national security.,1
3359,narendra modi our honorable prime minister has been the target of criticism since the day he joined office. ,1
3360, the bjp and modi ji are busy building their country through the massive ground work.,1
3361,modi ji has the nerves of steel to deal with corrupt opposition like congress mentally sick indian folks and his rivals who want to kill him to get rid of him,1
3362,i strongly favor modi ji for being a stern man with quick wits much necessary to rule india.,1
3363,women empowerment is now actually taking place under bjp rule.,1
3364,even though i don’t think demonetization was successful according to its claimed agenda people still stood by modi ji.,1
3365, demonetization was a well planned success for the bjp because at that up election was to come by.,1
3366,thanks to demonetization that the bjp won else congress would have used the black money power to garner votes. ,1
3367,the greatest achievement of our prime minister according to my opinion is that he has instilled a great sense of love for the nation among indians.,1
3368,people realize now that they live in a much better off country than many other nations and that a government like bjp needs our support as well to function well. ,1
3369,this year election will be tough for bjp as congress seem to have regain its momentum.,1
3370,the bjp which swept the lok sabha polls by winning of the seats may find the going tough in the elections after the alliance between two arch rivals the sp and the bsp.,1
3371,god forbid bjp comes to power they will ruin our country completely already they have made the country into a pathetic state.,1
3372,in last years bjp have transformed everything from a peaceful free nation where citizens were used to live in harmony love and mutual respect into a state where “fear” is predominant.,1
3373,it will be disastrous for the country to have narendra modi as prime minister,1
3374,bjp has given absolutely nothing to us instead of supporting us in our growth they have not only snatched away our savings but also wasted the public money ,1
3375,there is no modi wave of any magnitude. whatever we are watching hearing and reading about the election is on social electronic and print media. ,1
3376,mission of modi in seemed very much possible but today same mission is not looking positive,1
3377,the positive side of bjps political compaign as observed in last five years is that till the day prior to casting of the votes they succeed in projecting that they are way ahead of their rivals,1
3378,indian army only became powerful after modi came to power,1
3379,pm modi his leaders and his fans have converted patriotism to mindless jingoism.,1

3788,the son of the poor man is the pm because of his work ,1
3789,nostradamus or no nostradamus. narendramodi is coming back with bigger majority. modifor,1
3790, rahulgandhi who said you are going to come back? some astrologers. dont believe them. it is modi again,1
3791,modi govt deserves all the credit for the surgical strikes.,1
3792,no matter dumils show hates barks towards u till they die but we tamils always support u sir modifor,1
3793,then for what r u waiting for go and start a new business dude....rajniti mein kuch nahi rakha hai..modifor sambhal lenge,1
3794,bollybarbie tollybarbie kollybarbie n we dont care for barbies. we care for india n modifor for sure.,1
3795,last months. wonder wth upa/congress was doing all these years. this is the reason we need narendramodi govt again again.,1
3796, general election belongs to bjp and narendra modi it is as simple as that,1
3797,i come from a family which is a conservative and loyal to anticongress.,1
3798,modi who can change the view of a traditional congressi voter family within a few years imagine how many families will be there in the country who has the direct benefit of these schemes?,1
3799,there is no doubt there is still a modi wave however the oppostion is now united in most of the states .,1
3800,bjp have to play it safely and be humble and accept that lot of work is still pending but lot also have been achieved .,1
3801,some of the parties from others will then provide outside support to nda in return for any important cabinet positions .,1
3802,bjp has always been in the forefront of demanding protection of independence integrity fairness and robustness of all our democratic institutions including the media,1
3803,electoral reforms with special focus on transparency in political and electoral funding which is so essential for a corruptionfree polity has been another priority for bjp,1
3804, i don’t think rahul gandhi should be considered worthy of any spot in politics let alone the prime minister’s seat.,1
3805,no one from the congress is fit for the pm post of india let alone raga.,1
3806,if bjp wins seats due to modi. i will be extremely happy. go out and celebrate it by having a great dinner with other friends who are fans of modi.,1
3807,another term of modi govt with congress not anywhere close to power is what i want.,1
3808,i am extremely doubtful if modi is going to win again or not. i will be pleasantly surprised if i am proven wrong though.,1
3809, modi “saved” a drowning country and people and lot of people recognized this inside.,1
3810,modi might not have done extremely well or there may be gaps but when people weigh him against opposition they will be loathe to take a risk of throwing him out and bringing in instability.,1
3811,i must hasten to add that is decisive prime minister and does not hesitate to take risky decisions if warranted .,1
3812,modi did exhibit courage on various issues and lived upto the expectations of the citizens of india and did not faulter when the occasion demanded.,1
3813,narendra modi is one man empire that has more chances to triumph than the diverse army of rival kings.,1
3814,i made up my mind for bhartiya janata party bjp.,1
3815,not a single bomb blast or major tragedy occured under narendra modi’s tenure till date,1
3816,make in india initiative saw a tremendous rise in employment in technical sectors can be improved more if bjp is given a chance for another years.,1
3817,corruption decreased gradually though not completely but at least a bit amongst politicians due to modi,1
3818,metro projects undertaken in several cities mumbai kochi bangalore jaipur nagpur etc and constructions are in full swing despite some hurdles under modi,1
3819,bjp are merciless against terrorism whereas the former government wasn’t or supported it.,1
3820,good relations with israel russia and us. india under bjp has saw a tremendous growth for negotiations with israel for it biotechnology and agriculture,1
3821,though bjp favoured the reliance chairman mukesh ambani to some extent the rewards are being sweet fruits. ,1
3822,bjp should be reelected and given one more chance given they have performed reasonably well under shri narendra modi.,1
3823,the bjp for sometime especially in the wake of the strong modi wave looked set to pose a serious challenge to the trinamool congress tmc.,1
3824,the mamata government was clearly getting unnerved by the bjps rise.,1
3825,if rahul gandhi can speak by his own in any public meeting without any meme on the next day ill sure think that he can be better pm than modi.,1
3826,kejriwal’s party has filed a complaint before the election commission against prime minister modi alleging that he has violated the model code of conduct,1
3827,but in my opinion like anyone who knows even a little bit of politics nda will form the government.,1
3828,i believe that the modi wave might have declined a little bit. but the mandate may approve him for being pm again.,1
3829,modi is promoting nationalism and unification in indian youth,1
3830,rahul gandhi promises rs a year to five crore poorest families. poor people will be attracted.,1
3831,lets give modi ji a chance again . he deserves it. we deserve him.,1
3832,my vote goes for bjp and narendra modi in ,1
3833,currently congress is led by rahul gandhi and he is not at all rhetoric. ,1
3834,in politics some qualities are necessary to be a leader but rahul gandhi failed to prove to be a good leader.,1
3835,the most drawbacks of congress government are corruption failed to make india a manufacturing hub even we have the manpower and skills,1
3836,some of the drawbacks of bjp government are rupee reaches its highest not implemented lok pal bill the uniform civil code is not implemented,1
3837,we know that modi and amit shah’s pair never lose an election in gujarat and most probably bjp will gear up his game in the coming days.,1
3838,considering both parties my vote goes to bjp for as i personally feel that we should give them more years. rest is choice up to you guys.,1
3839,mamata is tense to the point that her production of goons can no more match the quality and persistence of bjp.,1
3840,to save the fabric of the country we must bring down narendra modi,1
3841,narendra modi has already won elections,1
3842,it’s very difficult for the opposition to make an impact. there is a modi wave and you can’t ignore it.,1
3843,it is bjps clever ‘rajneeti’ which helped them to become the largest political party in the world today.,1
3844,the charm of narendra modi as well as of bjp is still intact among the people.,1
3845,bjp did not achieve anything remarkable but they did try every single time to improve something.,1
3846,in the years of modi ive seen change. ive seen india take stand against pakistan ive witnessed a steady rise in indias soft power,1
3847, unlike congress theres been no scam in modis rule yet,1
3848,if you think bjp has not achieved anything then you should also note that it hasnt failed us.,1
3849,there were negative outcomes when congress ruled us. in bjp even if you think theres nothing good you have to accept the fact that nothing bad has happened too.,1
3850,i wont white wash modi and yesi dont like the rise of hindutva politics but to me the benefits of bjp far outweigh its disadvantages.,1
3851,its either modi alone or rahul gandhi along with regional parties with no experience at the top and believe me you dont want the latter to be heading your country for years.,1
3852,vote for bjp if you want india to grow or vote for the new coalition government headed by congress if you want to see india fail.,1
3853,iran is true friend of india and very important to us that’s why we cannot disregard the iran for just sake of usa so again great leadership shown by pm narendra modi,1
3854,all thieves have comes together to beat one man pm narendra modi ji,1
3855,rahul gandhi has not experience of administration but the rahul gandhi has a genious mind which other don’t have like only he know allo ki factory ,1
3856,so again and again my vote will go to pm narendra modi ji in lok sabha coming election and i want to make an appeal here please do not waste yours precious vote,1
3857,congress itself is hellbent on destroying itself.,1
3858,bjp can win seats in election especially after pulwama attack and its strong and befitted reply in the form of air strike given by indian government under narendra modi.,1
3859,congress promises redressal of farmer distress easing of unemployment thrust on education and health care.,1
3860,i am extremely satisfied with the congress manifesto because they have declared what we are expecting from congress and what we are listening from them since many years,1
3861,what can we expect from congress abating the national security blunders and same old fake promises so yes we have received the same in this manifesto there is nothing to dissatisfy.,1
3862,it seems that the markets have already factored in the reelection of prime minister modi,1
3863,a second term for prime minister modi though may be relatively beneficial for indian businesses which suffered from the opening of the indian retail sector to foreign competition.,1
3864, modi’s foreign policy failed to overcome the impasse presented by trump,1
3865,rahul gandhi lost the tempo of the loksabha election. he started using abusive languages against pm modiji.,1
3866,rahul gandhi smells defeat in the coming loksabha election. he may continue with his abuse even after loksabha election. ,1
3867,i will never vote for congress or rahul gandhi ever in my life.,1
3868,rahul gandhi has never appologised for his remarks on hindu extremists as terrorists.,1
3869,i cannot accept a prime minister without a spine. so no i will never vote for congress or rahul gandhi and neither my family.,1
3870,and lastly i dont want my home to be taken away by illegal immigrants who will be welcomed by rahul gandhi for his vote bank.,1
3871,believe it or not india needs bjp now more than ever.,1
3872, ive never seen india developing during congress dynasty rule.,1
3873,now we can firmly say that india is developing. whole world is now looking india all the credit goes to modi,1
3874, ive never seen a person working so hard for the country as modi.,1
3875,its ridiculous to compare rahul with modi. most of the times rahul talks like a fool and got fooled himself.,1
3876,if bjp can uproot a party which looted country for years and is on the verge of extinction then tmc is no where in front of congress.,1
3877,the good thing about time is that it changes and yes that time has come tmc might win more seats than bjp but bjp will surely rise from to at least.,1
3878,lotus will blossom and it will maintain its trait of growing upon dirty water.,1
3879,bjp will rise tmc will fall.,1
3880,bjp is sure to win with even better mandate than .,1
3881, i will be voting for modi for shivraj for bjp for development.,1
3882,i think congress is disconnected from reality. it is palpable in the attitude of its local leadership,1
3883,it was modi who first instilled the dream of a new india that is strong beautiful and great. we all saw this dream of being in a deep sleep.,1
3884,perhaps it was mahadeva’s blessings that he instilled the fire in the eyes of india—a new india. the whole world saw it in the eyes of narendra modi,1
3885, the opposition parties including congress and all opportunistic regional parties will be defeated badly in the upcoming elections and the man of developing india will rise,1
3886,i think rahul gandhi will become pm sooner than later. the momentum is with him.,1
3887,modi government has failed miserably. they have renounced their development agenda and are playing the dirty politics of hate bigotry and warmongering,1
3888, bjp has created a toxic atmosphere of hatred and violence. they have empowered criminals and cronies. ,1
3889,putting together a team of finest economists social scientists and thought leaders congress has worked tirelessly for six months to prepare a plan for india.,1
3890,after reading the draft i realized that congress has nailed its manifesto. it is excellent and progressive. it addresses most of the problems we are facing today. ,1
3891,rahul gandhis transformation from an absentminded and reluctant politician to a formidable national leader is complete.,1
3892,the opposition and rahul gandhi will not be able to counter the bjps message on narendra modis strong leadership.,1
3893,narendra modi will continue as prime minister because with existing allies nda will have a majority. ,1
3894,the present political situation gradually and definitely becoming more and more pro bjp.,1
3895,my surmise is bjp is sure to land up with a haul of around to seats.,1
