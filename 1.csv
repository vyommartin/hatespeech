21,21,reconsidering st paragraph edit?i dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that im sure that the data are necessarily wrong. rather im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject. i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement. in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. a. benjamin cardozo a. learned hand b. john marshall harlan b. john marshall harlan iithe question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? i think not.perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale.at a minimum im questioning this edit? it deserves to be reconsidered. ,0

32,32,not at all you are making a straw man argument here. i never claimed odonohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position which is exactly what the quote says and also something odonohue agrees with. again i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd. the disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do. at the end of the day it is a value judgment as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement. if we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis. ,0

43,43,jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a rightwing force? as far as im aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all. the consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin hamish mcdonald roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show.the only dissenters im aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. for example even the foremost scholary expert on fascism and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy renzo de felice doesnt try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status. this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini. ,0

68,68,is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent? dont answer the questions beyond thatwell the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here. first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean really. second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand. id is just making up their numbers. finally your example has a>b where b was deliberate design. thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown. your a>b example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him. you dont have that with life on earth. you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test. so in that sense a>b is not scientific if youve never actually observed b. btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed. so in that sense no it isnt science. ,0

91,91,i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article theres a problem. either the history and characteristics should be expanded of the list should be culled. i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between and others...myself included. we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples. there we did trappist abbey and foreign. foreign includes all nonbelgium examples. this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia not a list. people can find lists anywhere and the article should reference this. also the style statistics are bad. when you say style statistics it sounds like a prescription not a description. an encyclopedia should follow the latter and if the former is used a citation should follow...and youll not find a valid one for this style in its country of origin.,0

97,97, czech republic is in central europe. the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions. especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region. countries are located within continents yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent. this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers. im tired of arguing with people who are essentially wikisquatters refusing to nudge on a given article. ... ,0

99,99,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized. however the term fossilized is not a very precise term. there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil. one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc. and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc. talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned.the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in? experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue. the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains. flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working. much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains. yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.,0

143,143,== attributing and classifying of personalities == invitation. your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed. some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here. i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word. necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania. we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat. renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us. cultural aspirations of the later nat. ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of lithuania. but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically lithuanian. i mean that such authors in as čiurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of lithuanian culture when in european or worldwide context. a parallel example may be taken from literature of india. poet tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india. making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture. but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones. this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n. ren. could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in lithuanian context. they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture. čiurlionis is the best example here. in other way the later lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life see the table below. we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramūnas bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism. period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period the younger generation approx – painter and composer čiurlionis painter kazys šimonis poet and philosopher vilius storastas vydūnas dramatist sofija kymantaitė čiurlionienė poets adomas jakštas motiejus gustaitis liudas gira composer stasys šimkus philosopher ramūnas bytautas. reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and postwar years. poets v mykolaitis putinas kazys binkis writer ignas šeinius – jurkūnas artists all ars group philosopher juozas girnius modernists introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life central european modernism. note lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence. jul utc,0

176,176,i dont at all propose that it should be transcribed as meːn in this or any other article. if anything at all just a brief mention of the raising of trap and mouth in a prenasal environment would suffice. i just thought it was an american thing to raise before nasals i do it myself but i often hear aussies do it quite a bit as well and i dont hear english people do it at all. the only difference is that americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it. im not really surprised you dont have a broad accent being a wikipedian. im not saying its not possible.youre right i was just kind of thinking aloud.,0
177,177,homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior. therefore they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay. in this way their way of life will be received as being not only harmless but perfectly normal. as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality. in this way it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being similar to a religion race or nationality. lestrade,0

182,182,a totallydisputed notice would probably be appropriate given the depth of disagreement that exists here but i cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article. slimvirgin has also used that wording recently but i rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice.to answer your second question my side has brought forward a proposal and the other side has not yet responded. this is sadly consistent with recent patterns of delay. ill make no comment on whether or not this is a deliberate strategy. ,0

190,190, randroide answers to next step guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation.i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software. i do not want that happenning.could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided?. thank you. randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something...of course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there. come oooooon boys start writing that section. i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me. but remember npov and sources all the sources. just like me citing el país in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb. cheers indeed a good point. and all the remarks in cope too. and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo. i agree with you % larean. what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely pov as is much of the rest of the proposed article. also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not. you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits... section.if you have not subscription to el país i am sorry but that´s your problem. my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el país and many many other publications and books. that´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss it´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.do you see?. the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources.btw if you write under a randroide answers section you areinvading my space. i do not mind really. but you are doing it.risking new truncations on your messages. to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections.if you think that the proposed article is pov work in it to make it npov. the article is not mine. ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short. the issue is not whether i subscribe to el país its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the articlevery funny southofwatford. i am going to follow this joke of yours.please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know? there is always someone without this or that book.delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home.delete all the references in spanish because did you know? there are users who know no spanish.it´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really. i had a good laugh.usersouthofwatford how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre. equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response. ,0

204,204,the organization of subtopics. culture is thrown way down towards the end after economy and tourism which is inappropriate. the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography which makes it not only uninteresting but also repetitive. information is interspersed all through the subsections without regard to whether or not they fit there. eg the geography section starts with the fact that up is the th largest state. that is not strictly geography and belongs in the introduction. climate belongs towards the latter part of the page perhaps before toursim. regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. in any case cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own because up has several interesting cities and regions each with specialities of its own like the copperware of moradabad ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi. in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before. ,0
205,205,i dont know the answer to this butlegally how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizens civil rights?i dont know if this is the section nelson was charged under in the federal case but if anyone could explain this i would appreciate it.you can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified thats really not my concern here since its a dead letter. im concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal. if the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice its not the first time. look at issei sagawa. part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isnt perfect and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted and that guilty people will be acquited from time to time. thats the price you pay for having a legal system in the end someone has to make the decision and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right. i dont think its going out on a limb to say that the sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.,0

286,286,...s rantpresently we are witnessing an open war against croatian dinaric culture. croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of conservative hdz party. croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergović refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players. some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all štokavian people and their culture are serbian. however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian. dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljević is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovićs book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje . also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in dubrovnik . even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijović kočan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijović kočan gusle glasnik may p. . dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatović a daughter of famous gusle player ante. although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry. not far from dubrovnik another coastal city makarska – was also a bastion of croatian gusle music. actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players. this mediterranean area also gave birth to andrija kačić miošić th century catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond. to honour kačićs work ivan meštrović the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kačić in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument. in addition to kačić makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music. according to dr. fra karlo jurišić who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banović zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovićkudrić and culminating with the most known mate banović – trliš . as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound. olinko delorko the researcher of dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of hvar. the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. english writer maude m. holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p.this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and hinterland. matija murko the researcher of this literary/music forms had reported that during his trips through dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredečki “hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme” željeznobeč p. now lets take a look at the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc. what do they have in common? of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost extinct. why do we have so few gusle players today ? is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture ? if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre,0

308,308,the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treatiesbaldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections. standfordham wrote to the king on october i saw mr baldwin who in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out? said yes but not on the campbell issue but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns. he sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the governments fall. ... ... and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwins strictures based on the campbell case – at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement achieved at a conference in london on the dawes plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the russian agreement. but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion. two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—middlemas and barnes p. . ,0

378,378, thanks. from my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts one parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. the difference is the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium race whatever race might be the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ethnicity. a second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history example the holocaust not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process. user nov. th ,0
379,379,well i see futperf is getting quite angry now insulting other editors also. and again their goal is make the point that the first bulgarian empire and the second bulgarian empire are not bulgarian or at least not related which helps their long term strategy for the invention of a macedonian nation and state think bulgarian tsar samuel etc. which existed from antiquity and the middle ages. thats it. tropcho correctly pointed out that direct political continuity is completely unimportant for the info box no other country cares for this in their info box neither spain germany ireland poland etc. what is important is to show how bulgaria formed thru the ages.,0

382,382,quoting hoppe first detailing kinsellas important pointsat this diff i put in the democracy section hoppes earlier comment first and followed with more about what kinsella said i.e.stephan kinsella writes that hoppes critics have accused hoppe of homophobia bigotry and the like based on these passages. kinsella wrote that that hoppes discussion of physically removing homosexuals and other groups only applied to private covenantbased communities centered around traditional values. he shared a letter hope wrote to him saying the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society.as i said in my edit summary just because some choose to totally take his comments about of context and attack him does not mean that wikipedia should be used for the same purpose. talkie talkie🗽 ,0

386,386,unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once. frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page. rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions. ,0

393,393,has anyone ever considered including tagteam edit warring as a rr violation? when two people act in tandem unintentionally or intentionally to make the same revert four times they may not technically violate the rr rule but they certainly do so in spirit. this was the problem on both sides in the edit war on the canada page and precisely what i wanted to avoid on the dominion page. would it not be easier to warn editors as you did here rather than shut down pages for weeks at a time as was done in the canada case? im sure this would cure the escalation problem without blocking access to pages. any comments on this?,0

403,403,biased unreliableemotionally written by armenin wiki editors==pls stop using the wikipedia for your dirty propaganda and lobbying purposes. there was no genocide. this is a amyth advanced by the armenian church and armenian fundamentalist fascists. a nation can not be subject to a egnocide when it has several heros for whom you can see statues in yerevan irevan. jews dont have it. the resolution is the act of some sold congressmen who want to appease the armenian lobby. it has no reliable valid and neutral content. it is kjust a piece of dirty and lie facts presented and written by christian missionaries working to kill turks and kurds in s. you can claim to be subject to genocide as much as you want. but this thing did never happen. some armenian fundamentalists and fascists who were killing kurds turks and azerbaijanis were killed by great sons of the turkic nation and i am proud of them. go and propogate your lie as much as you can. you will achieve nothing. raman==,0

433,433,in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims. it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp. the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue. this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.,0

468,468,apparently other editors agree that the edits i made were justified. a group of meatpuppets working as a team to revert an article to their own pov is what has caused this block. at issue was the advert tag which is justified was placed on the article by one editor replaced by me replaced again by another editor and replaced again by me. three editors so far have indicated the tag belongs there. im sure a forth editor is going to weigh in on this side too. the article is riddled with brochure language. please note that i was removing brochure language right up to the lockup of the article. theres still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed. additionally i dont believe i broke the rr rule which requires a fourth reversion. ,0
469,469,while i agree that indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying second there is no proof at all that the mighty sarasvati of the rigveda was in fact this now dry river the identification is itself open to doubt.. apart from there being facts/proof to indicate that saraswati did exist as this dry river including geological facts as to why it dried up the evidence also points to the fact that it was not a tributary of the indus refuting point of the passage quoted above and in fact drew the waters of the sutlej and the yamuna to be a river system of its own. and though a large number of sites have been found along this river system none of them are of the scale of harrapa / mohenjodaro leaving the indus valley tag as the correct one. saraswati did existtoday the timing is disputed and not the existence wheter it is vedic and indic vs harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than its existence.,0

474,474,all of those statements need to be referenced. leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information. to point out one thing ill bring up consolidated appropriations act . first it has a number of tags on it the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag. second the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that. it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link. its possible that some came from this as well i cant tell. ill also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic so the article is riddled with grammatical errors mostly incomplete sentences. on creation the opening read consolidated appropriations act h.r. is a bill passed to the th united states congress ive never heard this usage to rather than by and assume it is incorrect another editor changed it the lead is also missing an important determiner. in any case you can take a look at  vesey ,0

494,494, tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and u.s. jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. i appreciate that the situation in the u.s. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech. to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city. in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas. saying that dla has has offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china ... would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research. i do accept that dla with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible. ,0
495,495,no problem with that at all if you dont think that there is a problem with someone siting that i have a mistress then it just proves my point as to how far this site is to being an actual encyclopedia. its a forum not an encyclopedia. big difference. and thats not even what pisses me off the most about my page. thank god im single with no chick bitching me out or that would be another attorney fee id be handing out to sue whoever owns this site. im done bitching about the mistress thing. my whole page has errors from the very first line down to the very last line and that is no joke first line and the last line are wrong.,0

498,498,speedy deletion of andrew takao a tag has been placed on andrew takao requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a person or group of people but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subjects importance or significance may be deleted at any time. please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable as well as our subjectspecific notability guideline for biographies. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. ,0

501,501,nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time. the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it. he/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed his/her mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on was on him/her not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago ... decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that. does or add clutter? sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt he/she even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about / of the entire article dealt with norman schwarzkopf an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaith/goodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles. he/she was involved in blocking input to the article. why? was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying. i dont really have time for this. i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles. i could pretend this user didnt do what he/she did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense. i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative. as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles. the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. also i dont recal ever having called him/her a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently. his/her behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems. i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper he/she isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english. i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon. nothing new under the sun here. if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all. i know whats going on. i dont know why but i dont have to and i expect the motivations arent interesting. respond if you have anything to say. ,0

526,526, question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question i dont pay much attention to that page. in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. i havent yet worked in no original research. wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i dont see how that can be objective. bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al. but ive been somewhat overloaded at work. personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob. yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note i appreciate it i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication. ive never done any such thing. or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequencesive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isnt namecalling by a long stretch. im really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me wont make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. its the internet equivalent of stoning. this is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly. putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult. ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response. and please notice like abi avi is avraham the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness i counseled against piling on. talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen. yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite. thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh,0

570,570, philosopher rfc philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead. this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career. note not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present. the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place. definitions obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article. philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ... anarchocapitalist anarchocapitalism ... is a political philosophy... voluntaryist voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy... athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy... primary source as stefan molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims. if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place. i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to. freedomain radio about page my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens. i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio. i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy. freedomain radio the show that molyneux hosts has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly universally preferable behaviour upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods? a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies. strong atheism the case for evacuating the middle ground article why i am a philosopher? video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy. an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts reality knowledge truth gods/religion ethics and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable. proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video philosophy questio,0

591,591, wikipediaarticles for deletion/cheongye kwan your post at the above afd on a new martial art bothers me. this was the version at the time that you based your post on. you posted i just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines... it is reliably sourced... since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied... it now has independent sources. and to refute the argument posed by wayne it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised.please consider the concerns this post raises. simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin. in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. i dont have a word for it. unreal is close.the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability. the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website. a casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny < sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too. the lau philip la interview. entries marked reference and support of written reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence. a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper.in brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal i think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited and/or written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall.your assessment of these at afd was it is reliably sourced{ style=borderccc solid px width=% there is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts. probably via selfpromotional input. there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.} that the cited pages are evidence of notability{ style=borderccc solid px width=% they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it?} that the sources are independent{ style=borderccc solid px width=% are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host} that the cites show it is nonlocalized{ style=borderccc solid px width=% the page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it. the reference openly stated cambridge university and bristol taekwando a big indication of its actual source when a link was provided on request it turns out it,0

597,597, stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments. i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information. the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here. there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain. the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group i.e. hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view. hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy. thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons. for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia. this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different. still it is dissapointing. happy trails. ,0

599,599,accents although the cartoon established mario and luigi to be from brooklyn a fact commonly accepted by fans despite having never been mentioned in any games toad seemed to speak with a thicker brooklyn accent. the accents werent mentioned in the games but the tv show was presumably a licensed product. until nintendo decided to go with an italian accent fans assumed the tv show and later the movie accent was the official standing. only when nintendos products included digitized recorded speech did anyone realize nintendo intended them to be italian not italianamerican. its the same principle of updated canon that star trek and star wars licensed products run on.,0

622,622,i do not see any antisemitism here. if the guy gives lectures in new york synagogues and knocks down his country every single minute using every opportunity in such influential newspapers as new york post then one can state that his interests are not only personal. you can not find any intellectual person among neoconservatives in new york post. michelle malkin andrea peyser deborah orin may her rest in peace although i know she is rotting in helland other essayists are the ones who make a great company for amir taheri. this guy has no mind at all. i agree that irans regime is wrong but the regime of shah that amir taheri is longing for because he owned keyhan during that regime was not any better and islamic revolution was justified. look at how they intriduce amir taheri in both this article and in new york post. based in europe memeber of benador associates. is europe that small? is that a small town? why dont they say based in the world journalist. or may be he is having a breakfast in london with christian amanpour and james rubin eating lunch in jerusalem and having some lectures and dinner with anti irani jews in forest hills new york in between emailing his full of hatred articles to new york post. isnt this stupid? how can you saysomebody is based in europe or asia or africa?,0
623,623, why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.i reject such a stance. i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial. where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth. this is wrong. wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is. any attempt to do that is original research.instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability. put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources. if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that. if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict. where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or pov on the topic at hand.i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. obviously is because some users jadger and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their pov thats not discussion about the npov edits. thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ ,0
624,624, regarding loyalmoonie and lgbt categories looked into it and this editor seems to be pushing an antilgbt agenda. theyve done similar stuff over at sailor moon and made officiallooking warnings to other editors. this quote is bizarre and is quite telling to insert those categories would ultimately give other people who may not even support the lgbt movement reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy sailor moon is a homosexual and/or supports ssm. i dont personally watch/read sailor moon or know much about it so im not confident enough to readd the categories but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless and there is a sourced part in the article about female ,0

631,631,agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. i was concentrating on the polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the czech experience needs to be included. czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s had closer ties with the west than poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was the west politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with poland. that said i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland the baltics yugoslavia or even ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea. while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war i think that the articles focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. after all there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union too who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy. oct utc,0

678,678,i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth’s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. i think that the img reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty. i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teethbut bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article. i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by offriorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth’s biography. perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which i suspect should not be difficult—that it can be reincluded? i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment. actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle. ,0
679,679, greek love im looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. im leaving a note here because you closed this afd where i made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. there are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp. i complain here about their coordination. other editors including and i simply cant do it any longer. i havent changed my position on the validity of the article but ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided. im done. i need to limit my time on wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. when ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it. im not asking you to do anything im just explaining why i cant keep my word as given at the afd. wow that is a no hard feelings on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. i have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world. sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore. best of luck in your future endeavors here. mailchimp im not that bothered but i think that the mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake. it did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance something that was supposed to be the original problem. the criteria specifies a credible claim of significance. wordpress pages are not reliable sources. however i would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today. talkback talk just a hunch?call it my intuition but im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does. just my cents. cheers ♠♣♥♦™№©♪♫® there are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy. if you have any evidence of socking file at wpspi. recreation of article shay carl i would like to request that the article shay carl be recreated see the deleted talkshay carl for my reasons note talkshay carl was delete because of a not notibility. well there was,0

695,695,my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. that was like the nd day almost two months ago.all of my references are nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation. i didnt put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge.i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. for instance i wrote to the aba and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article. i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view. those references were deleted by someone i cant remember who and dont know why. at this point the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid transcript. the guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers. even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for. i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.i dont believe that i did any original research. all i did is search the internet for references for the article. i really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article. i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf which date back to . also when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst.i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway. same as the u.n. covenantcant really hide that. i didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously. like today i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which i think is because of judge learned hand who was in the fifth circuit. and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se no there was not. what i found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly.i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing. i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. ive been an entrepreneur. i didnt know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article. that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article. the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article.arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself. one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i havent got it yet. but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state slave state border state. also there were issues related to indians in some of the western states. the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too i think. so did the history of workmens comp which is of course related to unions. ,0

706,706,referring to her as catherine i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone living or dead by their st names on wp if a female had a title she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy or lady dudley for amy robsart even though lady amy was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become lady dudley until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amys life nor was she then lady amy dudley as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke. i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just amy throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles but was told it was against wp rules though i wasnt pointed to a link for it. noblewomen are usually called by their st names round here as far as i can see even when they have surnames are not of something mary boleyn is called mary not lady carey or lady stafford catherine neville is called catherine not the duchess of norfolk etc theyre not royals. as for males i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley. i was banging head on keyboard going but no one just says the king all the time or refers to them as plantagenet or keeps changing their titles ie henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as catherine throughout the article without her title appended? ive only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me as my main interest is british history i am quite confused.,0

708,708,they are all cunts its not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue. all sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never ever change. they advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know. soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites independent information in general will be extinguished. wikipedia a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science. the new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to crosscheck facts through other perspectives. with few small independent sites left with no or few free university pages left real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them ...,0

719,719,dect isnt really a new technology. its a newer standard but tdm/tdma/fdma digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of dect. dect is itself a successor to ct japans phs is very similar and of course gsm damps and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. to suggest there are special health issues with dect would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. dect is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces both during transmissions and inherently because even when in use the td nature of the system means the system isnt transmitting continuously.as i believe ive said before there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of lowpower radio technology and there being a link in the see also section of this article to it. that article of course should look nothing like the section i yanked. there is nothing about dect however that merits a special section on dects dangers especially when new technology or otherwise there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.,0

743,743,words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propagandadamemk you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia.userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not.he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia.how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda.hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources.i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals.i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports.damemk i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkdamemk and usertalkejanev is not the same user. some insight into my user name ejanevthe only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev. it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev.user damemk is a separate user. probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia.it does happen that i am from canada. i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years.and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia.i am not the only user/editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles.you can watch the contributions of specialcontributions/laveol and see that more than % of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes. ,0

767,767,i accept your comment in the spirit in which it is offered. terminology matters and it can be hard to find the correct word. it was another editor who sought to distinguish civilised behaviour from that of indians my point was that even if one accepts such a distinction nonindians have committed absurdly large atrocities. in addition i could have pointed to the mystic massacre as a completely onpoint example of a butchery that shocked our native population. nonetheless both tribal mongols and tribal american indians had or have civilizations by any reasonable definition. ,0

770,770,replacementplease do not edit below this note. the whole suprasection will disappear again once i am able to post on the article talk page.this includes you shell. had you not blocked me i would have been able to place my answers there. this will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.because shell falsely blocked me i cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. hence i will save the entire page minus the archived sections here. pov concerns im surprised this article isnt being called antisemetic because its has a few traces of islamic perspectives in it. you know as opposed to being a piece of zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.this entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. it is well documented the banu qurayza were executed for treason. that is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason. the quarash and other tribes the muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. but the qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy. this article contains soo much jewish propaganda that youd think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim. here is a great example. look at this citationaccording to stillman muhammad chose sad ibn muadh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the banu qaynuqa and the banu nadir sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. furthermore stillman infers from abu lubabas gesture that muhammad had decided the fate of the qurayza even before their surrender.this author is norman a stillman a zionist jew who is very biased. why is he being used as a quote in an islamic article? and further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if its a fact?there are articles for criticisms of islam where the jews and others can write whatever they want. but they should have no hand in editing islamic articles. because i looked up the jewish articles and i noticed they dont allow dissent there. you cant put a muslim perspective on evil acts commited by jews without it disappearing instantly. so the same standard must be applied to islamic articles. islamic articles must be written from the islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of islam articles. if not i will personally edit the jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. and i will find a nonjewish admin to arbitrate over the islamic articles.good day. please read this talk page specifically all of the places where treason or traitor is mentioned and if you still believe that we need to mention treason provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it. it is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all povs but it does require that people like yourself participate. we work from academic sources not personal conjecture. changes by devotus and issues with themdear devotus i have still issues with your changesbat yeor and ramadan while i appreciate that you dont try you shift the balance removing a book from each side i do not agree with your removal. bat yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial she is not beyond the pale currently she doesnt serve as a reference in the article but if she did the controversy would be noted. as for ramadan i have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section we would have to remove him from the article too in which he serves as a reference. this is due to the insistence of userbless sins. he will certainly not like such a removal. we cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.while your first version was needlessly verbose it is to be noted that the new one endorses that view by paret/watt. the article now says that the bq were not killed for religious reasons that is not a fact since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the siege and demise e.g. the claim about attacking m. in the rear.also please abide by the one resolved conflict. we fought hard and long about words like massacre and execution and neither should appear unless unavoidable.the common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s,0

778,778, on mohammed albayatis qualifications with regards to the edits over the past day i think that while mohammed albayatis qualifications are tangentially relevant the purpose of the text as they are placed right now is to prove that mohammed albayati is not qualified to review the autopsy report. this i think violates npov. if the qualifications are to be included they should come under the criticism and controversy section quoted by whoever it is that accused mohammed albayati of not being qualified to review the autopsy report is cited. if nobody made the accusations then this is original synthesis and should again be removed. ,0

794,794, mediation hello i am atyndall and i have volunteered to take on your mediation case during this discussion i will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. after having a look at the discussion above this is what i have foundquizzicalbee has been adding the sentence according to chesler the the u.s. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a u.s. citizen. hurmata has been reverting this back to she reports that the u.s. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. hurmata objects to quizzicalbees sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. qb objects saying that maybe in the s us citizenship could have been revoked by the us/afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. hurmata countered that the citation threat qb was referring to is not the one that was cited. qb states that there is no evidence disproving her claims so they are valid.could the involved users please place below to verify that this statement is correct or suggest why it is not correct? thankyou    talk  ,0
795,795,well arthur i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what says it is not your correction. it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless.you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. so lets do that.we want a function f satisfying f=e and fn+=expfn defined as widely as possible. we observe that n= and n= present no problems f= and f=.to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as .and we want f to be continuously differentiable. the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on . this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because a=e.next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f is monotone on the interval . from the functional equation fx = ln fx+ we get f x = f x+/fx+. hence f =f /f=f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx = expxexpxx.thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and .,0

803,803,lol you know what i meant. whichever president came before hafez i just new he was president before assad has considerable foreground of support in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. they would have claimed instability would arise as assads supporters are trying to use in their defense. what i am trying to say is that although bashar assad had good economic and international policies for syria you should not fear a nonbaathist potentially being elected. syrias economic and international policies wont change iran would still be a major factor in syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms and for the better. also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. the muslim brotherhood in syria is weak even weaker than the islamist prescence in libya. the rebels in libya had % support as we see now and yet could hardly take control without nato. what chance does the syrian muslim brotherhood have? none. if anything nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the muslim brotherhood making them less of an influence in the everyday life of syrians. as you know i am pro syria and armenia just not pro assad. unlike armenia where people like sargsyan and kopcharyan were democratically elected assad was not no one ran against him because they were not allowed.,0

806,806,{{unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine. why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?. for exampleand this is... yep maybe you guessed it... question why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name... like say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor? specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid?. heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor?. ready for one more? then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment ?. oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking rr that says that but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense? well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say? well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give her/him a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingright/matchingconsensusisnodefense rule?... ,0

843,843,speedy deletion of david fork a tag has been placed on david fork requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia. this has been done under section a of the criteria for speedy deletion because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. please see wikipediastub for our minimum information standards for short articles. also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but dont hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedias policies and guidelines. what do u want? ,0
844,844,your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per wikipedia guidelines until jayjg and slimvirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article and reverting it to what we have now as punitive gestures. if we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better instead of punishing each other there is no reason the article has to be locked.i agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on. however a definition doesnt do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information. if there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism that would be better than no definition at all intimidate for instance. ,0
845,845,speaking without knowing what im talking about? ok how bout this the original comment i made about everlasts entry constantly being vandalized by eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site. the feud started with the dilated peoples track. thats why i believed that the verse everlast contributed should be in there and still do. the jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. it belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it everlast would knock the living shit outta eminem. and that came off an eminem fan site.,0

853,853,you said i am determined that the page will not regress to this again and i will delete anything inappropriate that jeopardizes the good progess that is now being made. a completely inappropriate post in the middle of a sensitive discussion threatens to do just that. the problem is that you are not the sole arbiter of this or any talk page. the post was innocuous and did not violate the conditions of the arbitration decision. nor did it affect the flow of discussion on the page. in fact the most appropriate response would have been to just ignore it. by removing it you just encourage a reaction. you accuse me of wikilawyering which is absurd. the guidelines are there to help us all. however not only do you violate that guideline but also several policies. it is this kind of heavy handed action that encourages people to persist with problem edits. it is a longstanding convention that we do not remove other users posts and in my three years here i have never seen it done when it wasnt vandalism. unless you can give me a much better reason for not doing so i am going to reinstate the deleted text. ,0

875,875, bloc voting countries with large populations of nonnationals may have their televote influenced considerably. this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia. this is fullblown crazy. what does nonnationals mean? these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa. people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries there are some refugees in each of those countries but that doesnt really explain why croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to serbia or macedonia to serbia where there was no conflict to speak of. for example im a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual. but im not a bosnian nonnational. i have the passport of bih and my family has never lived in serbia in history. its really about mutual intelligibility which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. its the language and sensibility.,0

908,908,dunfermline article and new pictures for the kirkcaldy collage hello again. ive been looking at the paragraph about the kingsgate shopping centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the s specifically between and if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years. but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway. about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources.also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference kingsgate extension on schedule for august opening by mivan. as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status. thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the kingsgate and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date. that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to mutt luckers home page. it is now on his talk page if you want to see it mutt lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the beveridge park pond. as well as this i have another new picture of the old kirk tower which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website the clock has been restored since that pic. and would like to upload it.,0

931,931,ive done some cleanup adding a mention of l as the series main antagonist to the lead. i cant agree that the episode count is insignificant given that what were dealing with is how prominent the characters are to the story more than that i cant agree that l is absent from the second arc. yes hes dead hes not physically present but the characters refer to him constantly. his influence pervades the arc as is shown by numerous quotes and so on. its like saying jesus has no relevance to pauls epistles because he was dead at the time.,0

936,936,thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously. to reiterate my original explanatoin to james im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about. for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article. see for example something like roe v. wade theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case. even if you really consider moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of godwins law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be. similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there? jul utc,0

959,959,this is untrue. i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true. it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me. usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing. the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false. i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently. having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulent..ism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me etc. is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate. in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so. although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc. that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system.there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this.you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc. so that is also impossible.                       ,0

986,986,as you kinow it yourself you are not elligible nor credible nor a reliable source of neutrality in this case as you are yourself a mormon and all you do is to support other mormons without following any wikipedias rules but your own churchs solidarity.i dont believe that any of you has even the intention of being straightforward with non mormon or to be a little bit honest but that the alone thing that activate you is your own religious believe and the pedantisme to think that all you may say or do is auto righteous in the name of the church and all the illusions you dream of with open eyes.i dont want a mormon admi i dont want a mmormon admi i dont want a mormon admi to look into this case but an exterm¨n al one with no relations nor conacts what so ever with this church nor its representants or members.if you cant do that must be because your circle of admi friends is around the church or because you know very deeply that all you did was deeply unappropriate and wont stand a micro mile in a wiki trail.i am mad very mad at you also because you ignore what i have say so why should i care about your saying and doing if we have to be neutraly equal?any idea?i want the text who was deleeted from the archive it is unacceptable that a text is deleeted from archive and from the edit history just one hour after it was reverted and less than a day after it was written without any previous warning of any kind about it.this is all about wiki rules and you have broken them all.,0

995,995, july utcwell yes thats fine but the point here is that there is no publishers statement made about anything in that sentence. the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. if the resource says joe at worms then we write joe ate worms. about tarnishing any reputation that isnt the point at all. and about accepted practices in the publishing world this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. about people keeping records of how many books were published i think you missed the point there. publishers weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. they are a secondary source. do you see how thats different? about the article on fip it hadnt any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted. the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here. fip and are the same entity. facim is also the same entity. this is known. having the same board of directors as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim® etc. makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources. ,0

1038,1038, can someone explain criticism to me? this is taken from the criticisms section of the article. since logic is inherently constant and that some things are more true than others it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. an example of a similar phenomenon is the gay marriage debate in the u.s. an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. can someone explain what exactly this means? i do not follow the first half of the paragraph the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me especially this part...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesnt apply to them as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.i do not think thata the majority in question believes that it doesnt apply to them. though im not sure what it is in this context so the sentence may be true. the majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society which of course applies to everybody in that society.b the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views. its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed for the benefit of society it is aware of the effects and does not object to them. ,0

1060,1060,and paganismsouthgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university rejected catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition’ including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a ´ satru´ alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party. further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins. southgate believed that wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity’. another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate roman emperor julian ii.this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’. the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmler’s ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’ the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’. for southgate as for evola tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene. this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothicindustrial dark ambient black and ‘viking’ metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth. although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging ‘antiantiestablishment’ probush rightwing punk movement. although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’. southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.this is not simply cynical manipulation. southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. his fanzine tribal resonance ‘the voice of the racial avantgarde’ reveals southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’. through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’ southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance. by creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.the struggle for cultural heg,0

1063,1063,ok ill try to sort through your latest post here. let me know if i misinterpret something.first you specify a theory axiomatic system namely zfcp+ppomega exists. lets call that t for easy reference.now you argue that t proves the existence of a model lets call it m the because its not a model of t but of a new theory such thatm satisfies zfcppomega is in m. now do you mean the real pomega or do you mean that m satisfies pomega exists that is that theres an element of m that m thinks is pomega? im guessing the latter that m satisfies pomega exists.you say aleph is in the model and is less than or equal to the cardinality of pomega. again im guessing you mean that this is in the models opinion that is m satisfies the statement exists and .ok so going with my guesses thus far i agree that t proves the existence of such an m. m might be for example mg where m equals which is a model for t and g is mgeneric for the partial order to add cohen reals.,0

1074,1074,justin vaisses opinionthis relative absence of frenchamerican political and social unity helps to explain antifrench sentiment in the united states. french historian justin vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward france in the united states is the small number of americans of direct french descent. while he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of antifrench sentiments he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. vaïsse contends that by comparison the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. he proposes that as france has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it it is socially and politically acceptable in the united states to express negative sentiments of the frenchpierre verdaguer a turnofthecentury honeymoon? the washington posts coverage of france french politics culture society vol. no. summer . just to answer ive read before that the proportion of french descendant in the us is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the new world at the same time as the brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly they were mixed into the mainstream america. however its true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they dont represent or try to represent. ,0

1103,1103, hello hi blu aardvark glad to see you did not permanently leave wikipedia. i was wondering why my templatecurrent event template redirect wasnt working couldnt see the obvious — talk  z thanks thanks for taking note of the arcata eye and plazoid pages. happy birthday have a great day talk admin fighterthat was really funny gave me a good chuckle. you should have just crossed it out and left it in. talk removing religious and political categories. recent attempt at vote stacking leaves a bad taste in my mouth. were you referring to this wikipediaadministrators noticeboard/incidentscatholic alliance of wikipedialike vote stacking? α⇔ω ¦ ⇒✉ no. i was referring to a wikipedia email i recieved earlier today sent by now. policy proposal hi you recently commented on bibleverse articles and may therefore be interested in commenting about a proposed policy covering roughly specific verseswikipediacentralized discussion/verses of kings and ubuntu logo blui noticed you changed the logo for the ubuntu linux user box. why? the usage policy on ubuntus offical site clearly allows for such use. besides the logo is just that a lowresolution image of a logo which is allowed under fair use. i am aware that some discussion has been going around about fair use images in user boxes. if you changed the logo to tux because i labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information im sure i can find an appropriate image copyright tag. at the time i had changed it several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace per wikipedia policy. the ubuntu trademark policy may allow it but wikipedia policy per wpfu is to limit images that are not available for commercial use which the ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows. talk contribs the preceding text was copied from user talkjcarrollwpnpaplease review and adhere to wpnpa wpciv and wpwqt. please re?familliarize yourself with wikipedia policy. thanks in advance. i am fully aware of the above policies thank you. i do not feel that it can be considered a personal attack or incivil to call a troll a troll. im sorry if you dont agree with me in that but that does not mean that my statement is a violation of any of the above policies. talk contribs it is a violation and you must refrain from it. wpnpa is nonnegotiable. funny. nobody considers it a violation of wpnpa to call userwilly on wheels a vandal. nobody con,0

1127,1127,no. it does not. the infobox clearly says they are gone. but this discussion is old every now and then someone says if we write x someone might assume y. the consensus is we cant hold ourselves responsible for what people wrongly assume out of their own volition. if we write x someone might also assume w and z too. we can further clarify in the article body but turning this infobox into a copy of the infobox on internet explore article or whatever comes last surely isnt the way to go.still if you are not convinced you can proceed with wpdr. call wpo or something. best regards ,0

1129,1129, silesians andrew i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia. i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project. assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. i inquired about silesian/polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist. good luck with the article. olessi thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion. you are right that the work of a person is most important.however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace. if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up. to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist. i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition. seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german/silesian/polish guy. it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well. so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement.with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned. for some to hundred years there were under german governments. they had bad time as you possibly can imagine. many of them married with german and were/are of course confused who they are. you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued. finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. there in poland was complete disorder. soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way. “national” government just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. polish borders were shifted. we lost some % of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland. you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people. they spoke different polish dialect also. on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately i am. this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally. thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much. i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans.now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations.finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often naïve. not many realize that politic need caution. those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers. i am also convinced there exists something like national character. you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own.returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column on polish terytory in addition.sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich i still have with ge wiki. they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. that sucks.sorry and thanks again. feel free to contact me any time you need.best regards andrew december,0

1133,1133,banging your head against a wall hi i see jayjg has been leaving messages on your page with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness. in reality jayjg is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light. along with many of his cohorts.the problem is that jayjg is part of the wikipedia cabal. when there were elections despite massive efforts to the contrary a number of people got a higher vote percentage than jayjg but jimbo wales put him on arbcom anyhow. jimbo has shown his true colors as well.these people control wikipedia. they are all together and attacking you. no one is coming to your aid. this is because they control wikipedia with jimbo at the center and have more or less driven off everyone else. you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up disorted justified etc. anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here.my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative like a wiki encyclopedia that is not prozionist and antimuslim like this one. or if you do continue here for a little bit to spend less time. it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than . eventually you will give up here everyone does. you are fighting a losing battle.,0

1156,1156,first of all theres no need at all to apologise about discussing your dispute here. secondly i think it would be a good idea or actually an essential step in solving the dispute to back off from this for a few days maybe even a week. as youve been backandforthing for months already another week cant possibly hurt. youll find that walking away and editing some articles unconnected with farming or with animal welfare will help put this whole hill of beans into its true perspective. it will give us time to find other better or at least more widely acceptable images to use. after i am ready i will start a new section in article talk where we can take this matter forward and arrive at a solution we can all live with. how does that sound?,0

1172,1172,wrong licensesi have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. the exceptions areimagewankhede on the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free creative commons licenses but failed to actually change the licensing. image concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a creative commons license as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. as such the photo may not be used on wikipedia except perhaps under fair use policy which probably doesnt apply or under panorama freedom depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic.image image description page implies that it is licensed for noncommercial use only contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia. in addition the link to the original source which could clarify which condition is correct of the image is missing.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved. image to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim the author should probably email the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.image the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons noderivative license a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia either.image no evidence of the image being under a free license.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved.image flickr page states all rights reserved.image creative commons noderivative license.image all rights reserved.image creative commons attribution noncommercial noderivative license unacceptable on wikipedia.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image all rights reserved.image the link to the original source is missing no evidence that it is under the creative commons license.image taken from wikitravel. uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.image who made this image?there are several issues here. there are multiple creative commons licenses not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia. in particular licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and cant be used on wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy creative commons atrribution and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay. also there are multiple versions of the licenses creative commons atrribution sharealike . . . and . are all distinct licenses. the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the . versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older licenses you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. as far as i can see flickr only uses the . versions of the licenses.in addition some of the flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient either. you should ask the authors to do one of the followingchange the flickr page to license the image under creative commons attribution or attribution sharealike license apparently this would change the licensing for all images and this may not be what they intend to dopost a message to the image page with a text similar to the followingi creator of the image agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license link alternately under the creative commons attribution sharealike license link. this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.email the wikimedia foundation permissionsenatwikimediadotorg with a message similar to the above also specifying which image images the user intends to release under the license. this would be the best choice if the author doesnt want to reveal his identity on wikip,0

1177,1177, israelipalestinian conflict protect? yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this. it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc. wiki articles i have referenced why not this one? thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints. and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict. it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus. i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic. you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased. do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source? please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous. if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers. there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise. i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks. apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page. i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on wiki saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see. repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive. protection is not an endorsement of the current version. zman the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. clearly there is something seriously wrong. as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan. worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes. if the events at this article really offend you it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk ,0

1190,1190,how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? also just because a word has a historical meaning doesnt mean that it cant ever mean anything else as culture develops. the word rap meant to knock as on a door up until the late s for example. would you deny the more modern use of the term? the english language has no board to regulate it as french does with the lacadémie française so you have no basis for defining what the word means. we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like youre and your for example but none such for words like bukkake. if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way that is valid. my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier gay just as there is no need to call men having anal sex gay anal sex but thats really irrelevent. i think it is important to make clear the historical implications but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything but specifically semen and specifically onto a persons face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it. ,0

1235,1235,im back. i already created id occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class c when i do i collected a massive number of diff edits on balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is on record getting blocked for saying this about greeks under a previous handle. not to mention his personal talk page is one big antigreek rant fest pointing to questionable fyrom news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titlesno assfuckers has a nice ring to it d use it as a pejorative term. i was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin futper and a few others e.g. macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antigreek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking im going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. as for the current naming disputing article... i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i dont think that reduces the existential threat to greece. communism fell years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left. there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately. i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasnt greek i didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didnt think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. assuming you see it as relevant yourself of coursefebruary the fyroms president kirov gligorov at an interview by the foreign information service daily report easten europe stated we are slavs who came to the region in the sixth century. we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians.january the fyroms ambassador in washington d.c. mrs. ljubica acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great. we are slavs and we speak a slavic language. greece is the fyroms second largest trading partner and its number one investor.february the fyrom.s ambassador to canada gyordan veselinov in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great. we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian. there is some confusion about our identity.i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior. he directly contradicts fyroms own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognitionprime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan who claims to be related to alexander the great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient macedonians. and dont get me started on that incident where gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of united macedonia was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article,0

1243,1243,articles ive just deleted the bugrr team or however that was spelled and notice other deletion requests on other articles here. i also read your note on that articles talk page and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of wikipedia. we only allow articles on subjects that are notable generally this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple independent reliable sources. that means that a company thats just recently started that has never produced a product and that by the way those were written seem closer to a group of friends is not a suitable subject for a wp article. basically if you cant find a number of newspaper etc. articles discussing the company it shouldnt have an article. i hope this explains why these articles were deleted.in connection to this i need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type. continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators and these are clearly nonnotable companies so much so that we used the expedited speedy deletion process.,0

1258,1258,outdent how about looking at it like this. rpg rulebooks are just that. the rulebook explains how to play the game but it is not the game itself. the isbn manual you reference below supports this games shall not be given isbns. there may be some confusion in the matter but one good example is found by harking back to ad nd ed. to play that game required it being rules heavy that really is pretty much true a minimum of two books—the dm guide and the players handbook. neither contained the game and the game went far beyond what was in either. the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books magazine articles supplements pamphlets online articles and what was in the head of the players. the book is about the game it is not the game. for that matter a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn so you cant really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn. a publisher doesnt mean its a book as board games computer games and any number of things are published and have publishers. ,0

1282,1282, i was thinking about this last night and came to two conclusions first focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor if possible to global warming and denialism. dont tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous.. second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions. join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate. and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert. done the page is impregnable. take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer. using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end. barbara boxer is a politician. every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both. even more — and this is important — barabara boxer is not a runofthemill politician. it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. in short the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what? test. i intend to delete that one sometime soon too. i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thankyou to the editors who revert me every time they do so. or maybe a barnstar? i dunno some token of gratitude or other. •  ,0

1299,1299,you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors.under wikipedia policy under the rr rule it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and/or help improve the article. there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors. that is to leave the rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page youll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion without explanation without stating their objections first without submitting their proposed changes to peer review and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreedupon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.,0

1404,1404,re your ae topic ban appealsorry but it strains credulity mine anyway to believe that you didnt realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are wellacquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save as you state here . recent article/talk page history . you havent edited the article since and you must have thousands of other articles that need improvement on your watchlist. you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard re this as you have for many articles during the past few months.in my view the a.m. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcomingness. the remainder of the appeal in which you speak of wps losses from your lack of participation thats a different story that others can think over. if you remove the a.m. section i shant contest your appeal since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesnt make much difference in the long run. but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. you could either remove that section since it hasnt been commented on there yet or strike it. if you choose not to do either i may bring it up at the ae appeal. id prefer that we keep the conversation here but if youd rather have it on my talk page thats ok by me if so ill post talkbacks.,0

1412,1412,deleted response to comments on wikipedia talkwikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. in this particular case the discussion was started by user brad who made a personal comment about me. now i dont mind this i was more curious than offended but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talknaming conventions ships‎. you claimed that my post which you deleted was a pov inserted into a neutral notice. it may have been a pov about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable. it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting. if you are going to start censoring postings then i would suggest you do so impartially. you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice but merely removed one comment. rather than restoring impartiality this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.far better that you do not delete anyones comments. i would suggest reading wikipediano personal attacks. im not sure what deleting others posts comes under try wikipediaetiquette.,0

1428,1428,pretty much what i said the first day this was posted. now i have neither a problem with the cabals decision nor in the cabals logic as deamon does. my concern is why a vote that basically said i dont know means it stays at burma. by the cabals conclusion...if the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation and we had the same cabal it would now be a myanmar article. i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy. however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision? you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma. husond is right where does this end? when i first looked at this mess i said and posted that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. there are good points for each argument. im in the burma camp but that is how i see things. so im looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. choice just doesnt look that appealing. ,0

1459,1459,with respect you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. getting off the subject a little but it does have some relevance the nz herald routinely refers to nzers of european descent as pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. of course i would not include this in any article and defintely not this one without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of hits for rooster found in nz media. many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry. clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the countrys readership than poultry.just stating both cockerel and rooster are used is factual whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.also i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both cockerel or rooster are common.,0

1490,1490,janettedoe i appreciate your finding and uploading the rao articles. however this can easily become an endless discussion. for some other yadavapologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than rao and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the yadav apologists are not and have no intention aware or unaware of being—will go scurrying again for the article. after that we all will try to interpret it weighing the pros and cons again to a degree the apologists will not for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path. i think we cant make the determination of whether rao applies here or not at least not yet. let the secondary sources do that. we need to rely on recent scholarship especially that in textbooks published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds. two such books by susan bayly and christophe jaffrelot both widely used in universities around the world both reviewed extensively in the literature are being used in the article. let the article writing or rewriting proceed based on these or similar books. once the article has been fleshed out we can come back to the issue of rao. otherwise nothing will get done and those of us whove taken time out from our other wikipedia not to speak rl pursuits to attend to the article will slowly walk away out of touch and out of sympathy. «talk» ,0

1495,1495,rsa labss now emc mit and acm are wrong? vquaker. i am used to accepting correction when it is due but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source rsa labs on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing. i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know it must be spurious. some people know that its better to get their legal information from government sources not wikipedia. if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide exposition or sanctioned resource then i believe the u.s. government would like to hear your ideas. further someone you know or knows you is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance. needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat. though i suspect you know this already. im not offended though just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard. i would ask you this if a user loses their smartcard i.e. cac and forgets their password with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person? there are organizations that will terminate you but i couldnt have said that in my expounding of the th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge. when we set out it was to provide reliable information if the mission has changed well who could tell? consider me a noncontributor from now onwe arent allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work it is an anathema. say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. i should expect nothing less after all i teach. what changed the tone was your dumbingdown and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone. smell? nonsequitur. you gave me things to read but im still waiting for you to cite wikipedias policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister. i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style organization and applicability be inline with one or more regulatory bodies?now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases do you have access to them elsevier jstor edas ieee springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them youre stuck in a google funk but i digress are full of references to fourth factor. that cash register key the manager uses when you return something yep someone you know. an thats been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful. i just didnt realize you alone set these standards. i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly. ,0

1517,1517,tangential forces the tangential forces coriolis and euler can be applied to a system but they dont occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism but that is off topic.during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two.we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like. the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained corotating radial motion.in a rotating frame of reference with nonuniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially.in a keplerian orbit there will be zero tangential acceleration although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force.having said all this tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. the centrifugal force is an outward radial force.more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the radial distance variable.they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.,0

1519,1519,yes youre right theologically catholicism is very different to american protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want. sure they use the teleological argument but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isnt pseudoscience which is what irks me as a scientist. but i dont understand theology probably because ive been trained to think too scientifically. and the catholic church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues. but catholics are really into authority so what the hierarchy says goes. — dunc☺,0

1566,1566,a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies phylogenies i.e. dictomously branching processes are processes that involve things that is objects and as such have to be modeled by objectoriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria. now as an objectoriented model the model actually represents two consecutive objects i.e. two objects in a row by each of its internal lines i.e. lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node the former belonging to the category i.e. concept objects after nodes and the latter to the category objects before nodes. if the model includes all objects of a certain category then both of these make up this category. in summary phylogenies consist of two categories i.e. concepts of objects objects before nodes and objects after nodes and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category then these two categories make up this category.cladistics or cladism as i prefer to call it confuses the concept objects after nodes with the concept objects before nodes by defining lines between nodes as single things thereby confusing category with object that is kind with thing thus confusing conceptualization itself. the approach is actually a return to a prescientific stage this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. if this approach could ever be proved to be correct then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. luckily einsteins discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach i.e. claim and this it did even before the approach was born. cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged. consist presently at ... ,0
1567,1567,hi how are you today? ive been looking over your fetal alcohol work and its pretty sharp. my dads a doc and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that he looked at it too. good work.so yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy. im not looking to out anyone or anyhting its just gotten to the point that well i think theres a reason and other people too to read about this fascinating community activist. i was telling will beback ive been a memebr of sierra club since i was akid my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life and ive done the same wiht my own children. its a cool way to move things forward like that movie but hoefulyl much less trite. anyhow.. whats the good word with you today? i think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog punching in before they set out to undermine one another. because thats whats happening here im actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. look over at biff rose there was a flargrant violation of the rr standard and i pointed out that to will beback that each time i made that violation i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know ive got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip to follow up on as i told will you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you cant just block an article because true information is being disseminated through it. well you can but its against the wiki rules and so you are in violation though i dont really think you care anyhow hope you keep your head above water and il lsee you at the fights so to speak. have a good day ill remain civil as long as you do.. but you ve got to remain civil in your actions too ok? ok.,0
1568,1568,your source states about the black–white difference in iq which at the time was about points the neisser et al. article stated there is not much direct evidence on this point but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis. that conclusion stands today there has been no new direct evidence on the question. see rushton jensen a b gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black–white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.please stop lying. ... then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no. do you see the problem here? ... question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view? the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars. yes. ... question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist? the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology. the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article. no. nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having virtually no chance of being true by a reliable tertiary source. ... ,0

1638,1638,untitledalso see infobox vote codes and minor state please stop since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there. is algeria minor? iran? its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted. as for making ma a country code for western sahara its not. ma is a code for morocco and so it is in moroccos infobox. eh was created for western sahara so that is its country code. as far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the united nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places. ❤t☮c☺m☯ it does not need a definition to be in the article. a minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council ... etc. as to the eh domain it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for ws but it is not assigned .ma being the one used in the territory. the same thing applies for the currency the mad is the currency of morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. the same thing goes for the iac the time zone + utc etc. they are the ones used in the territory. these things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. as to your ridiculous claim of the un considering the territory as occupied i already explained to you the difference between a un position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in of the algeriancuban drafted document that has no obligation on the un. the zionism=racism example is the brightest one for you to understand it. i will revert to the version that was in use before the anon ip started this mess. it does since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense. what states that .ma is being used in the territory? do you have any evidence of this at all? the same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. to ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards. western sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states im not going through this with you again. ❤t☮c☺m☯ ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. minor states is indeed a value judgement although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena algeria is not a big newsmaker per se. but in the interest of neutrality merely noting african asian and latin american states seems reasonable. at the same time if koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. same standards on language. evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in western sahara provinces using .ma. it is trivially easy to find that. koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding. what is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in western sahara? « d. trebbien talk may utc good question. since effectively all internet service to the western sahara is via maroc telecom or other moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in moroccan territory exws provinces largely in the casarabat area. technically i am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service. presumably the regional investment office of laayoune may have its server physically in laayoune. other similar offices may also. it strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the moroccan address .ma. polisario partisans may not like that but its effective reality. country codes i find it reasonable th,0

1651,1651,sock puppetry? is using any account whatsoever considered sock puppetry? this site is a complete joke. i cant even edit using a verifiable account without being accused of violating some concocted offense. my address was censored because i was using an account which was apparently improperly named so i am now using one that is properly named after the probation period and that in and of itself is apparently an offense. logically what is going on is that i am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because i am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance. what kind of site are you people trying to run here? its no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when its become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. i have continuously been censored for editing a biased article an article which is continuously edited by selfavowed marxists and antizionists the very same people whose pov the article unashamedly puts forward. what kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? if any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication but its quite apparent that wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. there is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. in short explain yourselves particularly roland rance who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with all without explaining why. when you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility. as it stands wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence.,0

1677,1677,mario party is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for nintendo platforms featuring popular nintendo characters. it was released on the nintendo gamecube in north america on october strangely before the japanese release on november . it was released on november in europe being heavily criticised for being nintendos big gamecube game for christmas as metroid prime was delayed until march .mario party was the first mario party that was released on the nintendo gamecube. each board had its own host including toad goomba shy guy koopa and boo. mario party also contains some characters new to the franchise thwomp and whomp. klepto dolphin lakitu and star along with two completely new characters named genie of the lamp and ztar are included as well. mario party retains the story mode found in mario party .the game as usual contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board trying to collect as many stars as possible. the star space would appear randomly on the board and players would have to reach it before anyone else. however the stars carry a price tag of coins and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames which take place at the end of each turn after all the players have rolled the dice block which will always roll a number from one to ten.battle minigames are like the player games but generally with many exceptions a little more elaborate. battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins from into a pot. first place gets % of the pot second place gets % and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. every mario party contains to minigames of a few different types. fourplayer games are a freeforall in which all players compete against each other. on and on minigames put players in groups so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win even though they are against each other in the main game. in most situations winners of these games make coins each.a new addition to the mario party series was the bowser minigames. players play in a very elaborate minigame that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. see bowser minigame section below the loser loses a prespecified item usually coins or items.gameplayboards toads midway madness goombas greedy gala koopas seaside soiree shy guys jungle jam boos haunted bash bowsers gnarly party clear story mode to unlock itspacesthere is various spaces you can land in the game. the following is a list of them and what they do.blue space you get three coins. also there is a special feature on this game called hidden blocks in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.red space you lose three coins.green happening space a special board event takes place.warp space you are sent to the same space as an opponent. a spinner chooses which opponents space you will warp to.mushroom space two boxes will appear one big and one small. choose one and you will be given either a mini mushroom or a mega mushroom. note the mega mushroom is not always in the large box and the mini mushroom is not always in the small box.battle space a battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. the better you finish in the minigame the more coins you will get back from the pot.bowser space bowser may steal items from players or a bowser minigame may begin.fortune space a reversal of fortune begins in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. the player who landed,0

1695,1695, hie dvdm. i was writing what follows while you made your edit. i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example.thanks johnuniq for your advice and input. concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s early s. adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats. but thats not the really important issue here. the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there. btw in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out. at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved. there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for. cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place. throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute. so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length. ,0

1709,1709,the particular section lists what has been claimed in rebuttal to the code theft charge. that the claims regarding the significance of c to c++ translation and bit conversion seem spurious false or dubious to c/c++ programmers are acknowledged. that the medievia web page makes blatantly false statements about dates the origination of other muds and the significance of the above i also acknowledge. i dont believe the article section is about uncovering the truth of their claims. the only fact necessary to presenting that viewpoint is that theyve claimed it. also presenting a lengthy history of public proclamations and announcements by the games principals which contradict their own official web history page is beyond the scope i think of what most people care about.,0

1714,1714,arji what makes you think this assertion is mistaken? it is not my assertion it is the conclusion of this agencies report taken to be reputable enough to be run by several respectable news carriers around the world. naming me a troll is a classy touch and calling for all dialogue with me to cease should be grounds for your indef banning from wikipedia.the fact that you and kim dont believe the conclusions does not matter the evidence passes wpv and wprs. the evidence has been released to the media and noone of repute thats not you kim btw has challenged the validity or accuracy of the study. the fact that the study doesnt include chinas massive underground coal mine fires only helps the conclusions of the report.,0
1715,1715,firstly some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts? also the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said. perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant. perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily. i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia but i also exploited loop holes in the rules. so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning. and im so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page. you asked that we do something i.e. explain the significance of the clan etc and we did but you deleted it anyway. and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us. also one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that? if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth? also if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right? if you say no then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit. before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. ,0

1720,1720,elellandhello humusi am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot. i m very inexperienced with wikipedia. i was enthralled by wikipedia. initially. that is until i met eleland. i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland. eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted. he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.the article was on ed oloughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent. the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. he was amongst the candidates for this years dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.so i studied eleland a little.ive looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict. more than were directly antiisrael. his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the proisrael side. in this way he has undermined many many articles.personally i dont care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc. i think there is a problem.wikipedia is i am afraid beginning to read like eleland wrote the script.who is eleland? what power does he actually have?can anything be done?adon emmetif you post a reply here i will contact here or even by email,0

1756,1756, misleading reference to study? in the section on lead paint in art which i largely wrote someone added the followinglead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids often from fingerprints. as a result many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited. their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that wasnt absolutely clear. but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle dont usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections. and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artists paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead. normally flake white is used only by oil painters and theres no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. cooperstown is a wellrespected institution but as of now im sticking with the classic ralph mayer. flake white may get slightly yellowish after centuries but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. if someone has more information on this please mention it here otherwise when i come back im going to delete that paragraph or water it down no pun intended.,0
1757,1757,thats my point. i looked for false positives or any feature that would distinguish these accounts and there was none to be found. the unpleasant situation is that we had a user with a history of exactly this sort of problem with a set of circumstances reported by users in good standing that exactly matched sock puppetry. i had to make a difficult judgment call per all the available information and the conclusion was a finding of sock puppetry. i have invited checkusers and others to review the report. everything is available for inspection and comment. talk,0
1758,1758,did you even look at my edit before reverting it? i did change it up as you wanted to say that rex thinks it doesnt work. and as you said it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article making it perfect for the lead. just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesnt mean we can also use this source. the more sources the better. i would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldnt be added. as i know all too well how this works no one touches it in order to finish this dispute and then the person who didnt want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won. and then revert whenever the page gets changed.,0

1765,1765,there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white. users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view cited sources or not its obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong. i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what .% of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this .% obviously not including alun slrubenstein. when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another. all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke. you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist. so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a white person is just do us all a favor and either delete this article since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you get over it and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesnt scientifically exist. /end commafest ,0

1769,1769,ive traced the origin of one of the disputed sentences myself. it seems the problem stems from multiple users whose first language is not english who dont understand the need for sources and who cant edit in accordance with wpnpov. at july adds ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out the problem of french language. pov poor english unsourced and meaningless whats the problem with the french language that causes problems for mathematicians? some of the worlds best mathematicians are french.at august who seems to be french changes it to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity. pov poor english unencyclopedic insulting unsourced.at august changes it to ishihara then apologized by stating his apreciation for the french culture. unsourced and contains a spelling mistake possibly just a typo.at august userhmib reverts to ishihara stated he respects the french culture but he just pointed out his ignorance about french mathematicians and his stupidity. see above.perhaps the dispute between foc and hmib could be reduced if you were both to supply sources for every edit thats likely to be challenged. also please bear in mind that this is the english wikipedia and edits must conform to a minimal standard of english. this is especially true when the edits are contentious and are leading to weekslong edit wars. im leaving this on focs page too. talk august utc,0
1770,1770,addressingwhile indian tribe is official us govt lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur dalene people once inhabited acres ha in northern idaho and washington and montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur dalene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties idaho. you dont have to use my wording but you see how i am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined. .  boomer second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. id put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway? keep the chronology clearer. interesting that the coeur dalene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm from a very cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter. the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case.,0

1776,1776, pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offlinehiim not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous.does this mean i hadnt registered? i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have. i always use my real name in signatures.and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link.thanksdennis bathorykitszbathorybathorythanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear. whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name. i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w. bush at least if its not already taken. wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently. all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself. thats what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym. it is not independently verified against some external identity database. and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia. we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials.by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathorykitzs. that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system. such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you. that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia. when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit. users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia. but those are all manual checks. there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.likewise no one can inherently trust the email address. the way internet domains are set up anyone could register and create any email name they wanted. like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority. and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.most people are honest. but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not. thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security. the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours. how can a bank know that youre really you? and how far can that trust be extended? under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable? how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible. unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate. anyway ill get off my soapbox now. thanks for your message.to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia. the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top. that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols. you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages. you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes . when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp.again welcome to wikipedia. talk ,0

1787,1787,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory. it cant because langan is not a member of academia. but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable. for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions.byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. this is correct. to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions. however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral. unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal. he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself. by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu. this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well. oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously. ,0

1794,1794, september utcill try to take the points in turn. hope i get this format right. wpblpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. i am not sure how the section applies if you could be more clear it would be helpful. the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. by this metric so little can be used that its almost meaningless. someone stating their birthdate or the grade school they attended. but for a person saying i have a conflict with jenny smith over issue x where do we draw the line? it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing with one placing on their personal publicist website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldnt argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. one can take things too far and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. ... ,0

1815,1815,whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation. in this case organic remains was added to explain the word they. while w used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils. from the dictionary of geologic terms rd edition by bates and johnson fossil any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time. nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time. and further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.w likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this wp page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future. it is unfortunate that w were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as misunderstand and twist what they said.as much impact as w have had on creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood is now way out of date. modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood. when critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism. ,0

1818,1818, question sarah there is something that ive wondered about for a long time that is related to coi editing. one need look no further than my user page where i quote chris hedges they control our systems of information. and add surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporateapproved encyclopedia. at a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easilyled lamebrained losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy. what if anything is presently being done? im aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to prove that he had no coi related to the articles he edits and ive heard of this incident dozens of times since where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest. many times ive wondered how wikipedia went about finding this socalled proof. if i put myself in a position in which i was editing for pay but denied it how could it be proven that i was? i mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have wp give him/her the wp stamp of approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please. they can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check. ,0

1893,1893,this entry was deleted by its author owing to the fact that it contains research which is being distorted somewhat. since its a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist ive decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic. thus the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations distortions etc is to remove it. since you have decided to continue this antagonization i am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at wikipedia. of course you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the havana shipyards however ive decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article. use of any of the above by persons other than the author without his permission is in violation of international copyright standards and will be promplty reported to the fcc federal communications commission and all other pertinent authorities.,0
1894,1894, remeetup thread well coi can be a pretty harsh word on wikipedia and your misconception of david shankbone as a real name probably sounded more like bitter irony. and sometimes people tend to get hotter in conversation than they intend. online communication can be difficult and there is a reason why human beings have faces. ,0

1900,1900,i think that the infobox should at least have a picture of muhammad if there is to be one anywhere. the image for the page on muhammad should be a depiction of muhammad. having calligraphy or symbolism replace an actual picture would not be in the spirit of wikipedia. regrettably it will offend some people but that is not nor should be the impetus behind any decision. a picture of muhammad would be more encyclopedic and offer more knowledge therefore it is the only real option if this is to remain a truly neutral place to obtain knowledge. also i feel like there is an overabundance of images in this article. lots of images of redundant or mildly irrelevant things as if people are unconsciously putting in different images because they feel bad about putting in an image of muhammad.,0

1914,1914, colorado balloon incident greetings. i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon. unfortunately wikipedias use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts. its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia. refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article. wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents. the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. ive been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.i hope i havent given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as i do especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. thanks for your contributions ,0
1915,1915, this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x for the following reasons. should sort amd or intel implementations as x? generally x was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa might or might name themselves with such as cyrix x intel pentium and so on. amds long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together. nowadays software labeled themselves as x are ia compatible software and use x or x differentiating with it. so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. . generations? what is the th generation x processor? who invented this kinda processors? amd k just says that it succeeds amd k rather than saying it is the th x processor and ive never heard intel call their x processors exceeding the th generation. and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the th x processor succeeding pentium iii but none confirmed this. so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and efficeon if the morph firmed on the system board implements x decoder call themselves as x processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor? at this situation what kind of processor is it? ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the th/th generation x? who is another jane austen making up another northanger abbey?. x is one architectureisa name? what such a ridiculous thing that ive ever heard on earth x is used to referring the processor a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. if it were the name of an architecture then in this logic way intel is one of the implementation of this architecture? ,0
1916,1916,amcom article hiearlier today i noticed that there is no article on amcom and i posted on the amnet talk page before moving it to talkamcom because although the network is called amnet the actual company is called amcom.i didnt realize until later that there was already an amcom actually amnet page that had been deleted. after reading the explanation for the deletion im not sure whether amcom really has enough notability or not. however if we do want to make an amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the companys notability.if you are still interested take a look at this article i found if you want to reply to me make sure you either reply on my talk page or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. otherwise i wont know that youve replied.welcome and good luck,0

2029,2029,undent this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. see archive . the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign . hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. the relationship if one can call it that between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright. many elections nowadays feature guiltbyassociation games but obamawrighttucc is a bit different because the coverage went on so long during the campaign and the relationship went on so long in real life. if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article. there are hundreds of other items in the subarticles also. picking out just hagee to add to this main article and not picking out those other hundreds of items would cause undue weight. this article is about mccains whole life not just the current campaign and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant. if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election then the person can go to the article about mccains campaign which has a couple paragraphs about hagee. in writing this article dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are and those that arent quite as important dont make the cut. right now some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shootdown or more on mccainfeingold or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s as compared to more about hagee.,0

2035,2035,alex thank you for your reply.i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion.regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat. that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later. there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page.the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland. it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion. and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine. note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep. i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system. 連絡 見学/迷惑 ,0
2036,2036,i found a better reference.in page theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women. of these only the first is common.and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous and per cent for monogamous unions.the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either. this had been sitting on the shelf for over years deep in the recesses of the basement. murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.,0

2086,2086,further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede . since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article which should be sourced wpcitelead does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. the first two sections of the article detail transcripts in which hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards. sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. tags only alert editors to a potential problem but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it. ,0

2107,2107,kenneth tennysons reckless behavior in other forums==as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors here is an exerpt from a book review on founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement never studied under a legitimate teacher or any martial art teacher never set foot in asia completely disproven shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson et al. was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and ill enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what exstudents say at him a propaganda liemaster. the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsportwhile putting others down kenny brags or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare peoplehmmm... well kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera alot of jumping and posturing and a lot of religious themes to it. i guess it depends on what martial arts youve trained in to determine whether i can kick a$$ or not. lets see... im a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. ive got to start learning about grappling though. freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist. here are some excerpts from users from other forumsthe armchair analyst asia times forumi see. however you sounded like a racist.no i have no south asian sensitivities. i am no nationalist/jingoist. i consider myself above it all. all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness. it may be in a narrow anglosaxon way but not in a gandhibuddha sort of a way. get it?civilizations such as india actually even china until today have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.you have generalized indians to be bigots etc. i agree that some not all are. but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist. yes it does rocky asia times forumwhat inaccuracy are you referring to? if brits came to india and got rich was the wealth indian or british? besides looting what exactly did british accomplish? while your bias is clearly visible with this statement what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?isnt it quiet evident that even in yr it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass why on earth would anything written by anglosaxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? thats just a couple of the many others. however i do not want to clog up this page.i have also noticed that kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites i know that i am not the only one who knows thisbrahman martial arts planet forumi really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning. bliss asia times forumthats not from a social studies journal you fraud thats a copy paste... rocky asia times forumi believe kenneth probably picked up a website of some tourist board,0

2111,2111,hmmm. i was actually writing a response as you sent yours. oh well. for the record my response was thisresurrecting articles is frowned upon yes. we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change to...the game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article.making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders. certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start. i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article i.e. not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works. if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan. i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same. i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though. the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as – manchester city f.c. season/spurs city or however the subpage is actually named given the / in the name.yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category. i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic. better to do it ourselves i guess.sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and...well better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed. hopefully i addressed all your points. ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak. having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in. generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy. yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play. to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup? in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it. talk ,0

2139,2139, july utcalthough i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine. i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so. not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles. nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles. however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now. at some point however i will source his/her statements as soon as i find time to delve into the texts just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you. until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this. the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth. but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail. from wikipedia re. abbey road being the final album or notabbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles. although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded. ...after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days. .. just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album. martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be. in their interviews for the beatles anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note.re. the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road but it is followed by her majesty. in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on july her majesty followed mean mr. mustard......etc. this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people. ,0

2148,2148,at bat edit warring at matt joyce baseball juan encarnación terry tiffee ian kinsler craig breslow matt guerrier etc.==please dont change at bat to atbat. atbat just redirects right back to at bat anyway. i agree. i agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated. in addition pls stop edit warring at matt joyce baseball ian kinsler craig breslow etc. and add to the list matt guerrier. it is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record. there is no reason to delete it other than your penchant for disruptive edits. kindly desist. it has also been explained to you with proper citations that the plural of rbi is rbis. pls stop edit warring this point. see juan encarnación and terry tiffee. that is vandalism. run batted in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis. obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info.its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  t / c danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap. both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler either make it a subhed or take it off seriously.oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky. in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in. rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint.either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. jackal again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch. as to rbis as xlee pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseball/archiverbis. plus is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention. yet jackals reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s as though the s is incorrect. he has done the same with at bat which he insists must be hyphenated. etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits. it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits. if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits. there is enough good work he could perform instead. well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do . as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one. regarding what uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue. in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists. allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked. jargon overrides grammar. to say that a batter flied out is probably not good grammar either but its proper baseball terminology. i think this needs to be discussed at the project page assuming anyones watching that page anymore. userbaseball,0

2152,2152, legislation european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. the source reads the european union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide. some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. lets have a look at the law itself. framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia official press release certain forms of conduct as outlined below which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences ... public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group. in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case. whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal. as we see the law is restricted to cases when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredis the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court? ,0

2234,2234,matia i have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do not have the word language in the title. witness brigish english mandarin linguistics flemish linguistics ashkenazi hebrew cantonese linguistics american english sephardi hebrew etc etc... arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by wikipedia policy therefore arvanitic language or arvanitika language are out of the question. i dont want to use arvanitika albanian as it will be too controversial so i dont want albanian in the title. therefore the only options are arvanitic or arvanitika. they can and should be used. arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used. what is wrong with it? it is neutral. it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica etc aree wrong. macedonian and luxembourgish etc can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect. if britannica or unesco etc said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such. no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. why should they be treated as such. every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title. arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies. what unesco britannica etc say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor. i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will. are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english? no so stop that straw man argument. arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone and has majority support here and will be used according to policy. the world is not made to please you neither is wikipedia. we have policies that must be observed so if you want to use wikipedia you will just have to accept them. regards ps does peace mean having to violate wp policies? that is what you are asking me to do,0

2298,2298, utcas a close follower of the languagepolitical issues in finland i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongues significance in defining what if you will we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnishspeakers. swedishspeakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual peoples mothertongue point of view is patent nonsense the mother tongue of say my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. whatever happens in the future our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population and this must be taken into account here. i can well understand how fennoswedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin. august ,0

2329,2329,hello deacon thanks for the kind words. your wording is better regarding territory but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar? but theres no great preference here either way.oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of ionabased clerics in northumbrian territory quite noticeable by pehthelms consecration in the th century ... have a look at the skene reference i cite which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way.it looks like a political process constant and steady but not a sudden forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony. northumbrias fortunes were upanddown in the th century regarding its southern neighbors particularly mercia and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones. im aware of the substantial history of ionabased clerics in bernicia but times change and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons.the translation of pehthelms name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flatout so have a look at the reference cited i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article. regards ,0

2332,2332,troublesome sentencepaleolithic europeans seem to have been a homogenous population possibly due to a population bottleneck or nearextinction event on the iberian peninsula where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation and then expanded into europe during the mesolithic periodthis is false. i cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that palaeolithic europe was genetically homogeneous. if there is one it would require inline citation. i think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. the studies have rather shown that mesolithic europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. the bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.,0

2376,2376, im not even sure what you mean when you stated just trying to help make you piece sound better. do you mean your piece? if so this isnt my piece. its an article written from the contribution of many editors. i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify. secondly you didnt just change a phrase. you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting. if you read the entire sentence its somewhat redundant to add that. and finally theres nothing unprofessional about the term railroad. in fact its actually a better fit. if you look up the definition for railway youll find that its often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances. we have no idea if thats true or not and therefore railroad is actually preferred. ,0

2394,2394, european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not .as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version. now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable. i contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she thinks it is the most neutral one. i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the eu. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included. i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages. ,0

2402,2402,a poor start sorry. the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. first of all no common twonations table is possible patent nonsense. second i object the followingthe passage from the russian table speaking of the kievan rus. as someone suggested earlier that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between kievan rus and modern russia. this is the main disputed claim commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian usersregardless of any ukrainian military table none of them may include the red army. this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states with very formal postwwii exception but also significantly antiukrainian. for instance red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and antisoviet guerillas. creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users. for instance see earlier alexpus passage on trading the truthgiven all that id suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising. i thank you an innocent editor for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue. ,0
2403,2403,an admittedly biased source but with more or less first hand information is the chabad group which just smuggled or at least claims to have matzoh from the ukraine to iran for the passover holiday. the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jews in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover according to tradition.some jews currently live in iran. the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion but forbid the import of israelmade products to the country an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years. while they probably didnt get an exact census of the people they were delivering to id guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. so seems to be the way to go. ,0

2420,2420, more description of location please? hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is? i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful. i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. what do you think? any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful. i may be being unusually thick happens all the time actually but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you. thanks and best wishes ,0

2436,2436,changes to this page open discussion ==since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a démenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris. i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors. i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page. i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there. this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved.the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page. the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window. the same for paris history or paris fashion. here i am but repeating what i have already written below.in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages. my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own. this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity. my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris history has a page of its own. just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have. with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt. in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary. please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all. addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here > please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out== ,0

2451,2451,official christian death ® this page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish which simply need changing and then leaving alone.i have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which i wish to place on here knowing full well that minutes later the fools that wish to write things they know little about or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become cd will desperately alter the content. the article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts. people that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them. but the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow. rd party discussion regarding valor or rozz should be eliminated in favour of the christian death biography.message me at to have discussion about page.article i propose is thus text only i will alter the page to format correctly and alter the main page add feedback to this after my discussion in thread called editing talkchristian death® comment not inside this.christian deathbiographydiscography in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth. then christian death turned it upside down.historyofficially there have been over musicians involved with the band. therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.formed in los angeles and fronted by year old vocalist/lyricist rozz williams the band released the first album “only theatre of pain in . a dark sinister style of punk rock. the album gained local success. a year later the band completely broke upsinger rozz then joined the band “pompeii founded by singer guitarist song writer valor.rozz took over vocals leaving valor to focus on guitar. before rozz joined pompeii the band had already released their fist album “look at yourself” to much acclaim which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. the pompeii had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their french record company to merge pompeii into a new version of christian death which after some debate was agreed upon. thus began the new christian death and the first pompeii tour became the first christian death tour.part way through the tour the band stopped in wales to record songs some of which were originally intended for the next pompeii album. the fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “catastrophe ballet”.like the first pompeii album catastrophe ballet had an apocalyptic theme however the music morphed into something not quite pompeii and nothing like the first christian death album. after the tour the band returned to la to later record the rd christian death album”ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. after confirming the nd tour in singer rozz quit the band. valor returned to vocals the band embarked on the nd tour. in italy the band recorded the mini album “the wind kissed pictures” a surrealist view of a mystical past. almost immediately work began on the th full length album “atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of world war ii and the connection to future shock waves. while continuously touring in the band released the th and now classic album “the scriptures” the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today. brought us the release of “sex drugs jesus christ”. this was turning point for the band. the cover depicted an image of jesus shooting up heroin. this was a full frontal attack by valor against the church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized christianity. the band then found themselves confronted by protesters riots and bomb threats these events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of nine inch nails korn marilyn manson type o negative every goth band on the planet and many others. saw the release of the double album epic “all the love all the hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death day and night man and woman black and white.in came the release of “insanus ultio proditio misericordiaque” with its theme of an ancient dream state.late in after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting christian death rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in los angels under the name christian death. on the same day christian death was in europe performing in paris france. assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash as explained to valor,0

2470,2470,the very long discussion over st wpscn project talk page i have read a lot of the wpscn pages and the very few have neutrality tags. some have or tags but the majority seem to be npov. so why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three scientologists from what i can make out have scanned all three user pages and a lot of comments are unsigned about how the project is biased against elron? would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging npov possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out nonnpov statements on the talk pages of those articles? after all xenu is fa status so the npov cannot be too far off. as for unsigned the comment you left after my first post was unsigned and there were a couple of more during the discussion.,0

2478,2478,nor have i made a legal threat. first i am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the blm protest. i have never known any of these people. i would not be the offended party in any case. ive never even lived in minnesota or been there in over years or so. i made an airplane connection through minneapolis in about as i vaguely recall. i am not saying there will be any sort of legal proceeding i am merely saying that to cite this claim heard the nword risks running afoul of being libel. i think wp rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody heard the nword is problematic from a wpblp standpoint. if multiple blm protestors claim that they heard one of the white visitors say the nword and it was cited from some reliable source that would probably change my opinion. can you see why this would be a different situation? ,0

2482,2482,im in twothree minds over this proposal. as regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic ive seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a wprs is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards. on the third hand we do get some nohopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as nonnotable. in the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking thats why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as i can tell. andemu ,0

2492,2492,parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know betterdear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing. she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it. i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section. she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike. not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you.to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in. then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version. is that soapboxing??to use another example closer to home. lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail? like he clearly said here under the desperate? heading heeeeelp. and then he also bizarrely? asks gregalton help him delete references to like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism? can you believe it? i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this. the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll. he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. it made me realize that were going around in circles. we improve the articles to the point that they look great. then they get screwed up again. so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery? it could help people who arent educated...the idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his. the guy is mad. if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation. then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing. zenwhat is clearly a piece of work. check out the dudes talk page. in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana. so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking. what a comboseeing this i ponder my options. i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better? versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions. for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the eight? people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page. it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing. is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines? this is like watching evolution in reverse. i carefully construct a page with the help of others. it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos?. instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0

2517,2517,verbal your pov is showing. i didnt choose the closing admin there was a neutral notice at wpan and jzg while he made a comment in the discussion wasnt involved any longer. it was not his action being reversed effectively but s and he had already recused himself. so lets find out what the actual consensus is if someone else doesnt beat me to it instead of blabbering more. ill be adding an external link and well see what happens. note that we already have an external link to lenr in martin fleischmann and that was heavily reviewed. we should have many more here as convenience links if nothing else. same wiht net.,0

2528,2528,frankly this is a waste of everybodys time. it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again full in the knowledge that you will not accept them. your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole. you have consistently failed to assume good faith and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article. you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was. yet you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy. we havent moved on significantly.if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us. wpucs is a guide an essay not policy. in any case common sense dictates that on controversial articles material is more likely to be challenged than on noncontroversial ones. this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us. the material has implications for npov. these are the facts that are relevant here. a long circular argument on talk helps noone. talk ,0

2561,2561,just to make the point that im not making this problem up heres the abstract of who are the canadians? changing census responses canadian ethnic studies journal spring by monica boyd doug norris at the close of the twentieth century canadian has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group up from . percent in to nearly percent in and to percent in the census of canada. from what groups did this indigenous label draw in the five years between the and the censuses? using unpublished tabulations from the and canadian censuses this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the canadianborn age in and age by . we find that most of the increases between and in canadian ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in british origin responses. between and increasing canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the british and french ethnic origin counts. in some provinces notably the prairie provinces of alberta manitoba and saskatchewan shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups. ,0

2573,2573, talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you. peter iii of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin? your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. the reasons to prefer the coin areit is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w/ a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese kingin your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. srnec the problem is that we have different criteria.you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information.i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. the two representations have the same chance of not being % accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other.if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing. but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time. i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary. do you have an argument? why are your criteria better than mine? really? when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons. but i do not want another long discussion with you. i offer consensus. would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? both of those are improvements over the thcentury image but not over the coin. at least one other editor agrees with me. sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. this discussion is already too long. both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life. either both seem right. imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. you are not allowed to impose your will. both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles. they were reviewed by several editors. stop with your edit warring. lecen is aware of the threerevert rule. are you? youve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours. you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.,0

2576,2576,regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada my reading of his csr transcript is exactly the opposite. he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five stolen? canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan.regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to khaldan for years? i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team. but if the camp had been a college i think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer. a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted. az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training. and once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones. he had helped grads slip into bosnia during the civil war there. i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp. his location was a secret for four years. he was found in a libyan prinson in april by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him. and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide. i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version his pretorture versions of what the camp did.,0
2577,2577,as i suspected complete nonsense. your statement is so silly that i cant begin to tell you how wrong it is. you said you there presume that your notyetfiled arbcom case has been decided. i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption. i am not a stupid person. i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick.you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability commentby the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack.heres a few points for you to think on.wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.then lets consider the arbcom an article. what then is this articles content?hmm lets see the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of? why members. so that means the content of the committee is its members. so an election is a decision on the content of this article.so.members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.you dont like that?wpcivil wpagf wpnpa are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.but arbcom is not an article. it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions.is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership? if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid? would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder? if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing? can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? the questions were politely put. they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom. they were not deferential. which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully. do not try to bully me.finally i would contrast the participation of admins in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here. ,0

2694,2694,for daniel casehi daniel. the block is extremely odd. imo there is no real discussion of my activity in that an thread in connection with a siteban. jehochman whom i have some history with floated the idea of a siteban. durova who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of cirt generally badmouths me about abusive sockpuppetry etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by ryulong. i agree to it. then ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. blueboy a new admin that improperly blocked me an established editor as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom i blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. he is supported by guess who jehochman durova and athaenara whom i also have history with and whose wprfa i made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. i can provide diffs for all of this but i want to show you one thread now over at wikinews. durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin luckily takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom here. i invite a neutral admin to do the same here. i have to run now. please let me know how you would like to proceed. thanks.,0

2705,2705, i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree but the term refers to divisions in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world. you still prefer previous title i.e. united nations statistical divisions to the current one i.e. united nations geoscheme?if so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics divisioncapitalized singular form in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at the term statistical divisionsplural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones. google this statistical divisions site the term statistical divisionsplural form can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments. google this statistical divisions sitetherefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m. . un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical. i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping. natural earth has regionun and subregion metadata for each country. i use it quiet often. it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as un geoscheme. try google book search and you will find at least the followingthe best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations un geoscheme for asia. as per this asia is subdivided to four broad categories....the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states conversely the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region ....country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification....were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme /unsd/methods/m/... that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme. in fact ...i also agree that many un agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc. have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research. this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better. although it is not official term or a technical term un m. i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. correct me if i am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m. . moving forwards since dont have the time nor will to take it to rm and if you do not have any further couterevidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm. of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented and new evidence/citations here before i bring it to rm. comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ,0

2717,2717, redennis browns final warning i didnt mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. i didnt violate the final warning curtisnaito did multiple times. the exact wording of the warning was if either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility bludgeons a discussion violates wpidht acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of hours. at no point did i push the boundaries of civility bludgeon a discussion violate idht act in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. curtisnaito displayed the exact same kind of idht behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions and when told explicitly that he was violating dennis browns final warning he kept doing it.your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual when nothing i had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning was an offtopic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.i understand you dont like me but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly? 聖やや ,0

2759,2759,fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in . by the name fc citizens vardar the club won championships from till . about yugoslavia you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics countries together and each republic had its own championship and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together. each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation and its was called the cup of the marshal. how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams thats why its called the federal league and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup. the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents. the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed serbia monte negromacedonia and two provinces almost the same as republics but yet without a nation those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics croatia bosnia and slovenia sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions . in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes those provinces were skopje bitolashtip and vranje prvinces. these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships. in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for the ww the championship was held under german occupation and the german government recognized this league. after the ww the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia transformed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in . the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s macedonian republic league was transformed in to macedonian first league. so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this level. its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side. serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues. they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league. they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition. for fc vardar at this point of view considering that macedonia is not in the federetion for more than yearsand it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation the period before you should write the precise information. second federal league east is the name of the competition and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to itinstead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship.,0

2771,2771,hello barto. i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it? as stated on the talk page there you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left. these are terms both i and ron himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights. i could explain why here but i wont bore you with the details.however i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article. i am editing at another page where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. i will not object to socalled left or right sources as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr. gostick. the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him league objectives and views or anyone associated with him. this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridges document hardly a nonpolitcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for.i will try to help you find sources fair and credible in the near future doing edits myself. i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him. i know well what he and the league of rights stand for as i have been involved with it for near yrs. there is no denying he was antitotalitarianism and that includes antizionist which automatically brings down the bogus smear of antisemitism and other such nonsense. an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gosticks page in case he didnt know it existed. be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later. one was a recent highlevel member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it. living or dead i dont care to see this happen to anyone. feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish. do you have a wiki email or a private one? ,0

2804,2804,hey. it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner. you have to change this attitude on your part. your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus even if it is demonstrably wrong in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. you guys are of course wrong. you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine. your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia. i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason. it is just plain innacurate....,0

2819,2819,first if you create obviously bogus claims nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste. one refutation is more than sufficient. second your rationales appear to be shifting. originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements. now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable. be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy. given your contentious history with this article dating back over a year it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source. i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy. consequently if you want to be taken seriously you need act cooperatively to resolve issues. this means being specific in your complaints citing the exact policy. this means no specious claims. and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you dont have any specific issues. can you abide by these conditions? ,0

2832,2832,deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists. so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert/yorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environmentfrom a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two. if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy ? this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.this scenario is dennetts and to some extent everetts. since the question doesnt even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. you might conclude that this question doesnt make any sense. but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not. in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy .to give an example of actual or and synth ill go beyond dennetts example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective. for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later. what is the subjective experience? from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? boltzmanns brain is a similar idea. ,0

2855,2855,yes you got it the govt lied. see the talk page for cselr ok im lazy and not typing current page name. they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from. i have provided the link to the index of papers produced mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw so you can confirm that the business case was never provided. there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary. some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and posttfnsw publications such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are % lower.. i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about. that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language. the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions. the terms of reference open to the public to see for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this. i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past selfproclaimed senior executive of tfnsw. so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group. = link to index of docs produced for st call that is why there was the nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at. by making the nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the st call they made it public. the outcome they expected was what ended up happening.,0

2862,2862,i agree. i certainly agree that the last paragraphs should be removed as ive argued above. im agnostic on the rest but agree that a full rewrite should be undertaken by a knowledgable editor.,0
2863,2863,i disagree. the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy parliamentary system that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. that hasnt changed and so to say that because we currently have a coalition of whatever party means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime ministers secondincommand and if cameron were to die/resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister i would completely agree that he should be there but it isnt. clegg may be deputy prime minister but he is not deputy head of government and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.,0

2870,2870,getting what specifically? so far busby has been right about most things. his detractors are from the nuclear industry. he is a recognised expert and not as far to the extreme as you claim wphonesty wpnotscandal. i am dismayed why you continue to attack this man especially when your identity is known this leaves you wide open for proceedings as busby has apparently started to do. nuclear and its radiological effect are now understood busby has significantly contributed to internal emitter debate this the central argument of second event theory. modern research has now accepted this damaging form of exposure as it was previously ignored. you could say in fact that busby was ahead of his time and received much criticism for it. ,0

2872,2872, thank you for pointing out that anne of świdnica wikipedia wiki has only hits not as many web pages mirror wikipedia content and not all pages acknowledge that. allowing the further propagation of such or terms is clearly unacceptable.when looking at google scholar anne of swidnica has at least one hit compared to none for the diacritic version or the polish name and that refers to the book medieval germany an encyclopedia already mentioned above which on page uses inconsistent naming by two different authors while elsewhere preferring schweidnitz. google scholar with hits for anna von schweidnitz shows that this is the proper name used internationally by scholars.   discuß   ,0

2888,2888, dubious claims about clearly nontransgenderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. this isnt a list of people who kinda sorta theres a small chance maybe are transgender.the ones who crossdressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it. the only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is guan yin. the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something e.g. military service or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. they did it for deceptive purposes as well so they cant really be considered transgendered.the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. if they accused her of being a witch should we have included her in a list of witches too? also id like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that its most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact.and what are transvestite tendencies in reference to ed wood? you need to start citing sources or im just going to start deleting them. that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.maxwell klinger wasnt even a real transvestite he only did that so hed get a section and get kicked out of the army. anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a transvestite he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality. whats the association between the two?also it appears theyre using a warped definition of transgender here. ive never heard a definition that would automatically include crossdressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. im sorry but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. june utc,0

2893,2893,==street gang==mr. davisthanks for your note on my talk page i really appreciate it and its an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book. as this articles creator and main editor im sorry that you thought the review section was so negative. please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book. in my rush to get the article published i did a google search and those are the reviews i found. also please understand that this is a wikipedia article and the article as it now stands will never be complete. its a work in progress. i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there. i am by no means a professional writer so im certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors. i wouldve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work. i appreciate your feedback something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor. if you are aware of other sources that i wasnt able to locate please send them my way on my talk page. ill repeat this message via your webpage to ensure that you see it.you should also know that ive taken it upon myself to improve all sesame streetrelated articles on wikipedia. its a big project and a great need. for example sesame street at one point was actually a featured article but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons. its an unfortunate state at the current time. your book came out shortly after i took on the project so its been a boom for me. i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start so your book has been a valuable resource. ive already started working on this article history of sesame street and if you look at the reference section youll see that ive used your book extensively. its also a work in progess and no where near finished. my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame streets th anniversary in november. i cant tell you how much your book has helped me.on a personal level i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book. it was a fun read and immensely interesting. i was brought to tears many times especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air. see im turning this year which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it. i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized they did all that for me i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly and now the life of my own children who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do. i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia and ive taken it upon myself to help accomplish that. if you as the ultimate expert could assist me in that goal i cant tell you how valuable that would be. again thanks for the feedback and communication. ,0

2900,2900,its not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory but indeed the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about jewish leaders in the bolshevik movement. there was a recent newspiece a quote by putin times of israel putin first soviet government was mostly jewish. apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say its just a statement of a statistical fact. in any case the option is the article shouldnt imply any notion of jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. however im not sure if that general topic jews in the bolshevik movement should be covered in detail in this article.,0

2902,2902,you claim yet again that the text for example indiabased iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources. this is incorrect as both sources support both these assertions. brian krebs a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog krebs on security tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up. ... then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what iyogi put on my computer ... and ... iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions ... proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics. it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided. and yes it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company. contributions talk ,0
2903,2903,jung and einstein in albert einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in aarau switzerland. in after school in switzerland einstein renounced his german citizenship. carl p. jung was born in in the swiss canton or county of thurgau. while jung worked on wandlungen und symbole der libido psychology of the unconscious tensions grew between freud and jung. frank p. geyer continued to serve as a detective until august when he resigned. he had been transferred to the th police district in the united states. detective geyer had arrested james anderson whether this is the same anderson mentioned in detective geyers work is nondeterminable. in tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. in albert einstein acquired swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper obtaining a teaching position at school in schaffhausen switzerland. the fbi file on einstein came to light in when robert alan schwartz wrote an article on the subject for the nation magazine. between j. edgar hoover and john hutchison democratic rights didn’t stop with mccarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of socalled notorious j. edgar hoover. yet for years zeropoint energy according to hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. john hutchisons claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are like nasa. the fbi should do an article on nasa and their nondeterminable webers.i do not find it too surprising schwartz once more wrote about not only frank geyer but albert einstein with not too much said about carl p. jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.,0
2904,2904, msa garratts hithe idea about an article is a good one but unfortunately youve started out with an error. that is understandable as the subject is complex. the wagr first imported the m class garratts in . these are very important locos because they are the third class of garratt to be built and the first main line garratt showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. they were followed up in by the ms class only difference being the ms class were superheated. so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. both classes were built by beyerpeacock.the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops. apparently a copy of the ms class they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.the story does not end there but moves to victoria. the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. outside framed garratts are very rare even in the smaller gauges. but wait there is more no not steak knives. the design was used again for the australian portland cements line near geelong the first loco being supplied in and the second in . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g.so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years used on three railway on two gauges and built by two manufacturers with if ive added it up correctly locos constructed.personally i think the article should cover the history of the design and include all the varients. some work would be required to hunt down variations though. so yes i think it does deserve an article.please feel free to use the above if you wish.cheersmichael.,0

2923,2923,controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip. in actuality it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology. in other words because they have taken issue with the laymans wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around. so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy. mw dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly im referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case mw. i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can just as you shortened it to mw. rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means. i agree the dictionary isnt for giving an exhaustive description thats what encyclopedias are for. however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine. the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines. the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable. agreement clearly some people dont agree with mw just as you and i dont agree with saamis statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines. the experts on weapons have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips. just because you and i disagree with saamis statement doesnt mean it should be taken out as a reference and id never suggest that.what i suggest is a compromise. i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or. mw however doesnt fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use. do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated? without saying its wrong because it clearly isnt according to common usage. im thinking something like this....clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however mw defines it as such.this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms there is a controversy and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated. i think this is fair. note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what youre saying here. im not interested in destroying your view only presenting both sides fairly. ,0

2978,2978, april utc the game is an abstract mental game the objective of which is to forget its existence. there is no point in calling the game a meme the majority of stuff on wikipedia is a meme. a meme is simply any idea or concept. i think what this refers to is a common misconception of the word meme basically meaning a fad. the game has some interesting memetic properties but these should be described elsewhere in the article if anywhere. whoever wants the meme version up should read the meme article first. ,0
2979,2979,i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe especially given that in a prior version you yourself wroteattempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not workwhich it seems to me is the very essence of extreme red tape. if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness but i dont see how that better informs the reader.i also dont see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what theyve been tasked to do. to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous of course that was the goal. and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. your wording doesnt mention any of that stuff anyway.further as ive said before i also dont see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking the important points are a the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. what doesnt matter is just what it was that was lacking typists? paperclips? light bulbs?some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of for want of a nailtype angle look prime minister youve gathered all these firstclass minds here but we cant get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing if sources lay something like that out.am i missing something? p.s. what do you mean about wpciv?,0
2980,2980,none beefart repliesthanks for you comments. few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles. i disagree with you about none. the word comes from the old norse ne an which means literally no one. in my view to get the sense of any usage of none we must expand it in our minds to no one. it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs. it has to be no one is a dinosaur. here are two examples from the oed e.j. howard except for her eyes none of her features was remarkable. p. rose people sought her... but none was a companion. however the plot thickens because the oed also gives this example from graham greene who is highly regarded as a writer none of our wives are invited. this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight. maybe i ought to as well . there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. e.g. none of the increase is due to.... here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing. i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase... ,0

2984,2984, the truth about the sinn féin ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party. how he broke the sinn féin constitution created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn féin membership. and how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. in section b. of the sinn féin constitution read as follows“no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. the adams leadership put forward a motion titled resolution at the ard fheis. its wording was as follows resolution that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle.b. shall not draw their salaries for personal use. parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser’s subsidy and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.to accommodate this change the constitution and rules be amended as followsthat section b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who if elected intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who if elected would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the ard chomhairle. obviously motion infringes section b. section b. was in effect at the time this resolution was presented. its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure. he should have sought a majority decision to amend section b. in and returned in to propose entering leinster house. trying to amend section b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist county parliament” in the same resolution was a logical impossibility. can anybody say that the wording“that this ardfheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house. successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county electionsa. shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle”does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle?clearly adams was in breach of section b. and according to that section he had expelled himself and all those who voted for resolution .brian feeney in his book sinn féin turbulent years puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section b by introducing a motion in allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the sinn féin constitution. this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section b in any way. to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. for example conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. in fact the line adams added in was superfluous as the sinn féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.of course its not illegal to amend or remove section b. section b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies. it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority. the reason for doing so could be many. perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic. in fact its not necessary according to the constitution to give any reason. but you,0
